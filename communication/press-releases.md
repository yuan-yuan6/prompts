# Press Release & Media Communications Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for creating press releases, media statements, journalist communications, and media relations strategies that maximize coverage, maintain credibility, and effectively communicate key messages to target audiences.

## Quick Start

**Need to create a press release quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Our fintech startup just secured $10M Series A funding led by a prominent venture capital firm. I need to write a press release announcing the funding round, our growth plans, and market opportunity to distribute to TechCrunch, VentureBeat, and local business media to generate coverage and credibility.
```

### When to Use This
- Announcing major milestones like funding rounds, acquisitions, or partnerships
- Launching new products, services, or entering new markets
- Sharing executive appointments, awards, or significant company achievements
- Responding to industry news or positioning as expert commentary source

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Write Core Release** - Create headline, lead paragraph with who/what/when/where/why, supporting paragraphs with details, executive quotes, and company boilerplate following AP style
2. **Target Media List** - Identify 15-20 relevant journalists covering your industry beat, research their recent articles, and customize pitches highlighting why your news matters to their audience
3. **Distribute and Follow Up** - Send personalized pitches to top-tier journalists 2-3 days before embargo, distribute broadly on release day, and follow up with reporters showing interest

**Time to complete**: 2-3 hours for basic press release, 1-2 days for comprehensive media outreach campaign
