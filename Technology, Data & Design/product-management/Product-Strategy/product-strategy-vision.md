# Product Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess product strategy quality and vision clarity across six dimensions: Market Understanding, Vision & Positioning, Strategic Choices, Value Delivery, Execution Planning, and Organizational Alignment. This framework identifies strategy gaps, strengthens strategic thinking, and creates development roadmaps for compelling product direction that inspires teams and guides multi-year execution.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive product strategy readiness assessment for {PRODUCT_CONTEXT}, targeting {MARKET_OPPORTUNITY} to achieve {STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Market Understanding Readiness**

Assess whether strategy is grounded in deep market insight versus assumptions or wishful thinking. Evaluate market sizing rigor including whether total addressable market is calculated bottoms-up from customer segments and buying patterns rather than top-down industry analyst reports extrapolation. Examine customer problem validation determining whether pain points are validated through extensive customer interviews, usage data analysis, and willingness-to-pay research versus anecdotal feedback or founder intuition. Review jobs-to-be-done clarity including whether functional, emotional, and social jobs customers hire product for are explicitly articulated with supporting evidence. Analyze competitive intelligence depth determining whether direct competitors, indirect alternatives, and emerging threats are systematically tracked with win-loss analysis informing positioning. Assess market trend analysis including whether technology shifts, regulatory changes, buyer behavior evolution, and category maturity are monitored with implications for strategy. Evaluate timing rationale determining whether "why now" is compelling with evidence that market conditions create opportunity window versus generic always-valid reasoning.

**2. Vision & Positioning Readiness**

Evaluate whether product vision inspires teams and positioning differentiates in market. Assess vision clarity and inspiration including whether vision statement paints vivid future state that energizes team, attracts talent, and guides decision-making versus vague platitudes like best-in-class or world-leading. Examine vision specificity determining whether vision describes concrete customer outcomes and market impact with measurable ambition versus generic statements that could apply to any product. Review positioning distinctiveness including whether positioning owns specific category or creates new category versus positioning as better version of existing category leaders. Analyze value proposition strength determining whether functional benefits, emotional benefits, and economic value are articulated with proof points and customer evidence. Assess differentiation sustainability including whether competitive advantages are based on durable capabilities, network effects, or IP versus easily replicated features. Evaluate brand strategy alignment determining whether product positioning reinforces company brand or creates confusion, and whether messaging is consistent across channels.

**3. Strategic Choices Readiness**

Assess whether strategy involves clear choices and tradeoffs versus trying to serve everyone. Evaluate target market focus including whether ideal customer profile is narrowly defined beyond demographics to specific use cases, pain severity, and buying patterns enabling focused execution. Examine strategic pillar definition determining whether three to four strategic themes represent opinionated bets about how to win versus generic priorities like user experience and performance that any product should have. Review explicit tradeoffs including whether strategy documents what company chooses NOT to do, which customer segments to deprioritize, and which features to exclude clarifying boundaries. Analyze strategic bets identification determining whether major hypotheses are articulated with expected outcomes, investment levels, success criteria, and risk mitigation if bets fail. Assess competitive strategy clarity including whether approach is premium positioning, value positioning, or category creation with clear rationale versus undefined competitive stance. Evaluate international expansion strategy determining whether geographic expansion sequencing, localization depth, and market entry approach are defined or left vague.

**4. Value Delivery Readiness**

Evaluate whether business model and economics support strategic ambition. Assess business model validation including whether monetization approach, pricing strategy, and revenue streams are tested with customers versus theoretical constructs awaiting validation. Examine unit economics health determining whether customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, gross margin, and payback period support profitable growth with clear path to target economics. Review growth model definition including whether customer acquisition, activation, retention, and expansion mechanisms are designed with specific tactics and owned metrics. Analyze north star metric selection determining whether single metric captures value creation for customers and business, with clear rationale why this metric versus alternatives. Assess financial projections realism including whether revenue targets, customer counts, and resource requirements are bottoms-up models based on conversion rates and capacity versus arbitrary goals. Evaluate pricing strategy strength determining whether value-based pricing is supported by willingness-to-pay research, competitive analysis, and clear tier differentiation.

**5. Execution Planning Readiness**

Assess whether strategy translates into executable roadmap with clear initiatives and resource allocation. Evaluate strategic initiative definition including whether major bets and projects clearly connect to strategic pillars with problem statements, success metrics, and timeline expectations. Examine resource allocation alignment determining whether budget, headcount, and team focus match stated strategic priorities versus misalignment where strategy says one thing but resources flow elsewhere. Review success metrics cascade including whether strategic objectives decompose into product OKRs, team goals, and individual metrics creating line-of-sight from daily work to strategy. Analyze milestone planning determining whether multi-year strategy breaks into annual themes, quarterly priorities, and specific deliverables enabling progress tracking. Assess capability gap identification including whether required skills, technology platforms, partnerships, and organizational structure changes are mapped with acquisition or development plans. Evaluate risk mitigation including whether market risks, competitive risks, execution risks, and technology risks have documented contingency plans and decision triggers.

**6. Organizational Alignment Readiness**

Evaluate whether organization understands, believes in, and executes against strategy. Assess team comprehension including whether product managers, engineers, designers, and cross-functional partners can articulate strategy in two minutes with consistent messaging. Examine executive sponsorship determining whether CEO, board, and executive team actively champion strategy, allocate resources accordingly, and hold organization accountable to strategic goals. Review cross-functional alignment including whether go-to-market teams, engineering, design, and operations have shared understanding of priorities, target customers, and success metrics. Analyze strategy communication effectiveness determining whether strategy is communicated through multiple formats—narrative documents, visual presentations, team meetings—with regular updates as strategy evolves. Assess decision-making clarity including whether strategy provides sufficient guidance for teams to make tactical decisions without escalation, with clear escalation paths for strategic decisions. Evaluate incentive alignment determining whether compensation, performance reviews, and recognition systems reward behaviors and outcomes aligned with strategic priorities.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Strategy Overview** providing current vision statement, strategic pillars, target market definition, key differentiators, and three-to-five year ambition.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Strategy Strengths** listing what's working well including clear positioning, validated insights, or strong alignment worth protecting and amplifying.

4. **Strategic Gaps** identifying critical weaknesses ranked by impact on execution and competitive position, with specific recommendations for strengthening strategy.

5. **Development Roadmap** providing phased actions: immediate clarifications within thirty days addressing confusion or misalignment, strategic refinements within ninety days strengthening positioning or pillar definition, and long-term evolution over six to twelve months building strategic capabilities.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what excellent strategy looks like including team comprehension score, market differentiation rating, execution velocity metrics, and business outcomes.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with vague strategy and weak market understanding, 2.0-2.9 Developing with basic strategy but unclear differentiation, 3.0-3.9 Defined with solid strategy and clear positioning, 4.0-4.9 Managed with compelling strategy and strong execution, 5.0 Optimized with exceptional strategy and category leadership.

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Strategic Repositioning**

Conduct a comprehensive product strategy readiness assessment for a growth-stage B2B collaboration platform with three million ARR and sixty employees struggling with competitive differentiation as market becomes crowded with similar offerings from well-funded startups and incumbent enterprise players, targeting distributed teams at venture-backed technology companies from fifty to five hundred employees seeking async-first communication and AI-powered productivity, to achieve fifteen million ARR within three years by owning distributed team collaboration category through differentiated AI capabilities while expanding upmarket to larger enterprises. The assessment should address market understanding gaps examining whether customer research validates async-first as genuine need versus founder belief, vision clarity determining if future state is inspiring beyond vague productivity gains, strategic pillar differentiation assessing whether AI focus and async-first principles are truly differentiated versus table stakes, business model validation examining if freemium-to-paid conversion assumptions are tested, execution planning determining if roadmap clearly connects to strategic pillars, and organizational alignment examining if team understands repositioning rationale and believes in new direction.

**Example 2: Consumer Mobile App Strategy Development**

Conduct a comprehensive product strategy readiness assessment for an early-stage consumer fintech startup six months post-launch with fifty thousand downloads but unclear product-market fit and strategy, targeting Gen Z users aged eighteen to twenty-eight seeking financial literacy and automated savings tools competing against established apps like Acorns and Chime, to achieve one million active users and twenty million revenue within two years by creating social-first financial wellness platform that makes money management engaging through gamification and community. The assessment should address market sizing rigor examining whether five million addressable Gen Z users estimate is bottoms-up validated, competitive positioning weakness determining if social-first angle is differentiated or incremental, strategic choices ambiguity assessing whether target age range is too broad and use cases undefined, growth model gaps examining whether viral loops and community-driven acquisition are designed versus assumed, north star metric selection determining if metric captures both engagement and monetization, and execution planning examining whether pivot from solo savings app to social platform is resourced appropriately.

**Example 3: Enterprise Platform Multi-Year Strategy**

Conduct a comprehensive product strategy readiness assessment for an established enterprise data platform company with two hundred million ARR and eight hundred employees planning three-year strategic refresh as cloud-native competitors threaten legacy architecture advantage, targeting Fortune 1000 enterprises with complex data infrastructure needs seeking unified data management across hybrid cloud environments, to achieve five hundred million ARR by expanding from data warehousing into broader data platform with AI and machine learning capabilities while defending core business from Snowflake and Databricks. The assessment should address market trend analysis examining whether shift to cloud-native architecture is temporary or permanent requiring architectural pivot, vision inspiring leadership determining whether platform expansion vision energizes engineering team facing technical debt, strategic pillar coherence assessing whether defending core business while expanding platform creates conflicting priorities, unit economics evolution examining whether cloud delivery model maintains gross margins of on-premise business, capability gaps identification determining whether AI and ML talent and technology can be acquired fast enough, and cross-functional alignment examining whether sales compensation and customer success metrics support platform expansion versus protecting legacy revenue.
