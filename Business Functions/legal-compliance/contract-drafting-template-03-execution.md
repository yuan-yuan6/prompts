# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment - Part 3: Execution & Management

## Purpose
Assess readiness to execute, govern, and manage contracts post-signature across six dimensions: Execution Mechanics, Records & Evidence, Obligations Tracking, Change Control & Amendments, Renewal/Exit Lifecycle, and Governance & Continuous Improvement. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce a contract-ops roadmap.

## Template

Conduct a contract execution & management readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} implementing a {CONTRACT_TYPE} with {COUNTERPARTY}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. EXECUTION MECHANICS READINESS**
- Signature policy (wet vs e-sign) and enforceability requirements are known
- Signatory authority and approvals are verified (delegations, board approvals)
- Required attachments are identified (SOWs, exhibits, security addenda)
- Counterparty execution expectations are aligned (order, counterparts, timestamps)
- Internal intake and routing is defined (who reviews what, when)
- Close checklist exists (final QC before signature)

**2. RECORDS, EVIDENCE & AUDIT READINESS**
- Final agreement package completeness (all schedules, redlines resolved, versions)
- Storage system is searchable and access-controlled (metadata, tags, permissions)
- Audit evidence is retained (approvals, exception logs, certificates)
- Notice addresses and communication channels are captured and monitored
- Retention and deletion rules exist (legal hold, privacy requirements)
- Third-party documents and certificates are tracked (insurance, SOC reports)

**3. OBLIGATIONS, SLAs & PERFORMANCE TRACKING READINESS**
- Material obligations extracted (deliverables, reporting, audit rights, notices)
- Owners assigned for each obligation (legal, finance, ops, security, product)
- SLA measurement and dispute process defined (data source, calculations, timelines)
- Payment/fees and invoicing controls are operationalized
- Customer/counterparty obligations monitored (dependencies, cooperation duties)
- Issue management path exists (breaches, cure periods, escalation)

**4. CHANGE CONTROL & AMENDMENTS READINESS**
- Amendment/SOW change process exists (request, impact, approvals, documentation)
- Version control discipline (single source of truth; no “side letters” lost)
- Pricing/term changes tracked with effective dates and dependencies
- Compliance/security changes routed correctly (privacy, security, regulatory)
- Exceptions policy exists (who can approve deviations and how to record them)
- Standard templates for amendments/renewals exist (reduces errors)

**5. RENEWAL, EXIT & TRANSITION READINESS**
- Key dates tracked (renewal notice, auto-renew, termination windows)
- Exit plan defined (data return, transition assistance, decommissioning)
- Post-termination obligations understood (confidentiality, IP, audits)
- Renewal decision inputs defined (performance, spend, risk, alternatives)
- Vendor risk lifecycle integrated (periodic reviews, re-validation)
- Transition communications plan exists (internal + external)

**6. GOVERNANCE & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
- Contract ops cadence (weekly/monthly) with action logs and owners
- KPI/KRI set exists (cycle time, exceptions, SLA breaches, audit findings)
- Cross-functional coordination mechanisms (legal, procurement, security, finance)
- Lessons learned captured and fed back into templates/playbooks
- Training and enablement (how to use templates, when to escalate)
- Tooling roadmap (CLM adoption/optimization if applicable)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 execution/ops risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **CLOSE & HANDOFF CHECKLIST** - What must be captured at signature and handed to owners

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions

5. **90-DAY STABILIZATION ROADMAP** - Actions across records, obligations, change control, governance

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Faster cycle time, fewer missed obligations, fewer audit exceptions

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (documents scattered, obligations unmanaged)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic storage, inconsistent tracking)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable execution, owned obligations)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined CLM/ops, proactive renewals)
- 5.0: Optimized (measured, automated where valuable, continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Contracting organization | "Apex Manufacturing" |
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "Supplier master agreement" |
| `[COUNTERPARTY]` | Counterparty | "Global Components Ltd." |

## Example

**Manufacturing - Supplier Agreement**

> Assess contract execution & management readiness for **Apex Manufacturing** implementing a **supplier master agreement** with **Global Components Ltd.** (1) Execution—signatory authority is unclear and signatures occur by email without a close checklist. (2) Records—final exhibits and certificates are stored separately; audit evidence is missing. (3) Obligations—delivery SLAs exist but there’s no owner or measurement source; notice obligations aren’t monitored. (4) Change control—pricing changes are handled informally and aren’t versioned. (5) Renewal/exit—auto-renewal dates are not tracked; no transition plan exists. (6) Governance—no contract ops cadence; recurring issues don’t feed back into templates. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day stabilization roadmap.
