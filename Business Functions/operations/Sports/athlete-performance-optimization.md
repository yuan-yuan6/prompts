# Athlete Performance & Training Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to **optimize athletic performance** through evidence-based training, recovery protocols, injury prevention, and performance monitoring. Use this to diagnose gaps in periodization, load management, and athlete support systems.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **athlete performance readiness** for {ATHLETE_CONTEXT}. The performance objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct an athlete performance & training readiness assessment for {ATHLETE_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (performance metrics, injury rates, recovery quality, training adaptation).

**1) TRAINING PERIODIZATION & PROGRAMMING**
- Annual plan follows periodization principles (prep, competition, transition phases)
- Training load progresses systematically (volume → intensity → specificity)
- Programs are individualized to athlete needs and response
- Microcycles balance stress and recovery (not constant grinding)

**2) PERFORMANCE MONITORING & DATA-DRIVEN ADJUSTMENT**
- Key performance indicators are tracked consistently (speed, power, endurance, skill)
- Load monitoring prevents overtraining (GPS, HRV, session RPE, wellness)
- Data informs training adjustments in near real-time (not retrospective only)
- Testing protocols are valid, reliable, and actionable

**3) RECOVERY & REGENERATION SYSTEMS**
- Sleep is prioritized and monitored (8+ hours, quality tracked)
- Nutrition supports training demands (periodized, hydration, supplements)
- Active recovery modalities are evidence-based (massage, compression, cryo, hydro)
- Recovery is individualized and load-responsive (not one-size-fits-all)

**4) INJURY PREVENTION & LOAD MANAGEMENT**
- Risk screening identifies vulnerable athletes (movement, history, workload)
- Prehabilitation is integrated into training (not bolted-on)
- Load spikes are managed (acute:chronic workload ratio monitored)
- Return-to-play protocols are progressive and criteria-based

**5) MENTAL SKILLS & PSYCHOLOGICAL READINESS**
- Mental skills training is integrated (goal-setting, visualization, self-talk, focus)
- Pressure and competition scenarios are practiced
- Mental health is monitored and supported (stress, burnout, anxiety)
- Confidence and resilience are developed systematically

**6) MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM & EXPERTISE**
- Coaches, sports scientists, physios, psychologists, nutritionists collaborate
- Evidence-based methods guide decisions (not just tradition or anecdote)
- Expertise gaps are filled (hiring, upskilling, partnerships)
- Athlete-centered approach prioritizes long-term development over short-term results

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad hoc training, high injury risk, no monitoring, reactive)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic plans, inconsistent execution, limited individualization)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid periodization, growing monitoring, proactive recovery)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (data-driven, low injuries, optimized systems, elite support)
- 5.0: Optimized (world-class, continuous innovation, peak performance culture)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {ATHLETE_CONTEXT}: Sport, athlete level, training age, performance/injury status
- {OBJECTIVES}: Performance gains, injury reduction, competition readiness goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Budget, facilities, staff expertise, training time, competition schedule

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {ATHLETE_CONTEXT}: Collegiate track & field program (40 athletes, middle-distance runners + sprinters). Training age 3–6 years. Current season: 30% PR improvement rate (goal 50%), 40% injury rate/year (goal <15%), avg 6.5 hrs sleep (goal 8+). Facilities: basic weight room, track, no sports science lab. Staff: 2 coaches (no sports scientist, physio, or psychologist).
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase PR rate to 50%, reduce injury rate to 15%, achieve 3 conference championships, prepare 5 athletes for nationals.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $30K annual budget; no dedicated sports science staff; limited testing equipment; 20 hrs/week training window (academic load); competition season Feb–May.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.6 (Developing)
- Key risks: 40% injury rate threatens season; lack of periodization limits performance gains; no sports science staff leaves gaps in monitoring/recovery
- Top improvements: (1) implement periodization framework, (2) add load monitoring (HRV, GPS), (3) partner with sports science grad program for support

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Training Periodization & Programming: 2/5 — no formal annual plan; training similar year-round; limited individualization
- Performance Monitoring & Data: 2/5 — track times/distances logged; no GPS, HRV, or wellness tracking; testing ad hoc
- Recovery & Regeneration: 2/5 — avg 6.5 hrs sleep (insufficient); basic nutrition guidance; no recovery modalities
- Injury Prevention & Load Management: 2/5 — reactive (treat injuries, don't prevent); no screening; load spikes common
- Mental Skills & Readiness: 3/5 — coaches emphasize mindset; no formal mental skills training; high competition anxiety
- Multidisciplinary Team: 2/5 — 2 coaches only; no physio, sports scientist, nutritionist, or psychologist on staff

**3) PERFORMANCE & INJURY PROFILE**
- Current performance benchmarks (40 athletes):
  - 800m: avg 2:02 (top 1:55, goal 1:52 for nationals)

  - Stress fractures (3 cases): load management failure, nutrition gaps, female athlete triad
  - IT band syndrome (2 cases): biomechanical, weak glutes, volume spikes
  - Achilles tendinopathy (2 cases): training surface changes, load errors
- Risk factors: 60% have movement screening red flags (asymmetry, weakness, poor mobility); 30% history of recurring injuries; female athletes at higher risk (triad not addressed)

- 90 days: measure injury rate (goal <25% for season, down from 40%), PR rate (goal 40%, up from 30%), sleep (goal 7.2 hrs avg), HRV trends (identify responders/non-responders); introduce mental skills workshop (visualization, pre-race routine, 2 hours); refine periodization based on early season data
- Metrics: injury rate (goal <25% by season end), PR rate (goal 40% by season end), sleep (goal 7.2 hrs by 90 days), HRV compliance (goal 80% daily), movement screening score (goal 15/21 avg, up from 12)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Follow periodization principles: progress from volume → intensity → specificity; include prep, competition, and transition phases.
2) Monitor training load religiously: use GPS, HRV, session RPE, and wellness to catch overtraining before injury.
3) Individualize training and recovery: athletes respond differently—adjust based on data, not one-size-fits-all.
4) Prioritize sleep as performance enhancement: 8+ hours beats most supplements and recovery modalities.
5) Prevent injuries proactively: screen for risks, integrate prehab, manage load spikes—don't just treat after injury.
6) Integrate mental skills systematically: visualization, goal-setting, and pre-performance routines improve consistency.
7) Build a multidisciplinary team: coaches + sports scientist + physio + nutritionist + psychologist = complete support.
8) Use data to inform decisions: test, track, analyze, adjust—intuition is valuable but data validates it.
