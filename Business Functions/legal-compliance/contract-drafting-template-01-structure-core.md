# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment - Part 1: Structure & Core Clauses

## Purpose
Assess readiness to produce a clear, enforceable contract foundation (structure and core clauses) across six dimensions: Deal Context & Intent, Parties & Authority, Definitions & Interpretation, Core Commercial Terms, Core IP/Confidentiality/Data Terms, and Document Architecture. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce a drafting checklist and workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **contract drafting readiness (structure & core clauses)** for **[ORGANIZATION]** drafting a **[CONTRACT_TYPE]** under **[JURISDICTION]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Deal context**—are objectives, scope boundaries, and success criteria clear enough to draft precisely? (2) **Parties & authority**—are legal entities, signatories, and affiliates correctly identified and authorized? (3) **Definitions & interpretation**—are key terms unambiguous and consistently used across schedules/SOWs? (4) **Core commercial terms**—are scope, deliverables, fees, payment, and acceptance clear and testable? (5) **Core IP/confidentiality/data**—are baseline confidentiality and IP allocations clear enough to avoid rework later? (6) **Document architecture**—are schedules/exhibits referenced correctly, prioritized, and version-controlled? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top gaps, and a drafting workflow/checklist.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid contract-structure readiness evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a contract drafting readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} drafting a {CONTRACT_TYPE} under {JURISDICTION}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. DEAL CONTEXT & INTENT READINESS**
- Business objectives and value exchange are explicit (what each party gives/gets)
- Scope boundaries are defined (in-scope, out-of-scope, assumptions, dependencies)
- Commercial model clarity (fixed fee, T&M, subscription, usage-based, milestones)
- Delivery model clarity (one-time, recurring, phased rollout)
- Critical constraints captured (timelines, operational requirements, approvals)
- “Done” definition for the core relationship (what constitutes performance)

**2. PARTIES, CAPACITY & AUTHORITY READINESS**
- Correct legal names and entity details (including affiliates/subsidiaries where needed)
- Authority verified (signatory capacity, approvals, delegations)
- Counterparty diligence inputs available (credit, sanctions/KYC as applicable)
- Role clarity (customer, vendor, reseller, processor/sub-processor, subcontractors)
- Notices and contact mechanisms defined (addresses, permitted methods, timelines)
- Assignment/affiliate use expectations are aligned with the structure

**3. DEFINITIONS & INTERPRETATION READINESS**
- Key terms defined (services, deliverables, acceptance, confidential information)
- Consistency across documents (main agreement vs SOW vs exhibits)
- Interpretation rules set (order of precedence; headings; severability behaviors)
- Ambiguity hotspots addressed (reasonable efforts, material breach, business day)
- Cross-references correct and stable (avoid circular or outdated references)
- Term consistency with internal clause library/playbooks

**4. CORE COMMERCIAL TERMS READINESS**
- Scope and deliverables are concrete (inputs/outputs, responsibilities, timelines)
- Fees/pricing and payment mechanics are complete (invoices, taxes, timing)
- Acceptance criteria and process are defined (tests, time windows, deemed acceptance)
- Change mechanism for scope/commercials exists (requests, impact, approvals)
- Service levels/quality baseline stated where relevant (or intentionally deferred)
- Dependencies and customer responsibilities are specified (access, data, SMEs)

**5. CORE IP, CONFIDENTIALITY & DATA TERMS (BASELINE)**
- Confidentiality scope and exclusions are clear; permitted disclosures defined
- IP ownership baseline is clear (pre-existing vs developed; background vs foreground)
- License grants are explicit (term, territory, purpose, sublicensing)
- Data handling baseline is defined (data types, permitted use, retention/deletion)
- Security obligations baseline stated (or tied to a referenced standard)
- Publicity/branding use (if any) addressed

**6. DOCUMENT ARCHITECTURE & QUALITY READINESS**
- Document structure makes sense (main terms vs SOWs vs exhibits) and is navigable
- Order of precedence defined (main agreement overrides vs exhibit overrides)
- Schedules/exhibits are enumerated and referenced consistently
- Version control and redline conventions established
- Boilerplate is coherent (definitions used; no conflicting provisions)
- Review workflow defined (legal, commercial, privacy/security, finance)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 drafting risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **STRUCTURE & CORE CLAUSE CHECKLIST** - Required sections + key decisions/inputs needed

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended fixes

5. **DRAFTING WORKFLOW** - Owners, review gates, and a 2-week drafting plan

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Fewer redline loops, fewer ambiguities, faster approval cycle time

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, ambiguous, inconsistent templates)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic structure, frequent rework)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable structure, clear core terms)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (consistent clause library, efficient review workflow)
- 5.0: Optimized (high-quality drafting system, low rework, fast cycle times)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Contracting organization | "Pinecrest Analytics" |
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "SaaS MSA + Order Form" |
| `[JURISDICTION]` | Governing law / jurisdiction | "New York" |

## Example

**Technology - SaaS MSA**

> Assess contract drafting readiness (structure & core clauses) for **Pinecrest Analytics** drafting a **SaaS MSA + Order Form** under **New York**. (1) Deal context—scope is clear, but customer responsibilities for data and access are missing. (2) Parties—affiliate usage is expected but not reflected; signatory authority is not confirmed. (3) Definitions—“Services” and “Subscription” are used inconsistently across the MSA and order form. (4) Commercial terms—acceptance is undefined; change requests lack a pricing mechanism. (5) IP/confidentiality/data—confidentiality is standard, but data retention/deletion expectations are unclear. (6) Architecture—order of precedence between MSA, order form, and security exhibit is missing. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a drafting checklist/workflow to close gaps before risk provisions.
