## Template

Conduct a comprehensive game design readiness assessment for {GAME_TITLE}, a {GAME_TYPE} game targeting {TARGET_PLATFORM}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. Core Design Vision Readiness** — Evaluating whether the fundamental game concept demonstrates clarity of purpose through a well-defined core gameplay loop that articulates precisely what players do moment-to-moment and why it's inherently satisfying, examining whether the player fantasy is compelling and delivers a clear emotional promise about the power or experience players will feel, determining whether the unique selling proposition differentiates meaningfully from competitors through innovative mechanics or narrative hooks rather than superficial features, assessing whether emotional goals align with game type by targeting appropriate feelings (mastery for skill games, discovery for exploration games, connection for social games, creativity for sandbox games), verifying whether the visual style and art direction communicate genre and tone immediately while supporting gameplay readability, examining whether comparable game analysis demonstrates understanding of market expectations and identifies genuine innovation opportunities rather than derivative copying, determining whether the core concept can sustain player engagement across the intended play duration without repetitive fatigue, and assessing whether the creative vision remains coherent when translated across narrative elements, mechanical systems, level design, and user interface rather than fragmenting into disconnected components.

**2. Narrative & World-Building Readiness** — Assessing whether story structure follows appropriate dramatic arcs with clear setup, rising action, climax, and resolution beats that align with gameplay pacing rather than fighting against player agency, examining whether protagonist development creates compelling character arcs with clear motivation, meaningful choices, and satisfying growth that transforms through player actions rather than passive cutscenes, determining whether antagonist design provides worthy opposition through understandable motivations and methods that challenge player capabilities while remaining thematically consistent, evaluating whether supporting characters serve distinct narrative functions beyond exposition delivery through unique voices, meaningful relationships with the protagonist, and their own mini-arcs that enrich world depth, verifying whether world-building demonstrates internal consistency through coherent history, culture, geography, and technology levels that players can learn and anticipate, examining whether environmental storytelling embeds narrative context through level design, object placement, visual details, and ambient elements that reward observant players without requiring explicit text dumps, determining whether story delivery mechanisms balance player control and narrative impact through appropriate use of cutscenes, in-game dialogue, environmental clues, optional lore, and player-driven discovery, and assessing whether branching narrative systems (if present) create meaningfully different outcomes rather than superficial choice illusions that converge to identical endpoints regardless of player decisions.

**3. Mechanics & Systems Readiness** — Evaluating whether core mechanics demonstrate intrinsic fun through immediate player feedback, clear cause-and-effect relationships, satisfying tactile response, and learning curves that reward mastery without punishing experimentation, examining whether primary mechanics interact synergistically to create emergent gameplay opportunities where combining systems produces more interesting outcomes than using each in isolation, determining whether secondary mechanics support rather than distract from core gameplay by providing strategic depth, pacing variation, or accessibility options without fragmenting focus, assessing whether progression systems balance power growth with maintained challenge through appropriate difficulty curves, enemy scaling, gear progression, skill unlocks, or level design that prevents both overwhelming difficulty and trivializing content, verifying whether resource management creates meaningful strategic decisions through scarcity that forces prioritization, conversion systems that enable tactical flexibility, and acquisition methods that reward varied playstyles, examining whether combat systems (if applicable) balance accessibility for casual players and skill expression for dedicated players through scalable difficulty, optional advanced techniques, adaptive AI, or control scheme flexibility, determining whether player feedback systems communicate game state clearly through visual indicators, audio cues, haptic response, UI notifications, and character animations that prevent confusion about damage taken, ability cooldowns, resource levels, or objective status, and assessing whether balance philosophy serves intended player experience by tuning difficulty to match target audience skill levels, maintaining competitive fairness in multiplayer contexts, preserving build diversity in character customization systems, and avoiding dominant strategies that invalidate alternative approaches.

**4. Level & Environment Design Readiness** — Assessing whether spatial design philosophy aligns with intended player experience through appropriate use of linear guided paths for narrative focus, open exploration spaces for discovery fantasy, hub-and-spoke structures for strategic choice, or metroidvania interconnection for satisfying mastery progression, examining whether pacing strategies create rhythm variations through action intensity fluctuations, quiet exploration moments, puzzle-solving breaks, story revelation beats, and challenge escalation that prevents both exhaustion and boredom, determining whether player guidance systems balance freedom and direction through environmental lighting, landmark visibility, path narrowing, objective markers, or subtle visual cues that guide without hand-holding for intended challenge level, evaluating whether challenge curves introduce mechanics gradually through tutorial sections that teach through play rather than text dumps, steadily escalate difficulty as player skills develop, remix learned mechanics in novel combinations, and culminate in climactic tests that validate mastery, verifying whether exploration rewards justify player curiosity through meaningful collectibles providing gameplay benefits, hidden story revelations deepening world understanding, secret areas offering unique challenges, or environmental puzzles rewarding observational skills, examining whether environmental storytelling embeds narrative context through architecture communicating function and history, object placement implying past events, visual details revealing character through environment, lighting and color palettes establishing mood, and environmental progression reflecting story beats, determining whether replayability factors provide reasons for multiple playthroughs through branching paths with exclusive content, randomized elements changing layouts or challenges, optional difficulty modifiers transforming gameplay, achievement-hunting requiring specific playstyles, or speed-running routes rewarding mastery, and assessing whether accessibility considerations accommodate varied player needs through difficulty options, colorblind modes, subtitle support, alternate control schemes, or assistive features that preserve challenge intent while removing physical barriers.

**5. User Experience & Interface Readiness** — Evaluating whether UI philosophy serves player needs through diegetic interfaces that maintain immersion by integrating information into game world, spatial UI that positions elements in 3D space around player character, meta interfaces that acknowledge game artificiality for clarity, or minimalist approaches that remove clutter to emphasize core gameplay depending on genre expectations and player focus requirements, examining whether HUD design communicates critical information without overwhelming through appropriate information hierarchy that emphasizes urgent data, visual clarity that remains readable across lighting conditions and screen sizes, accessibility features supporting colorblind players and vision difficulties, customization options allowing player preference for element positions and visibility, feedback systems confirming player actions through visual and audio responses, and adaptive elements that appear contextually when relevant rather than constantly cluttering screen space, determining whether menu system architecture enables efficient navigation through logical information grouping, consistent interaction patterns, clear visual hierarchy, appropriate depth preventing both shallow lack of options and overwhelming nested menus, responsive performance avoiding loading delays that interrupt flow, and platform optimization leveraging controller, mouse, touch, or motion controls appropriately, assessing whether player onboarding introduces systems gradually through integrated tutorials teaching through play rather than text walls, contextual help appearing when relevant mechanics become available, difficulty curves starting accessible before escalating, skippable tutorials for experienced players returning or replaying, and retention of tutorial information through quick reference menus, verifying whether error prevention and recovery protects player investment through save systems preventing progress loss, undo options for destructive actions, confirmation prompts for major decisions, clear feedback about action consequences before commitment, and forgiving design that allows experimentation without catastrophic failure, examining whether accessibility features accommodate diverse player needs through control remapping, difficulty options, colorblind modes, subtitle customization, visual and audio cues redundancy, one-handed play support, and assistive technologies integration, determining whether feedback loops confirm player actions through immediate visual responses, satisfying audio cues, haptic feedback where available, animation follow-through, and clear state changes that prevent confusion about whether inputs registered, and assessing whether loading and performance considerations maintain player flow through short loading times, seamless transitions, background loading during gameplay, meaningful loading screens when unavoidable, and performance optimization preventing framerate disruptions that break immersion or harm gameplay responsiveness.

**6. Production & Market Readiness** — Assessing whether technical feasibility analysis identifies realistic scope through platform capability assessment, performance target achievability given visual ambition, asset production pipeline efficiency, third-party middleware integration complexity, networking infrastructure requirements for multiplayer features, and development tool maturity enabling team productivity, examining whether team capability inventory maps required disciplines to available resources including design specializations (systems, level, narrative, UI/UX), art requirements (concept, 3D modeling, animation, VFX, technical art), engineering needs (gameplay, engine, tools, networking, platform), audio demands (music composition, sound design, voice direction, implementation), and production management for scheduling and quality assurance, determining whether development timeline accounts for pre-production design refinement, production ramp-up as team grows, alpha milestone content-complete stage, beta polishing and optimization phase, certification requirements for console platforms, localization for target markets, and post-launch support for patches and updates with realistic buffer for inevitable scope adjustments, evaluating whether monetization model aligns with player expectations through appropriate choice of premium purchase, free-to-play with ethical monetization, subscription service for ongoing content, expansion DLC providing meaningful value, cosmetic-only microtransactions preserving gameplay fairness, or ad-supported models for casual audiences, verifying whether competitive positioning demonstrates market understanding through differentiation from direct competitors, identification of target player segments, realistic sales projections based on comparable titles, marketing strategy for building awareness, community building approach for retention, influencer strategies for reach, and platform choice optimization for target audience habits, examining whether post-launch strategy plans ongoing player engagement through content roadmap extending gameplay life, live operations for service games, seasonal events maintaining interest, community feedback integration demonstrating responsiveness, esports support if competitive focus, modding tools for community creativity, and cross-platform expansion if initial success warrants, determining whether quality assurance strategy ensures polish through playtesting methodology validating fun factor, bug tracking systems preventing quality degradation, balance tuning for competitive fairness, performance optimization across target hardware, accessibility testing with diverse players, and certification preparation for platform requirements, and assessing whether risk mitigation identifies potential challenges including technical risks from ambitious features, market risks from competition or trend shifts, team risks from key personnel dependencies, financial risks from budget overruns, and schedule risks from optimistic estimates with contingency plans for each critical threat vector.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Indie Studio — First Commercial Game Design

**Context:** A three-person indie team (designer, programmer, artist) is assessing their first commercial game design — a 2D roguelike platformer titled "Chrono Chambers" targeting PC via Steam. They have a prototype demonstrating core movement and combat but need to validate design completeness before seeking publisher funding.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 2.6/5.0** (Design Development stage)
- **Core Design Vision: 3.2/5.0** — Strong foundation with clear gameplay loop (time-manipulation platforming + combat), compelling player fantasy (mastering temporal powers), and defensible USP (reversible death mechanic where dying rewinds time but leaves "ghost" obstacles). Emotional goals align well with roguelike mastery fantasy. Weakness: visual style direction inconsistent between concept art pieces, comparable game analysis too narrow (only examined Celeste and Hades, missing relevant time-manipulation games like Braid or Superhot).

- **Narrative & World-Building: 1.9/5.0** — Minimal development. High-concept premise exists (time-manipulating thief infiltrating a reality-shifting tower) but lacks protagonist motivation depth, supporting character plans, environmental storytelling strategy, or lore integration into gameplay. Story delivery mechanism undefined — team debating between minimalist approach (like Downwell) vs narrative focus (like Hades). Critical gap blocking art direction decisions.

- **Mechanics & Systems: 3.8/5.0** — Strongest dimension. Core time-rewind mechanic demonstrably fun in prototype playtesting. Three primary abilities (Rewind, Slow-Motion, Future-Echo) interact synergistically creating emergent puzzle solutions. Progression system well-designed with meta-progression (permanent upgrades) and run-based progression (temporary power-ups) balancing short-term and long-term goals. Secondary mechanics (shop system, NPC interactions) appropriately support core loop without distraction. Minor weakness: late-game difficulty curve potentially too steep based on designer playthroughs (not yet validated with external players at appropriate skill levels).

- **Level & Environment Design: 2.4/5.0** — Philosophy clear (procedurally-generated rooms with hand-crafted challenge templates), but only 8 room templates exist vs 50+ needed for launch variety. Pacing strategy well-conceived (alternating combat/puzzle rooms, shops every 5 rooms, bosses every 15 rooms) but not tested with full content. Environmental storytelling strategy undefined. Replayability factors strong due to roguelike structure, but daily challenge mode and seeded runs not yet designed.

- **User Experience & Interface: 2.9/5.0** — UI philosophy established (minimalist spatial UI showing time-manipulation charges near player character, diegetic health bar as visual character damage). HUD design rough but functional. Menu systems incomplete (no settings menu, pause lacks proper options, death screen basic). Critical gap: no accessibility features planned despite fast-paced gameplay potentially challenging for players with reaction time limitations. Controller support designed but not implemented.

- **Production & Market Readiness: 2.1/5.0** — Technical feasibility high (Unity 2D project running smoothly, all mechanics prototyped). Team capability gap: no experience shipping commercial games, marketing knowledge minimal, business development unfamiliar. Timeline overly optimistic (6-month estimate should be 12-15 months based on content scope). Monetization model defined (premium $19.99 purchase with post-launch cosmetic DLC). Competitive analysis insufficient (missing recent roguelike releases, pricing strategy not validated against comparable indie titles). No community-building strategy or wishlist-building plan despite being 6+ months from launch.

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **Narrative Direction Undefined** (Impact: High, Urgency: Critical) — Story ambiguity blocking art direction, environmental design, and UI tone decisions. Team split between minimalist and narrative-rich approaches. **Action Required:** 2-week narrative sprint to decide approach, create 1-page story summary, define 3 core characters, establish environmental storytelling pillars. If narrative-rich chosen, requires hiring contract writer or significantly extending timeline. Decision blocks 30% of asset production pipeline.

2. **Content Production Underestimated** (Impact: Critical, Urgency: High) — Only 8 room templates exist vs 50+ needed. At current 3-days-per-room pace, requires 126 additional days (6 months of solo artist work), not accounting for enemy variety, boss designs, environmental art sets, VFX, and UI assets. **Action Required:** Implement procedural variation systems to multiply template value, simplify art style to accelerate production (currently detailed pixel art), or extend timeline to 15+ months. Consider contracting additional pixel artist for 3-month sprint.

3. **External Playtesting Absent** (Impact: High, Urgency: Medium) — All difficulty tuning and fun validation based solely on designer's 200+ hours playing own game, creating expertise bias. No data on onboarding clarity, difficulty curve appropriateness, or core mechanic fun for fresh players. **Action Required:** Recruit 10-15 playtesters across skill levels for structured playtesting sessions. Implement telemetry system tracking death locations, ability usage frequency, room completion times, and run length distribution. Schedule bi-weekly playtests for remaining development.

4. **Monetization & Marketing Strategy Immature** (Impact: High, Urgency: Medium) — $19.99 pricing not validated against market data (recent successful indie roguelikes range from $14.99-$24.99), no wishlist-building strategy despite being critical for Steam algorithm visibility, zero social media presence or community building, and post-launch DLC plans vague. **Action Required:** Competitive pricing analysis of 20 comparable titles released 2023-2025, establish Steam page 6 months before launch to build wishlists, create dev blog documenting progress for community engagement, define 3 specific DLC concepts with development cost estimates.

5. **Accessibility Features Absent** (Impact: Medium, Urgency: Medium) — Fast-paced time-manipulation gameplay potentially excludes players with slower reaction times, no assist mode or difficulty modifiers planned, colorblind considerations not addressed (time powers use color coding: blue=rewind, red=slowmo, green=future-echo). **Action Required:** Design assist mode with gameplay speed adjustment (50%-150% speed), invincibility toggle, ability cooldown modifiers, and damage multipliers. Implement colorblind modes and add icon shapes to color-coded abilities. Consider these accessibility features as potential differentiators in marketing.

**Recommended Action Plan** (12-Month Timeline to Production-Ready):

*Months 1-2: Design Completion Sprint*
- Week 1-2: Narrative direction decision, 1-page story doc, environmental storytelling pillars
- Week 3-4: Content production system overhaul (procedural variations, art simplification decision)
- Week 5-6: Accessibility features design, assist mode specification
- Week 7-8: External playtest recruiting, telemetry system implementation, first playtest sessions

*Months 3-4: Content Production Ramp-Up*
- Expand room templates from 8 to 30 (minimum viable variety)
- Create 5 boss encounter designs
- Implement procedural variation systems
- Bi-weekly playtesting with difficulty tuning

*Months 5-6: Polish & Secondary Systems*
- Complete UI/menu systems (settings, pause, accessibility options)
- Implement controller support
- Add meta-progression content (permanent upgrades, unlocks)
- Continue playtesting and balance iteration

*Months 7-9: Vertical Slice & Publisher Pitch*
- Complete 30-minute polished vertical slice (first 3 biomes fully playable)
- Create pitch deck and gameplay trailer
- Establish Steam page and begin wishlist building
- Pitch to 10+ indie publishers for potential funding/marketing support

*Months 10-12: Full Production (if funded) or Continued Development (if bootstrapping)*
- Expand to full 50+ room templates, all bosses, complete progression systems
- Ongoing playtesting and polish
- Community building via dev blog, social media, demo releases
- Prepare for Early Access or full launch

**Success Metrics:**
- Core Design Vision: 3.2 → 4.0 (refine visual style consistency, expand comparable game analysis)
- Narrative & World-Building: 1.9 → 3.0 minimum (decide approach, create essential story docs)
- Mechanics & Systems: 3.8 → 4.2 (validate difficulty curve with external players, fine-tune balance)
- Level & Environment Design: 2.4 → 3.5 (expand to 50+ templates, implement procedural variations)
- User Experience & Interface: 2.9 → 3.8 (complete menu systems, add accessibility features, implement controller support)
- Production & Market Readiness: 2.1 → 3.5 (realistic timeline, validated pricing, community building started, publisher relationships established)
- **Target Overall: 2.6 → 3.5+** (production-ready for full development commitment)

### Example 2: AA Studio — Live Service Game Expansion Assessment

**Context:** A 40-person AA studio operates "Wasteland Warlords," a moderately successful (50K DAU) free-to-play multiplayer survival game. After 18 months live, they're assessing design readiness for their first major expansion "Frozen Frontier" — adding snow biome, new faction, cold survival mechanics, and 20-hour story campaign. Expansion aims to re-engage lapsed players and attract new audiences, with 8-month development timeline and $1.2M budget.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 3.4/5.0** (Production-Ready with caveats)
- **Core Design Vision: 4.1/5.0** — Well-defined expansion scope with clear player fantasy (conquering harsh frozen wasteland), compelling gameplay additions (cold survival mechanics adding strategic depth without overwhelming base game players), and defensible USP (story campaign addressing #1 community request for 18 months). Emotional goals align with existing player base while expanding appeal to narrative-focused survival gamers. Weakness: expansion scope potentially over-ambitious given timeline (team historically delivers 60% slower than initial estimates), and cold mechanics risk alienating tropical biome players who prefer base game systems.

- **Narrative & World-Building: 3.6/5.0** — Solid foundation. Story campaign structure follows proven 3-act format with branching paths (aligned with base game's faction system), protagonist and antagonist well-conceived with clear motivations connecting to existing lore, supporting characters designed to provide faction depth, and environmental storytelling strategy leverages base game's successful "environmental narrative" approach. Weakness: 20-hour campaign length not validated with actual content production (current estimate based on theoretical mission count, not playtested content), and narrative integration with live service seasonal content creates potential continuity conflicts if players experience story out of intended order.

- **Mechanics & Systems: 3.8/5.0** — Cold survival mechanics thoroughly designed (temperature management, hypothermia stages, cold resistance gear, warming mechanics) with clear integration into existing survival systems without invalidating base game strategies. New faction mechanics (ice magic abilities, cold-adapted tech) synergize with existing factions while maintaining competitive balance. Progression system extends existing level cap and adds new skill trees without forcing respec of existing characters. Weakness: balance implications for PvP not fully modeled (cold mechanics potentially advantaging expansion owners in neutral-climate zones), and new crafting materials risk economy inflation without careful tuning.

- **Level & Environment Design: 3.2/5.0** — Snow biome spatial design philosophy consistent with base game's "exploration-rewarding open world" approach, size appropriately scoped (3 zones matching base game's biome scale), pacing strategy alternates combat outposts with story locations, and environmental storytelling embeds lore through abandoned research stations. Weakness: only 1 of 3 zones has detailed design documentation, environmental hazards (avalanches, blizzards, ice crevasses) exist as concepts without implementation specifications, and points of interest density not yet validated against travel time (risk of "empty frozen wasteland" feeling).

- **User Experience & Interface: 3.9/5.0** — UI additions minimal and well-integrated (temperature indicator added to existing HUD, cold resistance displayed in gear tooltips, new quest tracker for campaign follows existing format). Menu systems extended cleanly (new skill trees added to existing character menu, faction reputation screen expanded). Accessibility maintained through existing systems. Weakness: no UI updates to improve base game's existing accessibility limitations (colorblind mode adequate but not excellent, subtitle support exists but no speaker labels), and new mechanics tutorial integration not designed (risk of overwhelming returning players with information dumps).

- **Production & Market Readiness: 2.9/5.0** — Technical feasibility high (snow biome rendering tech prototyped successfully, server infrastructure scales for expected player return, no new third-party dependencies). Team capability strong on art and design but engineering resource constrained (only 6 engineers, 2 dedicated to live ops, leaving 4 for expansion development vs 8 estimated needed). Timeline aggressive but theoretically achievable if scope protected rigorously. Monetization model clear (expansion sold as $19.99 DLC with included cosmetic bundle, free base game updates alongside to maintain player goodwill). **Critical weakness:** competitive positioning analysis insufficient — competing survival games (Rust, ARK, Valheim) all launched major expansions in past 6 months, and "Frozen Frontier" marketing strategy not differentiated beyond "our game but cold," risking player perception as derivative.

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **Engineering Resource Bottleneck** (Impact: Critical, Urgency: Critical) — 4 available engineers vs 8 required for 8-month timeline. Cold mechanics require simulation systems (temperature propagation, clothing insulation calculations, weather systems), campaign requires dialog/cutscene tech (doesn't exist in multiplayer-focused base game), and ongoing live service obligations consume 2 engineers full-time. **Action Required:** (Option A) Extend timeline to 12 months, accepting 4-month revenue delay and competitive risks, (Option B) Contract 3-4 additional engineers for 8-month term, costing $400K beyond budget, (Option C) Descope cold mechanics to simpler implementation, reducing USP strength but protecting timeline. Requires executive decision within 2 weeks.

2. **Campaign Content Production Not Validated** (Impact: High, Urgency: High) — 20-hour estimate based on theoretical mission count (40 missions @ 30min each) but zero missions actually built and playtested. Historical data shows mission implementation takes 3x longer than estimated, and 20 hours would require 40% of total expansion budget. **Action Required:** Build and playtest 3 representative missions within 4 weeks to validate production time, content quality, and fun factor. If validation shows 3x historical underestimate, either descope to 10-hour campaign (still meaningful vs base game's zero story content) or extend timeline. Cannot commit to 20-hour length without validation data.

3. **PvP Balance Implications Unmodeled** (Impact: High, Urgency: Medium) — Cold mechanics giving potential advantages to expansion owners in PvP encounters (cold damage abilities, temperature-resistant gear providing defensive stats, crafting material advantages). Base game maintains player goodwill through "cosmetic-only" monetization, and expansion introducing "pay-for-power" perceptions would severely damage retention. **Action Required:** Commission dedicated systems designer to model PvP scenarios across all biome types, implement stat normalization for cross-biome combat, or design separate PvP modes for expansion vs base game players. Balance testing must occur in months 4-5 before beta, requiring design work in months 2-3.

4. **Marketing Differentiation Weak** (Impact: High, Urgency: Medium) — Positioning as "cold survival mechanics + story campaign" doesn't differentiate from recent competitor expansions (Rust added arctic biome in 2024, ARK has extensive snow areas, The Long Dark owns pure cold survival space). Community excitement moderate but not exceptional based on announcement reactions. **Action Required:** Identify and amplify unique hooks — likely candidates are (A) story campaign quality if execution excellent, (B) faction integration depth if leveraged well, or (C) live service integration creating persistent world changes. Requires marketing strategy overhaul in month 2, potentially trailer re-cut emphasizing unique elements, and community engagement campaign showcasing differentiation.

5. **Onboarding for Returning Players Undefined** (Impact: Medium, Urgency: Medium) — Expansion targets lapsed players (40% of marketing budget allocated to re-engagement), but players who left 6-12 months ago face combined challenge of relearning base game changes + learning expansion mechanics. No onboarding flow designed, and tutorial approach undefined. Risk: players returning for expansion leave again within first session due to overwhelm. **Action Required:** Design "returning player" onboarding flow detecting inactive accounts, providing recap of major changes, optional tutorial refresher for base mechanics, and gradual cold mechanics introduction. Implement as month 3-4 priority after core systems prototyped.

**Recommended Action Plan** (8-Month Timeline + Pre-Planning):

*Pre-Month 1: Critical Decisions (2 weeks)*
- Engineering resource decision (extend timeline, hire contractors, or descope mechanics)
- Campaign length validation sprint (build 3 test missions, playtest, extrapolate real production cost)
- Finalize budget and timeline based on above decisions

*Months 1-2: Foundation & Validation*
- Complete detailed design docs for all 3 snow biome zones (not just 1)
- Prototype cold mechanics in base game environment for testing
- Systems designer models PvP balance scenarios, proposes normalization approach
- Build and playtest 5 campaign missions, validate production pipeline
- Marketing strategy overhaul identifying differentiation hooks

*Months 3-4: Core Production*
- Snow biome zone 1 production (art, layout, encounters, POIs)
- Cold mechanics full implementation and internal testing
- Campaign missions 1-15 production
- PvP balance implementation and testing
- Returning player onboarding flow design

*Months 5-6: Expansion & Iteration*
- Snow biome zones 2-3 production
- Campaign missions 16-25 (adjusted total based on validated length)
- Closed beta with 500 community members (mix of active and lapsed players)
- Balance tuning based on beta feedback
- Marketing campaign launch (trailers, influencer partnerships)

*Months 7-8: Polish & Launch Prep*
- Bug fixing and optimization
- Public beta with 5,000 players (stress test servers, final balance pass)
- Launch event design (in-game celebration, promotional period)
- Post-launch content roadmap finalization (seasons 1-3 planned)
- Live ops team handoff documentation

**Success Metrics:**
- Core Design Vision: 4.1 → 4.3 (validate scope achievability, confirm player fantasy resonates via beta feedback)
- Narrative & World-Building: 3.6 → 4.0 (validate campaign length realistic, playtest narrative quality, resolve seasonal content integration)
- Mechanics & Systems: 3.8 → 4.2 (model and solve PvP balance, validate cold mechanics fun factor, tune economy impact)
- Level & Environment Design: 3.2 → 3.8 (complete detailed docs for all 3 zones, validate POI density via playtesting)
- User Experience & Interface: 3.9 → 4.1 (implement returning player onboarding, maintain accessibility standards)
- Production & Market Readiness: 2.9 → 3.6 (resolve engineering resources, validate timeline, strengthen marketing differentiation)
- **Target Overall: 3.4 → 4.0** (polished, production-quality expansion ready for launch)

**Post-Launch KPIs to Monitor:**
- DAU increase from 50K baseline (target: 80K week 1, sustained 65K after 30 days)
- Lapsed player return rate (target: 15% of players inactive 3+ months)
- Expansion conversion rate (target: 35% of active players purchase within 30 days)
- Campaign completion rate (target: 60% of expansion buyers complete story)
- Player retention curves (target: expansion buyers show +20% better 30-day retention vs base game)
- Review scores (target: 80+ Metacritic user score, 4.0+ Steam rating maintained)

### Example 3: AAA Studio — New IP Greenlight Decision

**Context:** A 150-person AAA studio (owned by major publisher) completed 18-month pre-production on new IP "Echoes of Eternity" — a narrative-driven sci-fi action-adventure combining third-person combat with branching story consequences. Publisher requires comprehensive design readiness assessment before greenlighting $50M+ production budget and 3-year development timeline. Studio's previous titles were linear single-player games; this represents ambitious shift toward player-driven narrative and live service elements.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 3.7/5.0** (Production-Ready with notable risks)
- **Core Design Vision: 4.5/5.0** — Exceptional clarity. Gameplay loop precisely defined (exploration → discovery → consequence → evolution), player fantasy compelling (shaping civilization's future through temporal echoes), USP defensible (consequences rippling across timeline creating visible world changes), and emotional goals powerfully articulated (weight of responsibility, hope through adversity). Visual style stunning (concept art phase complete, art bible comprehensive). Comparable game analysis thorough (studied Mass Effect branching narratives, God of War combat feel, Control's environmental storytelling, Disco Elysium's consequence design). Weakness: combat feel still being refined across multiple prototypes without convergence on "this is definitely fun" consensus among playtesters.

- **Narrative & World-Building: 4.8/5.0** — Studio's traditional strength delivering here. Story structure ambitious but well-architected (5 acts across 30-hour main path, branching into 120+ permutations from major choices), protagonist and supporting cast deeply developed (400+ pages of character bibles), antagonist complex and thematically rich, world lore extensive (500-year timeline documented with cultural/technological evolution), environmental storytelling strategy meticulous (every major location has layered narrative embedded in design). Story delivery balanced across cutscenes (cinematic quality, full performance capture planned), in-game dialogue (robust conversation system with 40+ hours of optional conversations), and environmental discovery. Minor weakness: branching complexity creating production risk (estimated 200,000+ words of dialogue, multiple endings requiring unique assets, QA complexity potentially underestimated).

- **Mechanics & Systems: 3.5/5.0** — Solid but uneven. Consequence system sophisticated (tracking 150+ narrative variables affecting world state, relationships, available missions, endings), progression system elegant (skill trees reflecting moral alignment emerging from player choices rather than explicit good/evil meters), and resource management tight (limited resources forcing meaningful choices rather than completionist hoarding). **Significant weakness:** combat system in flux after 18 months. Three prototypes tested (A: Souls-like deliberate combat, B: God of War cinematic brawler, C: Control-like gunplay + powers), playtest feedback split with no clear winner, and combat designer turnover during pre-production creating design direction instability. Publisher flagging this as primary greenlight blocker.

- **Level & Environment Design: 4.0/5.0** — Strong work. Design philosophy clear (hub-based structure with 8 major regions, each transforming based on player choices), pacing strategy sophisticated (each act alternates between intimate character moments and large-scale action setpieces), player guidance respects intelligence (environmental breadcrumbs rather than waypoint markers, optional assist mode for accessibility), and challenge curve mapped across 30-hour critical path. Environmental storytelling deeply integrated (every location reflects consequence accumulation — help faction A and their settlements thrive visibly, betray faction B and their ruins show neglect). Replayability strong (multiple paths require 3+ playthroughs to experience full content). Weakness: only 2 of 8 regions have detailed level designs beyond concept phase, and temporal transformation systems (showing before/after states based on player actions) represent significant technical risk requiring engine R&D.

- **User Experience & Interface: 3.9/5.0** — Thoughtful design. UI philosophy diegetic where possible (player's wrist device displays health/resources in-world), HUD minimal to preserve cinematic presentation, menu systems elegant (radial menus for console, customizable layouts for PC), and accessibility comprehensive (full subtitle customization, colorblind modes, difficulty modifiers, control remapping, audio cues redundancy). Tutorial approach smart (integrated across first 90 minutes rather than explicit tutorial section). Weakness: branching narrative complexity not reflected in journal/quest tracking UI (current design inadequate for helping players understand consequences of choices or tracking divergent story states), and conversation system UI still using placeholder programmer art after 18 months.

- **Production & Market Readiness: 2.8/5.0** — Mixed picture. Technical feasibility validated through extensive R&D (temporal transformation system prototyped successfully, performance targets achievable on target hardware, proprietary engine enhanced with necessary features), and team capability strong on narrative/art but weaker on combat systems design. **Critical concerns:** (1) Timeline potentially optimistic — 3 years based on linear game experience, but branching narrative complexity and live service ambitions introduce production risks studio hasn't managed at this scale, (2) Monetization model confused — pitched as premium $70 single-player game with "optional" live service elements (seasonal story expansions), but design not cohesive about which content is base game vs post-launch, risking fragmented vision or under-monetization, (3) Competitive positioning strong on paper (narrative depth + player-driven consequences + AAA production values = gap in current market) but dependent on combat quality matching competitors like God of War Ragnarök or Horizon Forbidden West — current combat state wouldn't compete. Publisher competitive analysis shows 18-month launch window has 3 major narrative action-adventures releasing (creating crowded market), and marketing strategy not yet differentiated beyond "choices matter" (which every game claims).

**Critical Greenlight Blockers Identified:**

1. **Combat System Not Production-Ready** (Impact: CRITICAL — Greenlight Blocker, Urgency: CRITICAL) — After 18 months and 3 prototype attempts, no combat foundation validated as "definitively fun" by playtests. Designer turnover created direction instability, and current approach (trying to blend all 3 prototypes) producing "good at nothing" rather than "best-in-class at one thing." Publisher requires demonstrated combat excellence before committing $50M to production. **Action Required:** 8-week "combat convergence sprint" — senior creative director must choose ONE direction (Recommendation: Prototype B's God of War-style brawler aligns best with cinematic narrative focus and target audience expectations), dedicate 10-person strike team to refining exclusively combat feel, conduct weekly playtests with external players (not just team), and achieve minimum 4.0/5.0 "combat fun" rating from 50+ playtesters before greenlight considered. This is publisher's #1 requirement for production approval.

2. **Branching Narrative Production Risk Underestimated** (Impact: CRITICAL, Urgency: HIGH) — 120+ story permutations creating unprecedented production complexity for studio. Estimated 200,000 words dialogue (vs studio's previous largest at 80,000 words), multiple endings requiring unique assets, QA testing paths exponentially complex, and localization costs (supporting 12 languages @ $0.40/word = $960K just for dialogue translation, not counting cinematics). Current budget allocates $8M for narrative production; realistic estimate after studying comparable branching games (Mass Effect, Detroit Become Human) suggests $12-15M required. **Action Required:** Commission external production consultant specializing in branching narrative games (Quantic Dream, Telltale alumni) to audit production plan, identify cost underestimates, and recommend scope adjustments. Likely outcomes: reduce permutations from 120 to 60-80 (still exceptional), implement smarter asset reuse, or increase budget by $4-7M. Decision required before greenlight.

3. **Monetization Model Incoherent** (Impact: HIGH, Urgency: HIGH) — Design team pitched "premium single-player with optional live service," but execution confused. Some designers planning 30-hour complete story in base game (traditional model), others designing story to continue across 4 seasonal expansions (service model), and monetization team planning cosmetics + battle pass (F2P model). Misalignment creating design conflicts (should progression systems account for 2-year player engagement or 30-hour campaign?), and publisher uncertain about revenue projections. **Action Required:** Executive creative decision required: (Option A) Pure premium single-player with traditional expansion DLC (lower long-term revenue but clearer value proposition, fits studio strengths), (Option B) Full live service commitment with episodic story structure (higher revenue potential but requires operational capabilities studio doesn't have), or (Option C) Hybrid "complete base game + optional story seasons" (Mass Effect-style, balance risk but potentially best market fit). Decision impacts design in every dimension and must happen before greenlight.

4. **Timeline Optimism vs Studio Capability** (Impact: HIGH, Urgency: MEDIUM) — 3-year production timeline based on studio's linear game experience, but this project introduces complexities studio hasn't managed: branching narrative production workflows, consequence tracking systems, temporal transformation technical challenges, and potential live service operations. Historical data shows studio delivers 20% slower than initial estimates, and this project's unknowns suggest higher risk. Publisher concerned about timeline slipping to 4-5 years (impacting competitive window and financial projections). **Action Required:** Break production into milestone-based phases with go/no-go decisions: (Phase 1) 6-month "vertical slice" proving combat, consequences, and one complete region at final quality, (Phase 2) 12-month "horizontal expansion" building out all regions at alpha quality, (Phase 3) 12-month "polish & content completion" reaching beta, (Phase 4) 6-month "finalization" for cert and launch. Build 6-month timeline buffer into projections, communicating realistic 3.5-year timeline rather than optimistic 3-year.

5. **Competitive Launch Window Crowded** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: MEDIUM) — Target launch window (Q4 2028 holiday season) currently has 3 announced major narrative action-adventures from competitors, and historical data shows 4+ similar games in same quarter cannibalizes sales (players buy 1-2, wishlist others, never return). Marketing strategy not yet differentiated beyond "choices matter" messaging that every game uses. **Action Required:** (Option A) Shift launch to Q1 2029 sacrificing holiday sales but gaining clearer competitive window, (Option B) Strengthen differentiation positioning around specific consequences mechanic (temporal echoes creating visible world transformation — dramatize this in marketing rather than generic "choices" messaging), or (Option C) Expand target audience beyond core action-adventure fans by emphasizing narrative depth to RPG fans and sci-fi enthusiasts. Marketing strategy overhaul required in months 6-12 of production.

**Publisher Greenlight Recommendation: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

**Conditions for Full Production Greenlight:**
1. **Combat System Validation** (8 weeks) — Achieve 4.0/5.0+ combat fun rating from external playtests, document production-ready combat design
2. **Branching Narrative Production Audit** (6 weeks) — External consultant validates production plan, provides revised budget estimate
3. **Monetization Model Decision** (4 weeks) — Executive alignment on premium vs live service vs hybrid, with design adjustments documented
4. **Vertical Slice Milestone** (6 months) — Deliver one complete region at final quality proving all systems integrated successfully

**Revised Timeline & Budget:**
- Pre-Production Extension: +3 months (resolving blockers 1-3)
- Phase 1 Vertical Slice: 6 months
- Phase 2 Horizontal Expansion: 12 months  
- Phase 3 Polish & Content: 12 months
- Phase 4 Finalization: 6 months
- **Total: 3.5 years from greenlight** (vs original 3-year estimate)
- **Budget: $58M** (vs original $50M estimate) — increased for narrative production complexity and timeline extension

**Success Metrics for Greenlight Conditions:**
- Core Design Vision: 4.5 → 4.7 (finalize combat direction, achieve playtest validation)
- Narrative & World-Building: 4.8 → 4.9 (audit and validate production plan)
- Mechanics & Systems: 3.5 → 4.2 (resolve combat quality, validate consequence systems in vertical slice)
- Level & Environment Design: 4.0 → 4.3 (complete detailed design for all 8 regions, prove temporal transformation in vertical slice)
- User Experience & Interface: 3.9 → 4.2 (enhance journal/quest tracking for branching complexity, finalize conversation UI)
- Production & Market Readiness: 2.8 → 3.8 (realistic timeline, validated budget, coherent monetization, differentiated marketing)
- **Target Overall: 3.7 → 4.3** (industry-leading design ready for AAA production investment)

**Publisher Decision:** Proceed with conditional approval, allocate $2M for 3-month blocker resolution period, schedule greenlight decision review after vertical slice milestone. High confidence in narrative/world-building strength, moderate concern about combat and production risks, requiring validation before full $58M commitment.
