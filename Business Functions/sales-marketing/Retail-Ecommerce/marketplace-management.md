# Marketplace Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage marketplace channels (Amazon, etc.) across listings, operations, pricing, fulfillment, compliance, and performance optimization.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess marketplace management readiness for [BUSINESS] selling on [MARKETPLACES] with goal [REVENUE_TARGET]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Channel strategy & assortment, (2) Listings & content quality, (3) Pricing & promotions, (4) Fulfillment & operations, (5) Compliance & risk, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Channel Strategy & Assortment
- 1 — Initial: Marketplace presence is opportunistic; assortment is unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Strategy and assortment rules defined; guardrails documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Channel strategy is optimized by profitability and brand outcomes.

### 2) Listings & Content Quality
- 1 — Initial: Listings are inconsistent; poor content hurts conversion.
- 3 — Defined: Listing standards, templates, and QA; ownership defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Content quality is monitored; improvements are systematic and measurable.

### 3) Pricing & Promotions
- 1 — Initial: Pricing is reactive; promotions aren’t evaluated consistently.
- 3 — Defined: Pricing rules and promo calendar; margin guardrails.
- 5 — Optimized: Pricing/promo optimization improves contribution margin and conversion.

### 4) Fulfillment & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Operations are manual; stockouts and SLA misses are common.
- 3 — Defined: Operational playbooks; inventory allocation; returns handling.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations scale predictably; exceptions are managed with automation.

### 5) Compliance & Risk
- 1 — Initial: Policy violations and account health issues occur unexpectedly.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance checklist; rights and claims management; escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Risk is monitored proactively; incidents are rare and resolved quickly.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Reporting inconsistent; decisions are not evidence-driven.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined (ACOS/ROAS, conversion, OOS); cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization loops improve performance; learnings are captured and reused.
