# Research Design Overview and Navigation Guide

## Purpose
Guide researchers through the complete research process using focused, stage-specific prompts that cover research question development, literature review, methodology selection, data collection, analysis planning, ethics compliance, and dissemination strategies.

## The Research Design Process

Research is a systematic, staged process. This collection of prompts breaks down the massive task of research design into seven manageable, focused components that can be used individually or sequentially.

### Why Use These Focused Prompts?

**Original Challenge**: The comprehensive research design template was 2,478 lines covering everything from hypothesis formation to publication planning - overwhelming and difficult to navigate.

**Solution**: Seven focused prompts (250-400 lines each) that:
- Target ONE specific stage of the research process
- Are immediately actionable
- Can be used standalone or in sequence
- Focus on essential elements only
- Provide clear, practical guidance

1. **Start with Questions** → `research-question-hypothesis.md`
   - Define your problem and questions first
   - Establishes foundation for all subsequent decisions

2. **Review the Literature** → `literature-search-review.md`
   - Ground questions in existing evidence
   - Identify gaps and theoretical frameworks

3. **Choose Your Methods** → `research-methodology-design.md`
