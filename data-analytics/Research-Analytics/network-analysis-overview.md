# Network Analysis - Overview and Navigation

## Purpose
Navigate the comprehensive network analysis framework to perform graph analytics, understand relationships, identify communities, analyze social structures, and extract insights from interconnected data using advanced graph theory and network science methods.

## Quick Start

**Want to analyze network data quickly?** Here's how to get started:

### When to Use This Overview
- Analyzing social networks, organizational structures, or relationship data
- Finding influential nodes or key connectors in a network
- Discovering communities or clusters in connected data
- Understanding how information flows through networks
- Tracking how networks evolve over time

### Quick Module Selection
```
Your Network Analysis Goal → Recommended Module:

1. Load and explore network data (edge list, adjacency matrix, GraphML)
   → network-analysis-data-preparation.md (30-60 min)

2. Find most important/influential nodes
   → network-analysis-centrality-community.md (Centrality section, 1-2 hours)

3. Discover groups or communities in the network
   → network-analysis-centrality-community.md (Community section, 2-3 hours)

4. Analyze how connected the network is, find shortest paths
   → network-analysis-paths-temporal.md (Path analysis section, 1-2 hours)

5. Track how the network changes over time
   → network-analysis-paths-temporal.md (Temporal section, 2-4 hours)

6. Create visualizations and dashboards
   → network-analysis-visualization.md
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Prepare your data** - Start with network-analysis-data-preparation.md to load and clean your network
2. **Choose analysis type** - Pick centrality (important nodes), community (clusters), or paths (connectivity)
3. **Visualize results** - Use network-analysis-visualization.md to create graphs and dashboards

**Time to complete**: 1 hour for basic metrics, 1 day for comprehensive network analysis

**Pro tip**: Start with data preparation and basic network statistics (nodes, edges, density), then move to centrality analysis to find key players before diving into advanced features.

### Key Concepts
- **Centrality**: Measures of node importance (degree, betweenness, closeness, PageRank)
- **Community**: Dense subgraph with more internal than external connections
- **Modularity**: Quality measure for community structure (higher is better, >0.4 is good)

- **Diameter**: Longest shortest path in the network
- **Robustness**: Network's ability to maintain connectivity under failures
- **Temporal Network**: Network that changes over time

### Network Science Fundamentals
- **Scale-free networks**: Degree distribution follows power law
- **Small-world networks**: Short average path length, high clustering
- **Assortative mixing**: Tendency of similar nodes to connect
- **Triadic closure**: Tendency of connected nodes' neighbors to connect

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Network too large for exact algorithms
- **Solution**: Use sampling (Module 3), approximations, or filter to subnetwork (Module 1)

**Issue**: Disconnected network causing errors
- **Solution**: Analyze largest component separately or use appropriate measures

**Issue**: Community detection gives inconsistent results
- **Solution**: Compare multiple methods (Module 2), evaluate quality metrics

**Issue**: Temporal snapshots have different node sets
- **Solution**: Use node lifecycle analysis (Module 3) to track changes

**Issue**: Visualization cluttered for large network
- **Solution**: Filter to top nodes, use interactive plots, or create multiple views

### Performance Tips
- Use sampling for networks >10,000 nodes
- Apply approximation methods for diameter and paths
- Filter low-degree nodes for visualization
- Process subnetworks in parallel when possible
- Cache intermediate results for iterative analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Review your network data** - Understand format, size, and attributes
2. **Define your questions** - What do you want to learn from the network?
3. **Select appropriate modules** - Use the decision tree above
