# Research Ethics & Implementation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess readiness to run a responsible, compliant, and executable research study across six dimensions: Ethical Risk & Benefit Clarity, Consent & Participant Protections, Privacy & Data Governance, Cultural/Community Fit, Implementation Plan & Resourcing, and Monitoring, Risk Management & Quality. This framework identifies blockers before you submit to an ethics committee or start fieldwork.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive research ethics and implementation readiness assessment for {STUDY_CONTEXT} at {RISK_LEVEL} risk with {IMPLEMENTATION_SCOPE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. ETHICAL RISK & BENEFIT CLARITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the ethical posture of the study is coherent by assessing whether the study’s purpose justifies the participant burden, risks are identified at the level of actual procedures, and the plan uses the least-risk approach that still answers the research question. Examine whether the risk/benefit narrative matches the implementation reality, whether incentives are proportional and non-coercive, and whether inclusion/exclusion decisions are ethically justified rather than merely convenient.

**2. CONSENT & PARTICIPANT PROTECTIONS READINESS**
Evaluate whether participants can consent meaningfully by assessing readability, comprehension checks where appropriate, voluntariness, and whether withdrawal is practically possible without penalty. Examine whether protections are tailored to vulnerable populations, whether recruitment channels avoid undue influence, and whether there is a plan for distress, complaints, or safety concerns during participation. If waivers or altered consent are contemplated, assess whether justification and alternative safeguards are explicit and defensible.

**3. PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY & DATA GOVERNANCE READINESS**
Evaluate whether privacy commitments are operational by assessing what data will be collected, why each element is necessary, where it will be stored, who can access it, and how identifiers are handled across systems. Examine whether encryption, access controls, audit logs, and retention/disposal timelines are specified, whether re-identification risks are considered (including indirect identifiers), and whether data sharing or publication plans align with what can be consented to and securely supported.

**4. CULTURAL/COMMUNITY FIT & RELATIONAL ETHICS READINESS**
Evaluate whether the study is socially and culturally responsible by assessing whether community norms, historical context, language needs, and power dynamics are considered in design and recruitment. Examine whether engagement is authentic (not performative), whether benefits and outputs are meaningful to participants or communities, and whether roles and expectations are negotiated transparently. For community-based or Indigenous contexts, assess whether governance and data ownership expectations are respected and documented.

**5. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN & RESOURCING READINESS**
Evaluate whether the study can actually be executed by assessing whether the timeline is realistic, the critical path is identified, and staffing and training plans cover the real work (recruitment, scheduling, data collection, follow-up, and documentation). Examine whether tools and access requirements are secured (sites, permissions, devices, software), whether budget assumptions match constraints, and whether recruitment feasibility has evidence (pilot, prior rates, or stakeholder validation) rather than optimism.

**6. MONITORING, RISK MANAGEMENT & QUALITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the study will stay safe and credible under stress by assessing whether monitoring roles and decision rights are explicit, whether adverse event and incident reporting is defined, and whether protocol deviations have triage rules and documentation requirements. Examine whether data quality monitoring exists (completeness, consistency, timeliness), whether there are stop/go gates, and whether contingency plans address predictable failure modes such as low recruitment, staff turnover, site access loss, or policy changes.

## Required Output Format

Structure your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, IRB/ethics submission recommendation (submit / revise-first), top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with each dimension, score (X.X/5), key gap, and required safeguard or action

3. **RISK & SAFEGUARD MATRIX** - Risks mapped to mitigations, owners, and evidence (policy, SOP, training, system control)

4. **ETHICS SUBMISSION PACKET OUTLINE** - What documents you will submit (protocol, consent, recruitment scripts, data plan, instruments)

5. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased plan (prep → pilot → collection → closeout) with milestones, dependencies, and resourcing

6. **MONITORING PLAN** - What you will monitor, thresholds, incident escalation path, and documentation/audit trail expectations

Use this maturity scale:
- **1.0–1.9: Unprepared** (high ethical/operational risk; missing safeguards; not submission-ready)
- **2.0–2.9: Developing** (basic plan exists; gaps likely to trigger ethics committee questions or implementation failure)
- **3.0–3.9: Ready with revisions** (credible plan; targeted fixes needed before submission or launch)
- **4.0–4.9: Launch-ready** (clear safeguards, realistic plan, monitoring in place)
- **5.0: Exemplary** (best-in-class protections, governance, and operational discipline)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{STUDY_CONTEXT}` | What study you’re running (design + topic + setting) | "School-based intervention study evaluating a new SEL curriculum in 8 middle schools" |
| `{RISK_LEVEL}` | Expected ethics review level or risk profile | "exempt" or "expedited" or "full review" |
| `{IMPLEMENTATION_SCOPE}` | Scale and constraints (sites, duration, populations, systems) | "8 sites, 2 semesters, minors, district IT constraints" |

## Usage Example

**Input:**
"{STUDY_CONTEXT}: Mixed-methods study interviewing frontline nurses about burnout with optional follow-up survey"
"{RISK_LEVEL}: expedited"
"{IMPLEMENTATION_SCOPE}: 2 hospitals, rotating shifts, sensitive topics, union and HR constraints"

**Output (abridged):**
- Overall Readiness: **2.6/5.0 (Developing)**
- Recommendation: **REVISE-FIRST** (submit in ~2–3 weeks after safeguards are strengthened)
- Top Risks: confidentiality risk in small units, recruitment channel could create perceived coercion, distress protocol missing for sensitive interviews

Dimension Scorecard:
- Risk/Benefit Clarity: 2.7/5 (tighten procedure-level risk inventory; justify incentives)
- Consent & Protections: 2.4/5 (revise recruitment to avoid manager-mediated invites; add distress escalation)
- Privacy & Governance: 2.3/5 (define storage, access control, retention; add de-identification workflow)
- Cultural/Community Fit: 3.1/5 (add shift-friendly scheduling and language access plan)
- Implementation Plan: 2.9/5 (secure site approvals and scheduling workflow; confirm recruitment rates)
- Monitoring & Quality: 2.5/5 (define incident reporting, QA checks, and stop/go gates)

Two-week readiness sprint:
- Week 1: Draft privacy/data plan, de-identification SOP, and revised recruitment scripts; add distress protocol.
- Week 2: Confirm site approvals, train interviewers, finalize monitoring plan and escalation contacts; run a 2-participant pilot.
