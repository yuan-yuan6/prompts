# Lead Scoring Overview

## Introduction
Lead scoring is a systematic methodology for ranking prospects based on their perceived value to your organization. This overview provides a high-level understanding of the lead scoring system and guides you to specific focused templates for detailed implementation.

## What is Lead Scoring?
Lead scoring assigns numerical values to leads based on:
- Demographic and firmographic data
- Behavioral engagement patterns
- Lead source and channel attribution
- Temporal and frequency factors
- Predictive analytics and AI insights

## Key Components
Our lead scoring system consists of five integrated components:

### 1. Framework & Methodology
Define your scoring approach, ideal customer profile, and strategic foundation.
→ **See**: [lead-scoring-framework.md](lead-scoring-framework.md)

### 2. Scoring Criteria
Establish demographic, firmographic, and behavioral scoring rules.
→ **See**: [lead-scoring-criteria.md](lead-scoring-criteria.md)

### 3. Implementation & Integration
Deploy scoring models, integrate with systems, and configure routing.
→ **See**: [lead-scoring-implementation.md](lead-scoring-implementation.md)

### 4. Automation & Workflows
Automate scoring processes, lead routing, and nurture campaigns.
→ **See**: [lead-scoring-automation.md](lead-scoring-automation.md)

### 5. Optimization & Analytics
Measure performance, optimize models, and ensure continuous improvement.
→ **See**: [lead-scoring-optimization.md](lead-scoring-optimization.md)

## Getting Started
1. **Start with Framework**: Define your ICP and scoring methodology
2. **Build Criteria**: Establish scoring rules for your specific business
3. **Implement System**: Deploy technology and integrate with CRM
4. **Automate Workflows**: Set up routing and nurture campaigns
5. **Optimize Continuously**: Measure, analyze, and improve

## Benefits of Lead Scoring
- Improved sales efficiency and productivity
- Higher conversion rates
- Better alignment between sales and marketing
- Data-driven prioritization
- Reduced sales cycle time
- Enhanced customer targeting

## Common Scoring Models
- **Simple Point-Based**: Assign fixed points to attributes
- **Tiered Scoring**: Different point values by tier
- **Weighted Scoring**: Factors weighted by importance
- **Predictive Scoring**: AI/ML-driven probability models
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of methods

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Framework and strategy development
- **Week 3-4**: Criteria definition and model building
- **Week 5-6**: System implementation and integration
- **Week 7-8**: Automation setup and testing
- **Ongoing**: Optimization and continuous improvement

## Best Practices
1. Start simple and iterate
2. Align sales and marketing on definitions
3. Use historical data to inform models
4. Include negative scoring for disqualifiers
5. Test and validate before full deployment
6. Monitor and adjust regularly
7. Ensure data quality and hygiene
8. Document scoring logic clearly
