## Best Practices

1. **Use PICO framework** - Structure searches around Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome
2. **Consult librarian expertise** - Work with information specialists for search optimization
3. **Document comprehensively** - Record all decisions, dates, and modifications
4. **Balance sensitivity and precision** - Aim for comprehensive yet manageable retrieval
5. **Use controlled vocabulary** - Leverage MeSH terms and database thesauri
6. **Test and refine iteratively** - Pilot searches and adjust based on results
7. **Include grey literature** - Search beyond peer-reviewed journals
8. **Track citations systematically** - Use both forward and backward citation searching
9. **Validate with benchmarks** - Ensure known key studies are retrieved
10. **Plan for updates** - Establish update searches before publication

## Tips for Success

- Start broad and narrow gradually through iterative testing
- Save and document search history at each step
- Use reference management software from the beginning
- Consider database overlap and unique coverage
- Account for terminology changes over time
- Translate searches appropriately for each database's syntax
- Seek peer review of search strategy before execution
- Build in sufficient time for comprehensive searching (typically 4-8 weeks)
- Create search alerts for ongoing monitoring
- Maintain detailed search logs for transparency and reproducibility
