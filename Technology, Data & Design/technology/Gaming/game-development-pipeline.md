## Template

Manage {GAME_TITLE} development for {PLATFORM} with {TEAM_SIZE} team, {BUDGET} budget, {TIMELINE} timeline targeting {QUALITY_TARGET} review score and {LAUNCH_DATE} release.

**PRODUCTION PHASES AND MILESTONES**

Structure development into distinct phases with clear deliverables and gates. Pre-production (20-30% of timeline) validates concept before full investment: concept phase (2-4 weeks) defining game pillars, target audience, competitive differentiation, technical feasibility assessment, art style exploration (mood boards, concept art, style guide establishing visual direction); prototype phase (4-8 weeks) building minimum playable demonstrating core loop (paper prototype first validating mechanics cheaply, digital prototype proving technical viability, playtest sessions 10-20 players weekly validating fun); vertical slice (4-8 weeks) creating polished 15-30 minute experience (representative quality, all systems integrated, demonstrates scope achievability, milestone gate for production greenlight requiring stakeholder approval).

Production phase (50-60% of timeline) creates bulk of content and features. Alpha milestone marks feature complete: all gameplay systems implemented (combat, progression, UI, multiplayer functional), 60% content complete (levels, characters, items in-game but not polished), known bugs documented (critical blockers identified, balance rough but playable), playtest builds distributed externally (focus groups, closed beta 1K-10K players validating systems). Beta milestone marks content complete: 90% content integrated (all levels playable, all characters implemented, story complete), bug fixing focus (no new features except critical UX), performance optimization pass (target frame rates achieved, memory budgets met), localization integration (EFIGS minimum: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, plus CJK for global). Release candidate (RC) builds submitted for certification: zero critical bugs, all platform requirements met, final approval from QA lead and production.

Polish phase (20-30% of timeline) achieves ship quality. Gold master represents final shippable build: all certification requirements passed (Sony TRC, Xbox XR, Nintendo Lotcheck, App Store/Play Store guidelines), day-1 patch prepared (critical fixes discovered post-gold, performance improvements, balance tweaks from final playtests), manufacturing deadline met for physical releases (3-4 weeks before street date for disc pressing). Post-gold support continues: day-1 patch deployed at launch (downloaded before first play), hotfix capability ready (server-side for live-service, client patch for critical issues within 24-48 hours), content update pipeline established for ongoing support.

**ASSET CREATION PIPELINE**

Establish art pipeline from concept through engine integration. 3D modeling workflow: concept art reference (2D designs, turnarounds, callouts), high-poly sculpt in ZBrush (8-50M polygons capturing detail), retopology for game mesh (Maya/Blender creating clean topology), UV mapping (consistent texel density 10.24 px/cm standard, minimal stretching, efficient atlas packing), baking normals/AO/curvature from high-poly to low-poly, final mesh export (FBX format, proper naming conventions, LOD variants). Quality standards: hero characters 15K-50K triangles (player character high-end, distant NPCs low-end), environment props 100-5K triangles based on screen coverage, consistent bone counts for animation compatibility (60-100 bones humanoid standard), LOD0/LOD1/LOD2/LOD3 at 100%/50%/25%/10% triangle counts switching at appropriate distances.

Texture pipeline ensures visual consistency and performance. Creation workflow: Substance Painter for PBR materials (base color, roughness, metallic, normal, ambient occlusion), texture atlasing for props (multiple objects sharing single material reducing draw calls), procedural textures for variation (Substance Designer creating tileable materials). Quality standards: hero assets 4K textures (2048x2048 or 4096x4096), standard assets 2K (1024x1024 or 2048x2048), distant/small props 1K or lower, consistent texel density across scene (measures pixel coverage per world unit). Optimization: mipmaps generated automatically (reducing aliasing, improving cache efficiency), texture streaming for large worlds (loading based on camera proximity), compression formats per platform (BC7 for PC, ASTC for mobile, platform-optimal settings).

Animation pipeline supports gameplay and cinematics. Motion capture workflow: performance capture sessions (body + face simultaneously for cinematics, body-only for gameplay), cleanup in MotionBuilder (noise removal, foot contact fixing, retargeting to game skeleton), polish in Maya (timing adjustments, exaggeration for readability, secondary motion addition). Keyframe animation: hand-animated for stylized games (snappier timing, cartoon principles), blend with mocap for hybrid approach (mocap base, hand-polish for game feel). Integration: animation state machines (idle → walk → run → jump transitions, blend trees for directional movement), root motion versus in-place (root motion for precise movement, in-place for responsive controls), additive layers (breathing, look-at, procedural hit reactions).

Audio pipeline delivers immersive soundscapes. Sound design: recording sessions (Foley for footsteps and interactions, synthesis for sci-fi/fantasy elements, field recording for ambiences), editing in Pro Tools/Reaper (cleaning, layering, sweetening), implementation via middleware (Wwise or FMOD for dynamic mixing, real-time parameter control, spatial audio). Music: adaptive score (horizontal re-sequencing transitioning between states, vertical layering adding intensity, stingers for events), composition (orchestral recording for AAA, synthesized for indie, licensed tracks for specific genres), implementation (music states triggered by gameplay, crossfades between tracks, ducking under dialogue). Voice: casting and recording (professional studio, remote recording with quality control), processing (noise removal, normalization, compression), implementation (dialogue systems with branching, lip-sync generation, localization pipeline for multiple languages).

**VERSION CONTROL AND BUILD SYSTEMS**

Configure version control for team collaboration and asset safety. Perforce for large binary assets: depot structure (//project/main for primary development, //project/release for stable branches, //project/dev for feature work), workspace mapping (artists sync art folders, programmers sync code, designers sync both), binary file handling (exclusive checkout for large assets preventing conflicts, file locking for critical assets), branching strategy (main stable, feature streams for major work, release branches for certification). Git with LFS for smaller teams: repository structure (assets tracked via LFS, code in standard Git), .gitattributes configuration (*.psd, *.fbx, *.wav tracked by LFS), branching (main protected, feature branches merged via PR, release tags for milestones). Plastic SCM alternative: native large file support, visual merge tools, Unity/Unreal integration.

Implement automated build systems for continuous integration. Build configuration: daily builds (triggered nightly or on commit, all platforms compiled, smoke tests run automatically), build variants (Development for debugging with symbols, Test for QA with logging, Shipping for release optimized), platform targets (PC first for fastest iteration, console builds for milestone submissions, mobile for live-ops games). CI/CD pipeline: Jenkins or TeamCity orchestrating builds (build agents per platform, parallel compilation, artifact storage), automated testing (unit tests run on commit, integration tests on daily build, smoke tests verifying basic functionality), notification system (Slack/email alerts for build failures, dashboard showing build health). Build distribution: internal builds via shared network or cloud storage (daily builds accessible to QA, milestone builds archived for comparison), external builds via secure distribution (TestFlight for iOS, Google Play Internal Testing, Steam beta branches, console partner portals).

Structure project management tracking progress and dependencies. Sprint planning: 2-week sprints (daily standups 15 minutes, sprint planning 2 hours, retrospectives 1 hour), task tracking in Jira/Trello/Notion (user stories broken into tasks, story points for estimation, burndown charts for velocity), milestone alignment (sprints map to major milestones, buffer sprints for integration and polish). Risk management: dependency tracking (critical path identified, blockers escalated immediately, parallel workstreams where possible), scope management (feature backlog prioritized, cut list maintained for crunch prevention, MVP versus nice-to-have clearly defined), contingency planning (10-20% schedule buffer, identified fallback plans for high-risk features).

**QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOLS**

Structure QA testing ensuring ship-quality releases. Testing phases: smoke testing (daily, 30-60 minutes, verifies build boots and basic flow works, blocks broken builds from wider distribution), regression testing (weekly, 4-8 hours, tests previously fixed bugs haven't returned, covers critical path through game), full pass testing (monthly or milestone, 2-5 days, exercises all features and content, systematic coverage of test plan), certification testing (pre-submission, 1-2 weeks, platform-specific requirements verified, TRC/XR/Lotcheck compliance).

Implement bug tracking and triage processes. Bug documentation: clear reproduction steps (numbered sequence to reproduce, expected versus actual behavior, frequency of occurrence), severity classification (Critical: crash/data loss/progression blocker, Major: significant impact but workaround exists, Minor: cosmetic or edge case, Suggestion: improvement idea), priority assignment (P1 fix immediately, P2 fix this sprint, P3 fix before milestone, P4 backlog). Triage meetings: daily during crunch (15-minute standup reviewing new critical bugs), weekly standard (1-hour review of bug backlog, priority adjustments, resource allocation), milestone gates (zero Critical/P1 bugs for alpha, zero Major/P2 for beta, zero shippable bugs for gold).

Execute performance testing validating technical targets. Profiling workflow: CPU profiling (frame time breakdown, hotspot identification, threading analysis), GPU profiling (draw call counts, shader complexity, memory bandwidth), memory profiling (allocation patterns, peak usage, leak detection). Performance targets: frame rate (60fps performance mode, 30fps quality mode, 120fps competitive shooters), frame time consistency (no hitches >33ms, P99 within target budget), memory budget (4-8GB for current-gen consoles, 2-4GB for last-gen, 1-2GB for mobile), load times (<30s initial load, <5s level transitions, instant fast travel using streaming). Automated benchmarks: scripted test sequences (flythrough levels capturing frame times, stress tests with maximum entities, loading time measurement), regression detection (alerts if performance degrades beyond threshold, A/B comparison against baseline builds), platform matrix (test on min-spec hardware, target hardware, and high-end).

**PLATFORM CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**

Navigate certification processes for each platform. Sony PlayStation certification: TRC (Technical Requirements Checklist) compliance (300+ requirements covering save data, trophies, network, accessibility), submission process (4-6 weeks for initial review, faster for updates), common failures (save data handling, error messaging, network disconnection handling), pre-certification testing (Sony-provided compliance test suites, internal TRC review before submission). Microsoft Xbox certification: XR (Xbox Requirements) compliance (similar scope to TRC, Smart Delivery requirements for cross-gen, Xbox Play Anywhere for PC), submission via Partner Center (2-4 weeks typical review), Game Pass considerations (additional requirements for subscription inclusion).

Nintendo Switch certification: Lotcheck process (Nintendo-specific requirements, handheld/docked mode testing, Joy-Con compatibility), longer timelines (4-8 weeks, stricter quality bar), unique requirements (Nintendo Account integration, amiibo support if applicable, save data cloud backup). Mobile app stores: Apple App Store review (1-7 days typical, guidelines covering monetization, privacy, content), Google Play review (1-3 days, policy compliance, Android Vitals metrics), common rejections (unclear monetization, privacy policy issues, guideline edge cases). Cross-platform considerations: simultaneous submissions (coordinate timing for day-1 parity), parity requirements (platform holders expect feature parity), update synchronization (coordinate patches across platforms).

Plan certification timeline and contingency. Submission calendar: initial submission (8-10 weeks before release allowing for rejection cycles), expected feedback (2-4 weeks per submission cycle), contingency submissions (plan for 2-3 cycles, each requiring fixes and retest), gold master deadline (account for manufacturing lead time if physical). Common certification issues: first-party API usage (ensure latest SDK, proper error handling for network/storage), platform feature integration (trophies/achievements, activity cards, rich presence), compliance testing gaps (edge cases in network disconnection, storage full scenarios, controller disconnect handling), content policy (age ratings, regional restrictions, loot box disclosure requirements where applicable).

Deliver production pipeline as:

1. **PRODUCTION SCHEDULE** - Phase breakdown (pre-production/production/polish percentages), milestone definitions, sprint calendar, dependency map, risk register

2. **ASSET STANDARDS** - Modeling specifications (poly budgets, LOD requirements), texture guidelines (resolution, compression), animation requirements, audio specifications

3. **BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE** - Version control configuration (Perforce/Git setup), CI/CD pipeline (build agents, automated tests), distribution system (internal/external delivery)

4. **QA TEST PLAN** - Test case coverage, bug tracking workflow, triage process, performance benchmarks, certification checklist per platform

5. **CERTIFICATION TIMELINE** - Platform submission schedule, requirement compliance matrix, common failure prevention, contingency planning

6. **POST-LAUNCH OPERATIONS** - Day-1 patch plan, hotfix capability, content update cadence, live monitoring dashboards, community feedback loops
