# Customer Engagement Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to run a customer engagement program that improves retention, reduces churn, and increases lifetime value through consistent journey touchpoints, data-driven interventions, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess customer engagement readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with [CUSTOMER_COUNT] customers and current [RETENTION_RATE]% retention / [CHURN_RATE]% churn. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Engagement strategy & segmentation, (2) Journey mapping & touchpoints, (3) Programs & interventions, (4) Data & tooling, (5) Operating model & governance, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, and a 90-day improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Engagement Strategy & Segmentation
- 1 — Initial: Engagement is reactive; segments are broad; objectives are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Clear goals by segment and lifecycle stage; engagement principles documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is continuously tuned by evidence; segment-specific plays are reliable and repeatable.

### 2) Journey Mapping & Touchpoints
- 1 — Initial: Touchpoints are inconsistent; ownership unclear; experience varies by team.
- 3 — Defined: Core journeys mapped; key touchpoints and owners defined; handoffs are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Journeys are operationalized with SLAs; friction points are measured and improved.

### 3) Programs & Interventions
- 1 — Initial: No consistent onboarding, adoption, or at-risk plays; interventions are ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Standard programs (onboarding, adoption, QBRs, renewal) and at-risk playbooks exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Programs are personalized by segment; interventions are triggered by leading indicators.

### 4) Data & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Customer data is fragmented; limited visibility into usage/health; manual reporting.
- 3 — Defined: Customer profile and health signals; CRM/workflows support basic automation.
- 5 — Optimized: Reliable data pipelines; health models are calibrated; tooling supports proactive engagement at scale.

### 5) Operating Model & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Roles and decision rights unclear; engagement work competes with urgent requests.
- 3 — Defined: Clear ownership (CS/CX/Support/Product); governance cadence; escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales; governance is fast; teams are enabled to execute consistently.

### 6) Measurement & Continuous Improvement
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are inconsistent; learnings aren’t captured; improvements are sporadic.
- 3 — Defined: KPI definitions; routine reviews; action tracking; basic experimentation.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement drives iteration; playbooks improve continuously; outcomes are predictable.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence notes and prioritized gap list
- Segmentation and lifecycle engagement strategy
- Journey map with owned touchpoints and SLAs
- Standard playbooks (onboarding, adoption, renewal, at-risk)
- 90-day improvement plan with success metrics

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [CUSTOMER_COUNT]: Number of active customers
- [RETENTION_RATE]: Retention rate (logo or revenue)
- [CHURN_RATE]: Churn rate (logo or revenue)
- [NRR_TARGET]: Net revenue retention target
- [TOUCHPOINTS]: Touchpoints (onboarding, support, CSM, community, product)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: B2B SaaS with high churn in first 90 days
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 2; Journey 2; Programs 2; Data/Tooling 2; Operating Model 3; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: No standardized onboarding; weak health signals; reactive renewal process
- 90-day priorities: Define onboarding + at-risk plays; implement health scoring inputs; establish weekly retention review cadence
