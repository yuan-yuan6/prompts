## Best Practices

1. **Use systematic evidence grading** - Apply GRADE or equivalent framework consistently
2. **Separate evidence quality from recommendations** - Strength depends on multiple factors
3. **Consider values and preferences** - Stakeholder input crucial for recommendations
4. **Address feasibility and equity** - Practical implementation and access considerations
5. **Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly** - Be transparent about evidence limitations
6. **Provide contextualized guidance** - One size doesn't fit all contexts
7. **Link theory to practice** - Connect theoretical insights to actionable implications
8. **Prioritize research gaps** - Not all gaps equally important; focus on high-impact
9. **Engage stakeholders in interpretation** - Multiple perspectives enhance applicability
10. **Plan for knowledge translation** - Consider how findings will reach end-users

## Tips for Success

- Start with clear summary of synthesis findings before analysis
- Use structured frameworks (GRADE, RE-AIM, etc.) for systematic assessment
- Involve diverse stakeholders in developing implications
- Consider implementation science from the start
- Balance scientific rigor with practical relevance
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations with specificity
- Distinguish between strong evidence gaps and interesting questions
- Consider cost-effectiveness and resource implications realistically
- Plan for heterogeneity in practice contexts and populations
- Create visual summaries for stakeholder communication
