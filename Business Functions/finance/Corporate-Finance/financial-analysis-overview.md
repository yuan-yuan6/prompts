# Financial Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to run consistent, decision-grade financial analysis (performance review, benchmarking, forecasting, risk assessment, valuation) across teams and time.

## Quick Prompt
Assess financial analysis readiness for [ORGANIZATION] producing a decision package for [DECISION_TYPE] on [COMPANY/PORTFOLIO]. Evaluate: data availability/quality, methodology standards, benchmarking discipline, scenario/risk rigor, tooling/reproducibility, and governance/storytelling. Score each dimension 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Data Coverage & Quality
- 1: Source financials are incomplete; definitions vary.
- 3: Standard statements exist; reconciliations are periodic.
- 5: Traceable sources, consistent definitions, and documented adjustments.

2) Methods & Standards
- 1: Analysts use inconsistent methods and templates.
- 3: Standard methods exist but exceptions are common.
- 5: Method standards (ratios, drivers, adjustments) are enforced with QA.

3) Benchmarking & Comparables
- 1: Peer sets are informal; benchmarks are anecdotal.
- 3: Benchmarks used for major analyses.
- 5: Peer selection criteria, benchmark sources, and update cadence are defined.

4) Scenario, Risk & Sensitivity
- 1: Single-point view; limited downside analysis.
- 3: Base/bull/bear exists for key decisions.
- 5: Drivers-based scenarios, sensitivities, and risk signposts are standard.

5) Tooling, Reproducibility & Auditability
- 1: Manual spreadsheets; calculations are hard to reproduce.
- 3: Shared workbooks and version control practices exist.
- 5: Reproducible models, clear inputs/outputs, and controlled changes.

6) Governance, Review & Decision Narrative
- 1: No formal review; conclusions vary by author.
- 3: Reviews happen for high-stakes decisions.
- 5: Clear review gates, decision criteria, and consistent storytelling.

## Deliverables
- Analysis brief (question, scope, time horizon, decision criteria)
- Standardized output pack (tables, charts, key ratios, key drivers)
- Assumption and adjustment log (one-time items, normalization)
- Scenario/sensitivity summary with implications
- Recommendations and open questions for decision makers

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent methods and inputs.
- Level 2: Documented — templates exist, enforcement is weak.
- Level 3: Repeatable — common standards used for most decisions.
- Level 4: Managed — driver-based scenarios and QA are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement and feedback loops.

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]
- [DECISION_TYPE] (credit, investment, board reporting, budgeting, M&A)
- [COMPANY/PORTFOLIO]
- [TIME_HORIZON]
- [FINANCIAL_YEARS]
- [PEER_SET]
- [KEY_DRIVERS]
- [KEY_RISKS]

## Example (Condensed)
Decision: credit renewal for a borrower.
- Data: 3 years statements + covenant schedule; adjustments documented.
- Methods: standard ratio set + driver bridge (revenue, margin, working capital).
- Benchmarks: peer medians and historical ranges.
- Scenarios: base, downside demand shock, margin compression.
- Tooling: versioned workbook with input tabs and checks.
- Governance: review checklist + sign-off before committee.
