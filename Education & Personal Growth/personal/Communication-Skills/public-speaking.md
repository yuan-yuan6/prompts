# Public Speaking Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver effective public speeches and presentations across six dimensions: Content Quality, Audience Understanding, Delivery Skills, Confidence Management, Visual/Technical Preparation, and Engagement Strategy. This framework identifies preparation gaps, strengthens presentation impact, and builds speaker confidence.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **public speaking readiness** for **{SPEECH_TYPE}** to **{AUDIENCE}** about **{TOPIC}** (duration: **{DURATION}**). Evaluate across: (1) **Content quality**—is message clear? Structure logical? Evidence compelling? Opening hook strong? (2) **Audience understanding**—do I know their knowledge level, interests, pain points? Is content tailored? (3) **Delivery skills**—voice projection, pacing, body language, eye contact? Rehearsal level? (4) **Confidence management**—are nerves under control? Backup plans for mistakes? Mental preparation? (5) **Visual/technical prep**—are slides clear? Tech tested? Backups ready? (6) **Engagement strategy**—how will I maintain attention? Handle Q&A? Create memorable moments? Provide a readiness scorecard (1-5 per dimension), delivery strategy, rehearsal plan, and success tactics.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid public speaking readiness evaluation.

## Example

### Input
```
SPEECH_TYPE: "Conference keynote presentation"
AUDIENCE: "350 product managers at annual PM Summit (mix of junior to senior, B2B/B2C)"
TOPIC: "Building AI products that users actually trust"
DURATION: "25 minutes including Q&A"
```

### Output
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overall Readiness: 3.3/5 (Prepared)
Delivery Confidence: Moderate—solid content but delivery needs polish

Top 3 Strengths:
1. Highly relevant topic for audience (AI trust is top concern for PMs)
2. Strong personal credibility (3 years leading AI product at recognized company)
3. Clear core message ("Trust isn't a feature, it's a product design philosophy")

Top 3 Gaps:
1. Opening hook is weak (generic stat instead of compelling story)
2. Minimal rehearsal (only 1 walkthrough, no full dress rehearsal)
3. No engagement strategy beyond standard Q&A (risk of audience attention drift)

Recommended Preparation: Add 6 hours (3 full rehearsals, opening rewrite, add one interactive element)

DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding | Priority Actions |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Content Quality | 4.0/5 | Strong structure and evidence but opening/closing need punch | Rewrite opening with customer story; add powerful closing quote |
| Audience Understanding | 3.5/5 | Good grasp of PM concerns but mixed seniority levels not fully addressed | Add "beginner/advanced" signposting for technical sections |
| Delivery Skills | 2.5/5 | Only 1 rehearsal completed; nervous about timing and tech transitions | Complete 3 full rehearsals; practice slide transitions 10x |
| Confidence Management | 3.0/5 | Moderate nerves; worried about live demo failure | Create demo backup (video recording); practice recovery phrases |
| Visual/Technical Prep | 3.5/5 | Slides clean but not tested in venue; live demo risky | Test setup in actual room 1 day before; simplify demo or cut |
| Engagement Strategy | 2.5/5 | Relying on passive listening + Q&A; no interactive elements | Add 1 poll or quick audience question; prepare Q&A prompts |

PRESENTATION STRATEGY

**Opening Approach:** Customer Story (High Impact)
- Replace generic "80% of users don't trust AI" stat with specific customer story
- Example: "Last month, a user emailed our support: 'Your AI is scary good. How do I know it's not manipulating me?' That question haunted me..."
- Why: Personal, relatable, sets up emotional connection before diving into frameworks

**Content Structure:** Problem-Solution with Rule of Three
- Problem: Users don't trust AI products (illustrated with customer stories and data)
- Solution Framework (Three Pillars):
  1. Explainability: Show your AI's reasoning
  2. Control: Give users override power
  3. Consistency: Behave predictably, acknowledge limitations
- Evidence: Case studies from your products + competitor examples

**Delivery Style:** Conversational Expert
- Tone: Approachable but authoritative ("I've been in your shoes...")
- Pace: Moderate with strategic pauses for emphasis
- Movement: Use stage to signal transitions (center for main points, move for stories)
- Energy: Start high energy (hook), vary throughout, end inspirational

**Risk Mitigation:**
1. **Live demo fails:** Have video backup queued on separate device; say "Let me show you the recording so we don't lose time troubleshooting"
2. **Run over time:** Mark "flex content" on notes (3 optional examples you can skip if running late)
3. **No Q&A questions:** Prep 3 "audience questions" to seed: "A question I often get is..."

**REHEARSAL 3 (Day Before, 90 min): Performance Simulation**
- Focus: Tech and full performance
- Method: Present in actual venue if possible, or simulate environment (standing, clicker, audience chairs)
- Check: Tech transitions smooth? Energy level right? Body language confident?
- Adjust: Fix tech issues, practice opening 5x for confidence, run Q&A scenarios

**PRE-SPEECH (Day Of, 15 min): Confidence Boost**
