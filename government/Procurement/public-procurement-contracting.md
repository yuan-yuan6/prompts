# Public Procurement & Contracting

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for managing government procurement, competitive bidding, vendor selection, contract administration, ensuring FAR/state regulations compliance, and achieving best value for taxpayers.

## Quick Start

**Need to manage government procurement?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Procure IT services contract ($5M, 3 years) for state agency. Develop RFP, conduct competitive bidding process, evaluate proposals based on technical merit and cost, negotiate contract terms, ensure FAR compliance, and establish performance monitoring.
```

### When to Use This
- Purchasing goods or services for government
- Managing competitive bidding processes
- Evaluating vendor proposals
- Negotiating and administering contracts
- Ensuring procurement compliance

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Planning & Solicitation** - Needs assessment, RFP development (4-8 weeks)
2. **Evaluation & Award** - Proposal review, vendor selection (6-12 weeks)
3. **Contract Management** - Administration, performance monitoring (contract duration)

**Time to complete**: 3-6 months for award, ongoing management
