# Research Design Suite - Complete Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
The Research Design Suite provides a comprehensive, modular approach to developing rigorous research methodologies across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. This suite breaks down the complex process of research design into five focused sub-prompts, each addressing a critical component of methodological planning. Use this overview to navigate the suite and select the appropriate prompts for your research needs.

## Quick Start

**Want to design a research study quickly?** Here's how to use this suite:

### When to Use This Overview
- Developing dissertation or thesis research methodology
- Writing grant proposals requiring rigorous research design
- Planning academic research projects (quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods)
- Creating research protocols for IRB submission
- Need structured guidance for methodological planning

### Quick Module Selection
```
Your Research Task → Recommended Module:

1. Define research questions and select methodology
   → research-design-foundation.md (Theory, paradigms, design selection, 20-30 min)

2. Plan sampling strategy and data collection
   → research-design-sampling-data.md (Sample size, recruitment, instruments, 30-45 min)

3. Design data analysis plan and ensure validity
   → research-design-analysis-quality.md (Statistical/qualitative analysis, rigor, 30-45 min)

4. Address ethics and project management
   → research-design-ethics-implementation.md (IRB, timeline, budget, risks, 20-30 min)

5. Plan dissemination and impact strategy
   → research-design-impact.md (Publication, presentations, knowledge translation, 15-20 min)
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Start with foundation** - Use research-design-foundation.md to articulate research problem and select methodology
2. **Plan data collection** - Use research-design-sampling-data.md to design sampling and instruments
3. **Design analysis** - Use research-design-analysis-quality.md to plan analytical approach

**Time to complete**: 2-3 hours for core methodology, 1-2 days for comprehensive research protocol

**Pro tip**: For dissertation proposals, use modules 1-3 first (foundation, sampling, analysis), then add ethics/implementation. For grant proposals, use all 5 modules to demonstrate comprehensive planning.

## Integration Across Sub-Prompts

The five sub-prompts are designed to work together seamlessly:

### Variables Flow Through Suite
Many variables (e.g., research field, population, design type) are used across multiple sub-prompts for consistency.

### Cross-References
Each sub-prompt includes references to related sub-prompts in the "related_templates" section.

### Logical Sequence
The sub-prompts follow the natural flow of research design development:
**Theory → Sampling → Analysis → Implementation → Impact**

### Modular Flexibility
Despite integration, each can stand alone when you need focused work on a specific component.

## Tips for Success with the Suite

1. **Don't skip Foundation** - Even if you think you know your design, the Foundation prompt helps articulate and justify choices clearly

2. **Use variables consistently** - Keep your variable definitions (population, setting, etc.) consistent across sub-prompts

3. **Save your outputs** - Create a research design document that compiles outputs from all sub-prompts you use

4. **Iterate as needed** - Research design is rarely linear; revisit earlier sub-prompts as your understanding deepens

5. **Share with advisors** - Generate drafts with these prompts, then refine based on expert feedback

6. **Adapt to your discipline** - Use the customization options to align with your field's conventions

7. **Start early** - Begin with Foundation and Sampling & Data well before you need to collect data

8. **Plan for quality** - Don't treat Analysis & Quality as an afterthought; integrate it early

9. **Think about impact** - Use Impact & Innovation even for small studies to maximize contribution

10. **Document decisions** - Keep notes on why you made specific methodological choices
