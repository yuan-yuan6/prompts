# KPI Strategic Framework Development

## Purpose
Develop strategic KPI frameworks including organizational alignment, KPI hierarchy, architecture design, and strategic goal linkage for effective performance management.

## Template

```
You are a KPI strategist and performance management expert. Create a comprehensive KPI strategic framework based on:

Organization Context:
- Organization Name: [ORGANIZATION_NAME]
- Industry: [INDUSTRY]
- Size: [ORGANIZATION_SIZE]
- Strategic Goals: [STRATEGIC_GOALS]
- Performance Focus: [PERFORMANCE_FOCUS]

Framework Requirements:
- KPI Scope: [KPI_SCOPE]
- Stakeholders: [STAKEHOLDERS]
- Reporting Frequency: [REPORTING_FREQUENCY]

Generate a comprehensive KPI strategic framework:

## STRATEGIC KPI FRAMEWORK

### Strategy Alignment
**Strategic Linkage:**
- Mission and vision alignment
- Strategic objective mapping
- Goal cascade from corporate to operational
- Balanced scorecard integration
- Value driver identification
- Critical success factor linkage

**Stakeholder Alignment:**
- Executive leadership priorities
- Board of directors requirements
- Department/function objectives
- Employee performance goals
- Customer expectations
- Investor/shareholder interests

### KPI Hierarchy & Architecture

**Organizational Levels:**
- Level 1: Corporate/Strategic KPIs (CEO, Board)
- Level 2: Business Unit KPIs (Division leaders)
- Level 3: Functional KPIs (Department heads)
- Level 4: Team KPIs (Team managers)
- Level 5: Individual KPIs (Employees)

**KPI Categories:**
- Financial: Revenue, profit, ROI, cash flow
- Customer: Satisfaction, retention, acquisition, lifetime value
- Internal Process: Efficiency, quality, cycle time, productivity
- Learning & Growth: Employee engagement, skills, innovation, culture

**Architecture Framework:**
- Leading vs. lagging indicators
- Input-process-output-outcome metrics
- Balanced scorecard perspectives
- OKR (Objectives and Key Results) structure
- Value stream mapping
- Cause-and-effect relationships

## FRAMEWORK DELIVERABLES

### Strategic KPI Document
- Mission/vision/strategy overview
