# Digital Transformation Roadmap Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether an organization can create and execute a credible digital transformation roadmap, with clear sequencing, dependencies, resourcing, and adoption planning.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess digital transformation roadmap readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with [EMPLOYEE_COUNT] employees and [BUDGET] budget over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Current state assessment & baseline, (2) Prioritization & sequencing, (3) Resourcing & funding, (4) Delivery execution & adoption, (5) Architecture & data foundations, (6) Governance & metrics. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Current State Assessment & Baseline
- 1 — Initial: Current state is anecdotal; system/process inventory is incomplete; baseline metrics are missing.
- 3 — Defined: Core systems, processes, and pain points documented; baseline measures exist for key outcomes.
- 5 — Optimized: Baseline is quantified; constraints and risks are explicit; assessment is updated as delivery progresses.

### 2) Prioritization & Sequencing
- 1 — Initial: Roadmap is a list of initiatives; dependencies and prerequisites are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Prioritization rubric exists; sequencing accounts for dependencies and value.
- 5 — Optimized: Sequencing is continuously refined with learning; quick wins and foundations are balanced.

### 3) Resourcing & Funding
- 1 — Initial: Capacity is unknown; roadmap is not matched to skills and availability.
- 3 — Defined: Resourcing plan by quarter; funding model and procurement lead times considered.
- 5 — Optimized: Capacity planning is integrated; vendor and internal delivery models are optimized.

### 4) Delivery Execution & Adoption
- 1 — Initial: Delivery method is inconsistent; adoption is not planned; benefits realization is unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Standard delivery cadence; change management workstream; adoption metrics exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Reliable delivery pipelines; adoption and value tracked; feedback loops improve scope and design.

### 5) Architecture & Data Foundations
- 1 — Initial: Architecture decisions are local; integration and data standards are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Target architecture and data standards exist; integration patterns are established.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular architecture and reusable platforms; data products and governance enable scale.

### 6) Governance & Metrics
- 1 — Initial: Decision rights unclear; status reporting is inconsistent; risks are not owned.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence and escalation paths; consistent metrics; risk register maintained.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance accelerates decisions; metrics drive tradeoffs; value realization is transparent.

## Deliverables
- Roadmap readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Prioritization rubric and dependency map
- Resourcing and funding plan aligned to sequencing
- Adoption and benefits tracking approach
- 90-day plan to strengthen roadmap quality

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [EMPLOYEE_COUNT]: Employee count
- [BUDGET]: Transformation budget
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 18 months)
- [TOP_INITIATIVES]: Candidate initiatives
- [BASELINE_METRICS]: Baseline KPIs (cycle time, cost, NPS, uptime)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Manufacturer modernizing ERP and digitizing shop-floor operations
- Scores (1–5): Baseline 2; Sequencing 2; Resourcing 2; Adoption 2; Architecture 3; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Missing dependency map, unclear capacity, weak adoption plan
- 90-day priorities: Complete system/process inventory; define dependency map; align capacity plan; establish adoption KPIs
