# Data Visualization Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your charts, figures, infographics, or visual abstracts are ready to publish or present by scoring six dimensions: Message & Audience Fit, Data & Encoding Fit, Design & Accessibility, Statistical Integrity, Reproducibility & Tooling, and Delivery Constraints. Use this to decide **ready / revise-first** and to generate a focused revision plan.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **data visualization readiness** for **{VIS_CONTEXT}** communicating **{KEY_CLAIM}** using **{DATA_CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension 1–5 with brief evidence: (1) message & audience fit, (2) data & encoding fit, (3) design & accessibility, (4) statistical integrity, (5) reproducibility & tooling, (6) delivery constraints (journal/conference/medium). Provide an overall maturity level, a revise-first checklist, and a prioritized improvement plan.

**Usage:** Replace the curly-brace placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Conduct a data visualization readiness assessment for {VIS_CONTEXT} communicating {KEY_CLAIM} using {DATA_CONSTRAINTS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. MESSAGE & AUDIENCE FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the figure has one clear job by assessing who the audience is, what decision or understanding the figure should produce, and whether the key takeaway is obvious in 3–5 seconds. Confirm the visual matches the medium (paper vs slide vs poster vs web) and the narrative position (hook, evidence, explanation, or summary).

**2. DATA & ENCODING FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the chart type and encodings match the data by assessing scale types, comparators, and whether the chosen representation supports the intended comparison (difference, trend, distribution, relationship). Confirm axes, units, baselines, transformations, and aggregation choices are defensible.

**3. DESIGN & ACCESSIBILITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the figure is legible and inclusive by assessing typography, spacing, contrast, and color usage (including colorblind-safe design and grayscale robustness). Confirm annotations and legends are minimal but sufficient, and that the figure is readable at the expected viewing distance/size.

**4. STATISTICAL INTEGRITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the visual is honest and statistically correct by assessing uncertainty representation (CI/SD/SE), sample sizes, missingness notes, and whether significance markers (if used) are explained and not misleading. Confirm the figure does not overstate causality or precision and includes key assumptions/limitations where necessary.

**5. REPRODUCIBILITY & TOOLING READINESS**
Evaluate whether the figure can be regenerated by assessing whether code/workflow is versioned, the data extract is traceable, and the environment/toolchain is stable. Confirm naming conventions, source-of-truth files, and an audit trail exist for revisions.

**6. DELIVERY CONSTRAINTS READINESS**
Evaluate whether the figure meets real constraints: journal specs (size, font, color), conference slide templates, poster dimensions, export formats (PDF/SVG/PNG/TIFF), and accessibility rules. Confirm you have a backup export and that embedded fonts/rendering are reliable.

## Required Output Format

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, ready/revise-first, top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table: dimension, score (1–5), evidence, biggest gap, highest-impact fix

3. **FIGURE CHECKLIST (TOP 12)** - The exact edits to make next

4. **CAPTION PLAN**
- Opening sentence (key finding)
- What is plotted (variables, units)
- Sample sizes + groups
- Uncertainty + statistical notes
- Abbreviations + caveats

5. **EXPORT PLAN** - Formats, resolution, and where files live

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Initial:** Message unclear; chart choice/labels inconsistent; high risk of misinterpretation.
- **2 — Developing:** Basic visual works; major gaps in accessibility, uncertainty, or caption completeness.
- **3 — Defined:** Coherent and defensible; needs polishing and constraints compliance.
- **4 — Managed:** Clear, accessible, statistically honest; reproducible workflow; publication/presentation ready.
- **5 — Optimized:** Highly effective and reusable visual system; consistent style; fast iteration without regressions.

## Variables (Use Max 3)

| Variable | What to include | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{VIS_CONTEXT}` | Medium + venue + audience + format constraints | “Journal figure (2-column), readers are clinicians” |
| `{KEY_CLAIM}` | One-sentence takeaway the figure must support | “Intervention reduced errors vs control across sites” |
| `{DATA_CONSTRAINTS}` | Data caveats that affect visualization choices | “Skewed distribution, missing follow-up, small n per site” |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- `{VIS_CONTEXT}`: “Poster figure for a hospital symposium, viewed from 6 feet.”
- `{KEY_CLAIM}`: “Checklist adoption reduced reconciliation errors by ~25%.”
- `{DATA_CONSTRAINTS}`: “Nonrandom rollout; site-level clustering; missing weeks.”

**Output (abridged)**
- Executive summary: 3.3/5 (Defined), **revise-first**
- Biggest gaps: uncertainty not shown; chart choice obscures baseline; caption lacks sample sizes
- Next edits: switch to before/after with site faceting; add CI band or bootstrap interval; add n per time window; annotate rollout date; export as PDF + PNG

---

## Best Practices (8)

1. Write the takeaway first; design the figure to make it obvious.
2. Match chart type to the comparison you want readers to make.
3. Label everything needed to interpret without narration.
4. Use color as an accent, not as the only encoding.
5. Always show uncertainty or explain why you can’t.
6. Avoid misleading axes, truncations, or over-aggregation.
7. Make figures reproducible (code + versioned data extract).
8. Test readability at the real size and medium.
