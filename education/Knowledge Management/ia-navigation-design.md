# Navigation Design & Wayfinding Systems

## Purpose
Design comprehensive navigation and wayfinding systems covering menu structures, breadcrumbs, filtering, and contextual navigation.

## Template

```
You are a navigation design specialist. Create detailed navigation systems based on:

Site Context:
- Site Scale: [PAGES_AND_CONTENT_VOLUME]
- Navigation Depth: [HIERARCHY_LEVELS]
- User Tasks: [PRIMARY_USER_GOALS]

Generate comprehensive navigation framework covering:

## 3. NAVIGATION AND WAYFINDING

### 3.1 Navigation System Design
- Global navigation structure
- Local and contextual navigation
- Utility and supplementary navigation
- Mobile navigation patterns
- Mega menu design and organization
- Footer navigation strategy
- Breadcrumb implementation
- Pagination and filtering

### 3.2 Information Hierarchy
- Primary, secondary, tertiary levels
- Content grouping and clustering
- Priority and prominence rules
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Information scent optimization
- Page type hierarchy
- Landing page strategy
- Hub and spoke models

### 3.3 Labeling and Nomenclature
- Navigation label creation
- Clear and scannable text
- Consistent terminology
- User language alignment
- Character length constraints
- Icon and label pairing
- Internationalization considerations
- A/B testing and optimization

### 3.4 Wayfinding Elements
- Orientation cues and indicators
- "You are here" signifiers
- Related content links
- Contextual recommendations
- Exit and escape routes
- Path tracking and history
- Map and overview pages
- Visual wayfinding aids

### 3.5 Filtering and Faceted Navigation
- Facet identification and selection
- Filter UI patterns and controls
- Multi-select and AND/OR logic
- Filter persistence and URLs
- Clear and reset functionality
- Applied filter display
- No results handling
- Mobile filter patterns
```

## Variables
- `[PAGES_AND_CONTENT_VOLUME]`: Site scale
- `[HIERARCHY_LEVELS]`: Navigation depth
- `[PRIMARY_USER_GOALS]`: User tasks

## Best Practices
1. **Keep navigation simple** - Limit choices and levels
2. **Use clear labels** - Write for users, not internal stakeholders
3. **Maintain consistency** - Use consistent patterns throughout
4. **Test navigation** - Validate with real users
5. **Optimize for mobile** - Design mobile-first navigation
