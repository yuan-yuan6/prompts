# Screenwriting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether a screenplay or TV pilot project is ready to move from idea to a draft that can survive feedback, revision, and pitching. This framework evaluates readiness across six dimensions—Concept & Market Positioning, Structure & Story Engine, Character & Theme, Scene Craft & Dialogue, Format & Production Constraints, and Process & Pitch Readiness—so you can identify what to clarify before investing time in pages.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive screenwriting readiness assessment for {PROJECT_CONTEXT} in {FORMAT} targeting {TARGET_AUDIENCE}.

Score each dimension from 1.0 to 5.0. Justify each score with concrete artifacts (logline options, comps list, beat sheet, character one-pagers, sample scenes, tone references, and a realistic plan for feedback and revision).

### 1) Concept & Market Positioning Readiness
Assess whether the project has a clear, pitchable premise by evaluating whether the logline communicates protagonist, goal, obstacle, and stakes in a single sentence, whether the hook is distinct enough to be memorable without requiring explanation, whether genre and tone are consistent and intentional, whether comparable titles (“comps”) clarify audience expectations and positioning, and whether the concept can sustain the chosen format (a feature that can carry 90–110 minutes, or a pilot that can generate multiple episodes).

A strong score implies you can explain what the story is, who it is for, and why it stands out, while being honest about what makes it hard and how you will deliver on the promise.

### 2) Structure & Story Engine Readiness
Evaluate whether the story has an engine that generates forward motion by assessing whether the protagonist’s goal forces repeated decisions and escalating consequences, whether turning points are planned (inciting incident, act breaks, midpoint reversals, climactic confrontation), whether obstacles are varied and increasingly difficult, whether the story’s rules are coherent (especially for mystery, thriller, sci‑fi, fantasy, or high-concept comedy), and whether pacing targets are realistic for the format.

A strong score implies you are not relying on vibes or isolated scenes; the plot is designed to create momentum, tension, and inevitability.

### 3) Character, Theme & Emotional Arc Readiness
Assess whether characters will carry the story by evaluating whether the protagonist has a clear want and deeper need, whether their flaw creates conflict rather than being a label, whether the antagonist or opposing force applies pressure in ways that test the protagonist’s identity, whether key relationships reveal different sides of the protagonist (and evolve under stress), and whether the theme is embedded in choices and consequences rather than stated explicitly.

A strong score implies character decisions drive plot events, emotional beats land because they are earned, and the ending resolves both external and internal journeys.

### 4) Scene Craft, Dialogue & Visual Storytelling Readiness
Evaluate whether the writing can translate into compelling scenes by assessing whether each scene has a purpose (goal, conflict, change), whether visual action and behavior carry meaning without over-explaining, whether dialogue reflects character voice and subtext instead of exposition dumps, whether scene transitions maintain rhythm, and whether set pieces are designed to reveal character and advance stakes rather than existing as standalone spectacle.

A strong score implies you can write pages that read fast, play clearly, and consistently express tone through scene choices, not just through description.

### 5) Format, Production Constraints & Deliverables Readiness
Assess whether the project is aligned to real-world constraints by evaluating whether the format choice is correct (feature, pilot, web series episode length), whether page count expectations are clear, whether budget and production realities are acknowledged early (locations, cast size, stunts/VFX, period elements), whether deliverables are defined for the next milestone (outline, treatment, first draft, pitch deck, series bible), and whether the project’s ambition is matched to the team’s resources and timeline.

A strong score implies the story is designed to be made (or at least credibly packaged), and “constraints” are treated as creative inputs rather than afterthoughts.

### 6) Process, Feedback & Pitch Readiness
Evaluate whether you can finish and improve the script by assessing whether you have a writing plan with timeboxes and checkpoints, whether you know who will give feedback and what kind (story, dialogue, representation, market), whether you can run revisions systematically (diagnose notes, decide changes, re-outline affected sections, rewrite), whether the pitch materials are planned (logline, one-page, comps, tone references, character summaries, season arc for TV), and whether you can present the project clearly without overselling or hiding risks.

A strong score implies you have a repeatable process to go from idea to draft to improved draft, with feedback and pitching built in.

## Required Output Format

Provide:

1) Executive summary with overall readiness (X.X/5.0), maturity stage, top 3 blockers, and the single best next step.

2) Dimension scorecard with short evidence for each score.

3) Top story risks (5–10) with mitigation actions (what to clarify, write, or test).

4) 30/60/90-day writing plan that outputs specific deliverables and review points.

5) Pitch package outline (what the deck/one-pager/bible must include) tailored to the format.

## Maturity Scale

- 1.0–1.9: Exploratory (idea stage; unclear hook, engine, or audience)
- 2.0–2.9: Outlining (promising premise; structure/characters not yet stress-tested)
- 3.0–3.9: Drafting (solid plan and pages; needs revision discipline and feedback loops)
- 4.0–4.9: Market-ready (coherent draft with strong voice; package and pitching prepared)
- 5.0: Production-ready (polished, tested, and packaged; clear path to attachment/financing)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `{PROJECT_CONTEXT}` | What you’re writing and the core premise | "Contained thriller about a paramedic trapped in a high-rise", "Half-hour workplace comedy in a failing mall" |
| `{FORMAT}` | Format and target length | "Feature (95–110 pages)", "TV Pilot (60 pages)", "Half-hour pilot (30–35 pages)" |
| `{TARGET_AUDIENCE}` | Intended audience and positioning | "Adult thriller audience; elevated genre", "Family-friendly streaming", "Young adult dramedy" |

## Usage Example (Single Example)

**Scenario:** {PROJECT_CONTEXT} is a contained thriller feature in which a night-shift security guard discovers a staged emergency that forces them to choose between self-preservation and exposing a powerful conspiracy. The target is a 100-page feature with limited locations and a small cast, positioned for streaming.

**Scores (1–5):** Concept & Market Positioning 3.3, Structure & Story Engine 2.6, Character & Theme 2.8, Scene Craft & Dialogue 2.7, Format & Production Constraints 3.7, Process & Pitch 2.4. Overall readiness: 2.9/5.0 (Outlining).

**Key findings:** The concept is pitchable and budget-aware, but the story engine is not yet proven because the escalation plan relies on coincidences rather than decisions that close off options and raise stakes. Character motivation is plausible but not sharp enough to generate conflict in every sequence, and the antagonist pressure is under-defined. The project is most ready on production constraints, but least ready on process: there is no structured feedback plan, no revision method, and no clear pitch materials beyond a premise.

**30/60/90-day plan:** In days 1–10, produce three logline variants, pick comps, and write a one-page synopsis with explicit stakes and turning points. In days 11–30, build a beat sheet and sequence outline that demonstrates escalation and irreversible choices, then write two key set-piece scenes to validate tone and voice. In days 31–60, complete a full first draft without line-level perfection, then run one story-focused feedback round and re-outline revisions. In days 61–90, deliver a second draft, finalize a one-page, a short deck outline, and a pitch talk-track focused on hook, character drive, and ending.
