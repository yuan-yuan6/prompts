# Comedy Writing Template

## Purpose
Create engaging comedy content including jokes, sketches, and standup material that generates laughter and entertainment across various formats and comedy styles.

## Quick Start

**Get Your First Laugh in 10 Minutes**

1. **Pick Your Truth** (2 min): What frustrates you today? What's absurd about normal life?
2. **Setup + Twist** (5 min): Write 3 jokes using this formula: "You know what's weird about [X]? [Unexpected observation]"
3. **Test It** (3 min): Read aloud to someone or record yourself - if YOU laugh, you're on track

**Joke Starter Kit**:
- Observational: "Why do we [normal thing] when [absurd result]?"
- Character: Give someone an exaggerated trait and put them in a conflict
- Story: "This actually happened..." (then make it ridiculous)

**Pro Tip**: Start with what makes YOU laugh. Authenticity beats perfect technique.

**Next Step**: Use the Joke Writing section to refine your 3 jokes into killer punchlines!
