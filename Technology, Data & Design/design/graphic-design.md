## Template

Design {PROJECT_TYPE} for {CLIENT} targeting {AUDIENCE} expressing {BRAND_PERSONALITY} across {PLATFORMS}.

**PROJECT SCOPING AND BRAND STRATEGY**

Define project scope establishing clear boundaries and deliverables. Logo redesign projects include logo variations (full color, monochrome, reversed), minimum size specifications (0.5" print, 24px digital), clear space guidelines (equal to logo height), file formats (AI, EPS, PNG, SVG). Complete brand identity expands including business card (3.5×2"), letterhead (8.5×11"), presentation template (16:9 PowerPoint), email signature, social media templates (Instagram 1080×1080, LinkedIn 1200×627, Facebook 1200×630). Marketing campaign encompasses specific applications: 3 poster sizes (11×17", 18×24", 24×36"), tri-fold brochure, digital ads (Google Display: 300×250, 728×90, 160×600), social media series (15-20 graphics).

Establish brand personality translating abstract values into visual decisions. Professional trustworthy brands use conservative colors (navy, gray), serif or clean sans-serif fonts, generous whitespace, symmetrical layouts suitable for finance, healthcare, legal services. Energetic friendly brands employ vibrant colors (orange, teal, purple), rounded sans-serifs, dynamic asymmetric layouts, playful illustrations appropriate for consumer products, fitness, children's brands. Technical precise brands feature monochromatic schemes, geometric fonts, grid-based layouts, data visualization aesthetics for software companies, engineering firms.

Conduct competitive analysis identifying visual differentiation opportunities. Audit 5-7 direct competitors documenting color palettes, typography, design styles revealing saturation patterns: financial services dominated by blue-gray suggesting warm earth-tone differentiation maintaining professionalism, tech startups crowded with geometric sans-serifs and gradients enabling friendly hand-drawn or bold serif differentiation. Document gaps and whitespace: if competitors use photography, illustration differentiates; if all use minimalism, strategic complexity stands out.

Set realistic timelines accounting for revision cycles and approval processes. Simple logo design: 2 weeks (discovery 3 days, concepts 4 days, revisions 4 days, finalization 3 days). Complete brand identity: 6-8 weeks (research 1 week, logo 2 weeks, applications 2-3 weeks, guidelines 1 week, revisions throughout). Complex campaign: 8-12 weeks (strategy 2 weeks, concepting 2 weeks, production 4-6 weeks, revisions 2 weeks). Build 30-40% buffer for client feedback delays, revision requests, technical issues.

**COLOR SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT**

Design primary color with strategic rationale and comprehensive specifications. Document emotional associations and competitive positioning: "Primary navy #1A365D chosen over competitors' light blues (#0066FF) communicating deeper trust and sophistication while maintaining financial sector convention, tested at 14.2:1 contrast on white exceeding WCAG AA." Generate tints and shades: 100 (lightest background tint), 300 (subtle backgrounds), 500 (primary brand use), 700 (hover states), 900 (text on light backgrounds).

Specify complete color values enabling consistent reproduction across media. Primary navy: HEX #1A365D, RGB 26/54/93, CMYK 100/75/25/40, Pantone 289 C (coated stock) / 289 U (uncoated). Secondary copper: HEX #B87333, RGB 184/115/51, CMYK 25/55/75/15, Pantone 7573 C. Document accessibility: navy passes WCAG AA on white (14.2:1) but fails on light gray backgrounds (#F0F0F0 = 2.8:1) requiring darker shade navy-700 (#0F1E36) achieving 7.2:1.

Create semantic color system communicating functional states. Success green (#10B981) indicates positive outcomes (form submission, successful save), warning amber (#F59E0B) signals caution (unsaved changes, approaching limits), error red (#EF4444) communicates problems (validation failures, system errors), info blue (#3B82F6 distinct from primary) presents neutral information. Generate 5-shade scales for each semantic color supporting backgrounds, borders, text, solid fills.

Define usage guidelines preventing color chaos and maintaining hierarchy. Primary color maximum 40% page coverage preventing overwhelming, neutral grays 50-60% creating balance, accent colors 10% maximum providing emphasis. Print specification: Rich black uses C:60 M:40 Y:40 K:100 versus flat K:100 achieving depth, light backgrounds stay below 20% total ink coverage preventing show-through. Digital optimization: Test colors on various displays (bright monitors, dim mobile screens), provide dark mode alternatives for accessibility.

**TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM AND HIERARCHY**

Select typeface families balancing brand personality with functional requirements. Primary typeface defines brand character: serif fonts (Playfair Display, Lora, Merriweather) convey tradition and sophistication, geometric sans-serifs (Futura, Montserrat, Poppins) communicate modernity and clarity, humanist sans-serifs (Open Sans, Lato, Source Sans) balance professionalism and approachability. Limit to 2-3 typefaces maximum: primary for brand and headlines, secondary for body copy, optional display for special emphasis.

Define type scale using consistent mathematical ratio creating hierarchical clarity. Use 1.25 ratio (major third) for balanced progression: Display 48-60px (hero headlines), H1 38px (page titles), H2 30px (sections), H3 24px (subsections), H4 19px (minor headings), Body 16px (paragraph text), Small 13px (captions, footnotes). Print scales larger: Body 10-12pt, Headlines 24-72pt accounting for reading distance. Specify weights: Regular 400 (body), Medium 500 (subheads), Semi-bold 600 (emphasis), Bold 700 (headlines).

Specify typographic details ensuring readability and polish. Body text line-height 1.5-1.6 preventing cramped appearance: 16px text with 24-26px line-height. Headlines use tighter 1.1-1.3 line-height emphasizing impact. Increase letter-spacing +50 to +100 units on all-caps text improving legibility, decrease -20 to -50 on large display type achieving optical balance. Limit line length 60-80 characters optimal reading: longer causes eye fatigue, shorter feels choppy.

Create comprehensive typography specifications for implementation. Document font files with licensing: "Inter font family (Google Fonts, SIL Open Font License), include weights 400/500/600/700, character sets Latin Extended A+B supporting 100+ languages." Specify fallback stacks: "font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;" ensuring graceful degradation. Define web font loading: "Use font-display: swap preventing invisible text, subset to Latin characters reducing file size 60%, preload critical fonts improving perceived performance."

**LAYOUT SYSTEMS AND COMPOSITION**

Implement grid systems providing structure while enabling flexibility. 12-column grid divides cleanly: full-width (12 columns), two-column (6-6), three-column (4-4-4), sidebar layout (3-9 or 4-8). Define gutters 20-30px desktop, 16px mobile maintaining breathing room. Magazine/publication layouts use baseline grids aligning text across columns: 6pt baseline with 12pt line-height creating vertical rhythm. Modular grids combine column and row systems: 6×4 module grid enables complex page compositions.

Apply composition principles creating visual interest and balance. Rule of thirds positions focal points at grid intersections (1/3 and 2/3 marks) versus static centering. Golden ratio (1:1.618) creates aesthetically pleasing proportions: 800×494px rectangle, 62% content area 38% sidebar. Visual weight balances elements: large light object counterbalances small dark object, busy section balances whitespace area, text block balances large image.

Design information hierarchy guiding viewer attention through size, position, color, contrast. Primary level uses large size (2-3× body text), bold weight, high contrast commanding attention: headlines, main CTAs, hero imagery. Secondary level supports without competing: medium subheadings (1.5× body), standard weight, moderate contrast. Tertiary level provides detail on demand: body text size, light weight, subtle contrast for captions, footnotes, metadata.

Utilize whitespace strategically preventing cluttered appearance while creating emphasis. Micro whitespace between letters (tracking), lines (leading), and interface elements: generous 40-60px padding around cards, 20-30px between paragraphs improving readability and sophistication. Macro whitespace separates major sections: 80-120px vertical spacing between homepage sections, asymmetric layouts leaving 40-50% canvas empty. Luxury brands maximize whitespace (60-70% empty) creating premium perception, value brands minimize (30-40% empty) maximizing information density.

**PRINT PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS**

Define technical requirements ensuring quality printed output. Resolution 300 DPI minimum for photographs and raster graphics: 8×10" photo requires 2400×3000 pixels avoiding pixelation. Vector graphics (logos, type, icons) scale infinitely maintaining crispness. Bleed extends design 0.125" (3mm) beyond trim on all edges ensuring color reaches edge after cutting variance. Safe area keeps critical content (text, logos) 0.25" (6mm) inside trim preventing accidental cropping.

Specify color modes and profiles for consistent reproduction. CMYK color mode for offset printing: convert RGB files to CMYK before printing preventing unexpected color shifts (vibrant RGB blues dull in CMYK). Pantone spot colors specify exact ink formulas bypassing CMYK variability: Pantone 289 C reproduces identically across printers. Color profiles (ISO Coated v2, GRACoL) calibrate for specific printing conditions. Request printed proof before full run: verify colors, check alignment, catch typos.

Choose paper stocks balancing aesthetics, function, budget. Text weight 60-100# suitable for flyers, letterhead, inserts providing flexibility at $0.02-0.05/sheet. Cover weight 80-130# for business cards, postcards, brochure covers creating substantial feel at $0.08-0.15/sheet. Coatings affect appearance: matte (sophisticated understated), gloss (vibrant colors), uncoated (organic tactile), aqueous (eco-friendly water-based). Specialty stocks (metallic, textured, recycled) differentiate at 2-5× cost premium.

Prepare production-ready files preventing printing errors and delays. Outline fonts converting text to paths preventing font substitution when printer lacks typeface. Package all linked images confirming graphics included at correct resolution and color mode. Export to PDF/X-1a print standard: embeds fonts and images, includes bleed and crop marks, flattens transparency. Include printer's marks: trim marks (cutting guides), bleed marks (bleed boundary), color bars (color calibration), registration marks (alignment).

Deliver graphic design project as:

1. **PRIMARY DESIGN** - Main deliverable in production-ready format with all specifications met

2. **DESIGN VARIATIONS** - 2-3 alternatives exploring different approaches (color, layout, style)

3. **BRAND STYLE GUIDE** - Color palette (HEX/RGB/CMYK/Pantone), typography specs, logo usage rules, spacing standards
