# Course Accessibility & Inclusion Designer

## Purpose
Create an inclusive, accessible course that supports diverse learners through Universal Design for Learning, accommodations, and culturally responsive practices.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: To make their course accessible and inclusive for all learners

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and delivery mode (online/in-person/hybrid)
- Known student diversity (learning disabilities, English learners, etc.)
- Current accessibility level (starting from scratch vs. some features in place)
- Priority areas to address

**5-minute starter**:
1. Identify one aspect of your course where students face barriers (videos without captions, text-heavy materials, timed assessments)
2. Note who is most affected (visual impairments, ADHD, English learners, etc.)
3. List 2-3 quick wins you could implement immediately (add captions, provide outlines, extend time)
4. Consider what content you present in only one format and plan alternatives
5. Draft a simple accessibility statement for your syllabus

**Common first use**: "Design accessibility plan for 'Introduction to Biology' - fully online, 150 students including students with learning disabilities and English learners. Currently minimal accessibility features. Need to meet WCAG standards and implement UDL principles. Priority: digital accessibility."

**Expected output**: Comprehensive accessibility plan with UDL framework (multiple means of representation, engagement, expression), WCAG compliance checklist, accommodation strategies for various disabilities, culturally responsive practices, and ready-to-use syllabus accessibility statement.

**Best for**: New course launches, accessibility audits, responding to accommodation requests, redesigning courses for inclusivity, meeting institutional requirements.
