# Change Management & Adoption Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for managing organizational change initiatives, facilitating adoption strategies, and effectively addressing resistance while ensuring successful transformation and sustained behavioral change across the organization.

## Quick Start

Launch your change initiative with these essential steps:

1. **Assess Change Readiness** - Survey key stakeholders to understand current sentiment, identify potential resistance sources, and gauge organizational capacity for change. Document baseline metrics for employee engagement, process efficiency, and performance indicators you'll track.

2. **Develop Core Messages** - Create 3-5 key messages that answer: Why this change? Why now? What's in it for me? How will we support you? Practice these messages with your leadership team to ensure consistency across all communications.

3. **Identify Change Champions** - Select 5-10 respected employees across different departments and levels who can advocate for the change. Provide them with detailed information, address their concerns first, and equip them with FAQs and talking points.

**Pro Tip**: Create a simple communication calendar with weekly touchpoints for the first month. Include: leadership announcement → team meetings → one-on-one check-ins → progress updates. Repeat key messages 7-10 times through different channels.
