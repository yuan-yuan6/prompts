# Corporate Contract Management & Legal Ops Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to run enterprise contract management and legal operations across six dimensions: Governance & Policy, Intake & Triage, Templates & Playbooks, Tooling & Data, Risk/Compliance Controls, and Performance & Continuous Improvement. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce an actionable roadmap.

## Template

Conduct a corporate contract management and legal ops readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} managing {CONTRACT_PORTFOLIO} across {JURISDICTIONS} using {CLM_TOOLING}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. GOVERNANCE & POLICY READINESS**
- Contracting standards and policies exist (who drafts, who approves, how exceptions work)
- Decision rights are clear (legal vs procurement vs business vs risk)
- Contract type taxonomy and ownership model defined (who owns which templates and playbooks)
- Outside counsel and support model defined (when to use, how to control spend)
- Records retention, confidentiality, and access standards defined

**2. INTAKE, TRIAGE & WORK MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Intake captures the minimum needed context (deal summary, risk tier, data use, timeline)
- Triage rules and SLAs are defined and followed (priority, routing, escalation)
- Work is tracked end-to-end (requests, assignments, status, blockers)
- Stakeholders are engaged early (security/privacy/finance/compliance as needed)
- Negotiation cadence and decision meetings are predictable

**3. TEMPLATES, PLAYBOOKS & POSITIONS READINESS**
- Standard templates exist for common agreements (and are current)
- Clause library includes preferred language and fallbacks for high-friction terms
- Negotiation playbooks define positions, tradeables, and escalation thresholds
- Non-standard clauses are logged with rationale and approvals (exception discipline)
- Learnings feed back into templates and playbooks

**4. TOOLING, DATA & REPOSITORY READINESS**
- Executed contracts are centralized and complete (final packages, exhibits)
- Minimum metadata standard is defined and enforced (term, renewal, value, owners, risk tier)
- Search/reporting is reliable (portfolio views, renewals, obligations, exceptions)
- Audit trails exist (who changed what and when)
- Integrations are sane where needed (CRM/ERP/procurement, e-signature)

**5. RISK, COMPLIANCE & CONTROLS READINESS**
- Risk tiering model exists and drives approvals and control requirements
- Privacy/security commitments are measurable (standards, evidence, timelines)
- Regulatory and policy obligations are translated into contracting guardrails
- Evidence is trackable and retrievable (SOC/ISO, insurance, DPAs, approvals, exceptions)
- Post-signature obligations are owned and monitored (notices, audits, SLAs)

**6. PERFORMANCE, METRICS & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
- KPIs are defined (cycle time, rework loops, exception rate, renewal surprises)
- Legal ops has a measurable operating rhythm (weekly queues, monthly reporting)
- Root-cause analysis is used on bottlenecks and recurring exceptions
- Training and enablement exist (how to use templates, when to escalate)
- Improvement backlog is prioritized and delivered (process + tooling + content)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **OPERATING MODEL** - Intake/triage map, decision rights, and SLA targets
4. **PORTFOLIO BASELINE** - Coverage %, top contract types, renewal exposure, exception hotspots
5. **ROADMAP** - 90-day stabilization plan + 12-month capability roadmap
6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Current baseline vs 6- and 12-month targets

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc work, limited standards, reactive risk handling)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (templates exist, inconsistent intake and tracking)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable workflows, roles and approvals are clear)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured throughput, disciplined exceptions, proactive renewals)
- 5.0: Optimized (high consistency, automation where valuable, continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization managing contracts | "Apex Manufacturing" |
| `[CONTRACT_PORTFOLIO]` | Scope of contracts | "~1,200 vendor + customer contracts" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US + EU" |
| `[CLM_TOOLING]` | CLM and supporting tooling | "Ironclad + Salesforce" |

## Example

**Manufacturing - Enterprise CLM + Legal Ops**

> Assess contract management + legal ops readiness for **Apex Manufacturing** managing **~1,200 vendor + customer contracts** across **US + EU** using **Ironclad + Salesforce**. Governance is unclear across procurement/legal; intake lacks required data; templates exist but playbooks/fallbacks are inconsistent; repository coverage is ~70% and metadata quality is uneven; risk tiering isn’t applied consistently and evidence is scattered; KPIs exist but aren’t used to drive improvement. Provide scorecard, top gaps, a 90-day stabilization plan, and a 12-month roadmap.
