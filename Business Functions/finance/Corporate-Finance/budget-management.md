# Budget Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run budget management across six dimensions: Budget Scope & Structure, Assumptions & Drivers, Planning Process & Calendar, Tracking & Variance Analysis, Forecasting & Reforecasting, and Governance & Decision Rights. Identify gaps and produce an executable budget cadence.

## Template

Conduct a budget management readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} for fiscal period {FISCAL_YEAR}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. BUDGET SCOPE & STRUCTURE READINESS**
- Budget scope is defined (OpEx, CapEx, headcount, cash)
- Chart of accounts mapping is consistent across teams and tools
- Cost centers and owners are defined (who controls what)
- Revenue model and allocation logic are defined (if applicable)
- Baseline (prior year actuals) is available and reconciled

**2. ASSUMPTIONS & DRIVERS READINESS**
- Driver list is explicit (HC, comp, volume, pricing, FX, cloud usage)
- Assumptions are documented and versioned (what changed and why)
- Sensitivity ranges exist for key drivers
- One-time vs recurring items are separated
- Strategic initiatives are mapped to budget lines

**3. PLANNING PROCESS & CALENDAR READINESS**
- Planning method is defined (top-down, bottom-up, zero-based)
- Calendar is defined with milestones and review gates
- Templates are standardized (inputs, validations, required fields)
- Cross-functional dependencies are managed (HR, Finance, Procurement)
- Quality checks exist (math integrity, reasonableness, completeness)

**4. TRACKING & VARIANCE ANALYSIS READINESS**
- Actuals close process is timely and reliable
- Variance thresholds are defined (materiality by account/category)
- Root cause and corrective actions are captured
- Forecast-to-actual accuracy is tracked (bias and error)
- Reporting is consistent and action-oriented

**5. FORECASTING & REFORECASTING READINESS**
- Reforecast cadence exists (monthly/quarterly/rolling 12-month)
- Driver-based forecasting is used where possible
- Scenario planning exists (base/adverse/upside)
- Cash flow forecasting is integrated (runway, working capital)
- Decision triggers exist for reallocation or spend controls

**6. GOVERNANCE & DECISION RIGHTS READINESS**
- Approval hierarchy is defined (who can commit spend and when)
- Reallocation rules exist (what can move, thresholds, documentation)
- Exceptions are logged with owners and time-bound remediation
- Stakeholder cadence exists (budget reviews, exec updates)
- Tooling and data governance are defined (source of truth)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 gaps
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **BUDGET CALENDAR** - Milestones, owners, inputs, review gates
4. **ASSUMPTIONS LOG** - Driver assumptions with versions and rationale
5. **VARIANCE PLAYBOOK** - Thresholds, root-cause categories, required actions
6. **90-DAY PLAN** - Improvements, owners, and success metrics

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc planning; weak tracking and governance)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic templates; inconsistent forecasting and analysis)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable cadence; clear owners and drivers)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined governance; reliable forecasting)
- 5.0: Optimized (driver-based planning with fast decision cycles)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "TechStart Inc." |
| `[FISCAL_YEAR]` | Fiscal period | "FY2026" |
| `[BUDGET_TYPE]` | Budget type | "Annual operating budget" |
| `[REFORECAST_CADENCE]` | Reforecast cadence | "Rolling 12-month" |
| `[THRESHOLDS]` | Variance thresholds | "5% / $50K" |

## Example

**SaaS Company Budget - Readiness**

> Assess budget management readiness for **TechStart Inc.** planning an **annual** budget for **FY2026**. Structure exists but COA mapping and cost center ownership need tightening; assumptions are present but not versioned and driver sensitivity is missing; process calendar exists but templates and QA checks are inconsistent; variance analysis is done but actions and root cause categories aren’t standardized; forecasting cadence exists but bias tracking is missing; governance needs clearer approval and reallocation rules. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day improvement checklist.
