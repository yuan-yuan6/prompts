# Candidate Assessment & Selection

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive assessment methods and structured selection processes to make objective, data-driven hiring decisions that predict job success.

## Quick Start
1. **Define Assessment Criteria** - Identify 4-6 key competencies (technical and behavioral) that predict success in the role
2. **Select Assessment Methods** - Choose 2-3 evaluation tools: structured interviews, skills tests, work samples, or assessments
3. **Create Evaluation Framework** - Build a scoring matrix with weighted criteria to objectively compare candidates
4. **Conduct Reference Checks** - Prepare 8-10 targeted questions to validate candidate performance and fit
5. **Make Data-Driven Decisions** - Consolidate all assessment data and use the evaluation matrix to identify the best fit
