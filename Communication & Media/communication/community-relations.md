# Community Relations & Stakeholder Engagement Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build **strong, authentic community relationships** that create social license to operate, foster trust, and generate mutual value. Use this to diagnose gaps in stakeholder understanding, engagement strategy, and partnership effectiveness.

## Template

Conduct a community relations & stakeholder engagement readiness assessment for {COMMUNITY_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (stakeholder trust, partnership depth, community sentiment, social license strength).

**1) STAKEHOLDER UNDERSTANDING & MAPPING**
- Key stakeholders are identified and prioritized (not just obvious ones)
- Stakeholder interests, concerns, and influence are understood deeply
- Relationships are mapped (allies, neutrals, opponents, connectors)
- Community needs and priorities are researched (not assumed)

**2) ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY & AUTHENTICITY**
- Engagement is proactive, not reactive (build trust before you need it)
- Strategy is tailored by stakeholder type and maturity (not one-size-fits-all)
- Commitments are realistic and followed through (no overpromising)
- Two-way dialogue is prioritized over one-way broadcasting

**3) PARTNERSHIP QUALITY & MUTUAL VALUE**
- Partnerships align organizational capabilities with genuine community needs
- Value flows both ways (not transactional CSR or checkbook philanthropy)
- Partners are empowered and co-create (not just recipients)
- Long-term relationships are prioritized over short-term optics

**4) COMMUNICATION & TRANSPARENCY**
- Communication is consistent, accessible, and culturally appropriate
- Difficult topics are addressed openly (not avoided or spun)
- Community feedback is actively sought and demonstrably acted upon
- Impact is reported transparently (wins and challenges)

**5) ORGANIZATIONAL INTEGRATION & ACCOUNTABILITY**
- Community relations is embedded in operations (not bolted-on PR)
- Leadership is visible and accountable to community commitments
- Cross-functional teams coordinate stakeholder touchpoints
- Community considerations influence decisions (procurement, hiring, operations)

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Stakeholder sentiment and trust are measured regularly (surveys, feedback)
- Partnership impact is tracked (outcomes, not just outputs or dollars spent)
- Social license strength is monitored and risk-managed
- Learnings inform strategy evolution and investment prioritization

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, social license risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **STAKEHOLDER LANDSCAPE MAP**
- Key stakeholders by category, influence/interest matrix, relationship quality
- Priority concerns, risks, and engagement opportunities

4) **PARTNERSHIP & ENGAGEMENT INVENTORY**
- Current partnerships, programs, and investments (scope, impact, satisfaction)
- Engagement touchpoints, frequency, and effectiveness

5) **COMMUNITY SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**
- Trust/reputation metrics, media coverage tone, social listening insights
- Top concerns, perceptions, and advocacy opportunities

6) **30/60/90-DAY COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING PLAN**
- Actions to improve stakeholder trust, partnership quality, and engagement
- Metrics (trust scores, partnership satisfaction, engagement reach, social license)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, transactional, low trust, siloed)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic outreach, inconsistent engagement, limited partnerships)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (proactive strategy, solid relationships, mutual value)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high trust, deep partnerships, strong social license)
- 5.0: Optimized (community champion, industry-leading impact, resilient trust)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {COMMUNITY_CONTEXT}: Org type, geographic footprint, stakeholder complexity, reputation status
- {OBJECTIVES}: Social license, trust, partnership impact, and reputation goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Budget, staff capacity, past controversies, community skepticism

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {COMMUNITY_CONTEXT}: Regional energy utility (500K customers, 3-state footprint). History of rate disputes and environmental controversies (trust low). Current community engagement: reactive (responds to complaints, attends public hearings). Partnerships: $2M/year in grants (checklist approach, minimal impact measurement). Stakeholders: regulators, environmental groups, local governments, customer advocates, community organizations.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Rebuild trust to 60% favorable (current 35%), establish 10 strategic partnerships (current 3 meaningful relationships), achieve "good neighbor" reputation, secure community support for infrastructure projects.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $3M community relations budget; 5-person team (new hires); legacy of mistrust from rate increases; environmental groups adversarial; regulatory scrutiny high.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.3 (Developing)
- Key risks: 35% trust threatens social license and project approvals; reactive engagement misses opportunities; checkbook partnerships lack depth
- Top improvements: (1) launch stakeholder listening tour, (2) shift from grants to strategic partnerships, (3) embed community considerations in operations

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Stakeholder Understanding & Mapping: 2/5 — basic list exists; interests/concerns not deeply understood; no relationship mapping
- Engagement Strategy & Authenticity: 2/5 — reactive engagement (complaints, hearings); one-size-fits-all approach; overpromised in past
- Partnership Quality & Mutual Value: 2/5 — $2M in grants but transactional; minimal co-creation; focused on optics over outcomes
- Communication & Transparency: 3/5 — consistent rate communications; crisis response functional; but avoids difficult environmental topics
- Organizational Integration: 2/5 — community relations siloed in corporate affairs; leadership not visible; operations don't consider community impact
- Measurement & Improvement: 3/5 — annual trust survey conducted; partnership impact not measured beyond dollars spent

**3) STAKEHOLDER LANDSCAPE MAP**
- Key stakeholders (by category):
  - Regulators: public utilities commissions (3 states), EPA regional offices — high influence, neutral-to-supportive
  - Environmental groups: Sierra Club, local watershed coalitions — high influence, adversarial
  - Local governments: mayors, city councils (50 municipalities) — high influence, mixed (supportive in some areas, skeptical in others)
  - Customer advocates: consumer protection offices, senior/low-income advocates — medium influence, skeptical
  - Community organizations: chambers of commerce, rotaries, schools, nonprofits — medium influence, neutral
  - Media: local newspapers, TV, bloggers — medium influence, skeptical (legacy of negative coverage)
- Influence/interest matrix:
  - High influence, high interest: environmental groups (adversarial), regulators (neutral), customer advocates (skeptical)
  - High influence, low interest: local governments (focus on jobs/tax base, not rates)
  - Low influence, high interest: community organizations (willing partners, want energy efficiency programs)
- Relationship quality: 20% strong (regulators, some mayors), 30% functional (transactional), 50% weak or adversarial
- Priority concerns (from media/public comments): rate increases, environmental impact (coal plants), aging infrastructure reliability, clean energy transition speed
- Risks: environmental group opposition to infrastructure projects; customer advocate resistance to rate cases; low trust amplifies all controversies
- Engagement opportunities: clean energy champions (mayors, businesses), workforce development (schools, training orgs), economic development (chambers)

**4) PARTNERSHIP & ENGAGEMENT INVENTORY**
- Current partnerships:
  - Grant programs: $2M/year to 200+ nonprofits (avg $10K grants, application-based, low strategic alignment)
  - Energy efficiency partnerships: 5 nonprofits deliver weatherization (functional, limited scale)
  - Workforce development: 2 community colleges (apprenticeship pipeline, effective)
- Programs:
  - Low-income rate assistance: $5M/year (necessary but not seen as community investment)
  - Educational programs: school energy demos (low engagement, outdated approach)
  - Volunteer program: 200 employees volunteer 2K hrs/year (not strategic, limited community visibility)
- Engagement touchpoints:
  - Public hearings (regulatory): 10/year (adversarial, required)
  - Customer service: 500K interactions/year (mostly complaints, not community relations)
  - Media relations: reactive (crisis/rate announcements only)
  - Community events: 20 sponsorships/year (logo placement, no deeper engagement)
- Effectiveness: grant recipients satisfied (66%), but limited community impact; workforce partnerships strong; public hearings combative; sponsorships low visibility

**5) COMMUNITY SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**
- Trust/reputation metrics:
  - Trust score: 35% favorable (industry avg 45%, goal 60%)
  - Net Promoter Score: -12 (customers likely to criticize vs. recommend)
  - "Good corporate citizen": 28% agree (goal 55%)
- Media coverage tone (past 12 months): 55% negative (rate increases, environmental), 30% neutral (operational updates), 15% positive (workforce, economic development)
- Social listening insights (Twitter, Facebook, Nextdoor): 
  - Rate increases dominate conversation (60% of mentions)
  - Environmental concerns rising (coal plant retirement, clean energy transition) — 25%
  - Reliability/outages episodic but high emotion — 10%
  - Positive mentions of lineworkers, storm response, community programs — 5%
- Top concerns (from survey, public comments):
  - Affordability (rate increases outpace income growth)
  - Environmental impact (coal emissions, water use, clean energy transition too slow)
  - Reliability (aging infrastructure, storm response)
  - Accountability (perception of distant corporate entity, not community partner)
- Perceptions: "necessary evil," "profits over people," "not listening," "opaque"
- Advocacy opportunities: clean energy champions (environmental + business), workforce development, economic development (job creation, local procurement)

**6) 30/60/90-DAY COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING PLAN**
- 30 days: launch stakeholder listening tour (CEO/execs meet 20 key stakeholders 1-on-1 to listen, not sell); map all community touchpoints (identify coordination gaps); publish first "community impact report" (transparency on investments, jobs, environmental progress)
- 60 days: shift $500K grants to 5 strategic partnerships co-created with community (e.g., energy efficiency + workforce development); launch community advisory council (12 diverse stakeholders, quarterly meetings); train 50 managers on stakeholder engagement (community considerations in decisions)
- 90 days: pilot "open house" series at 3 facilities (demystify operations, showcase clean energy); establish community feedback portal (online + phone, track/respond); measure trust (goal 42%), partnership satisfaction (goal 75% of strategic partners), media tone (goal 40% neutral/positive)
- Metrics: trust score (goal 42% by 90 days), media tone (goal 25% positive), partnership satisfaction (goal 75%), stakeholder meeting count (goal 50 engagements)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Build trust before you need it: proactive engagement in good times creates resilience in bad times.
2) Listen more than you talk: stakeholder understanding drives authentic strategy, not assumptions.
3) Map influence and relationships: understand who influences whom—connectors multiply your reach.
4) Co-create partnerships with community: mutual value beats checkbook philanthropy every time.
5) Integrate community into operations: procurement, hiring, and facility decisions signal real commitment.
6) Be transparent about trade-offs: acknowledge tensions (e.g., rates vs. clean energy) honestly.
7) Make leadership visible and accountable: CEOs and execs must show up, listen, and follow through.
8) Measure trust and impact, not just spending: track stakeholder sentiment, partnership outcomes, and social license strength.
