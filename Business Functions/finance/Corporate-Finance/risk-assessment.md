# Enterprise Risk Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to run repeatable, decision-grade risk assessments across market, credit, operational, and regulatory domains and to convert findings into monitored mitigation actions.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess enterprise risk readiness for [ORGANIZATION] covering [RISK_CATEGORIES] over [ASSESSMENT_TIMEFRAME]. Evaluate risk taxonomy and inventory, data/measurement capability (including stress testing/VaR where relevant), scenario discipline, governance and controls, reporting and KRIs, and mitigation execution. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Risk Taxonomy & Inventory
- 1: Risk discussions are informal; coverage is inconsistent.
- 3: Inventory exists for major risks; refresh is periodic.
- 5: Standard taxonomy, ownership, and refresh cadence are defined.

2) Data, Exposure Mapping & Measurement
- 1: Exposures are unclear; metrics are inconsistent.
- 3: Some metrics exist (limits, concentrations, basic stress tests).
- 5: Traceable exposures, consistent metrics, and documented methodology.

3) Scenario, Stress Testing & Sensitivities
- 1: Limited downside framing.
- 3: Standard scenarios used for major cycles.
- 5: Driver-based scenarios, severe stress tests, and thresholds are standard.

4) Controls, Limits & Governance
- 1: Limits and controls are unclear or unenforced.
- 3: Controls exist for key risks; enforcement varies.
- 5: Clear limits, control testing, and escalation paths are standard.

5) Reporting, KRIs & Monitoring Cadence
- 1: Reporting is ad hoc; signals are late.
- 3: Dashboards exist for key risks; cadence is periodic.
- 5: KRIs, thresholds, and regular review cadence are standard.

6) Mitigation Planning & Execution
- 1: Mitigation is vague; ownership is unclear.
- 3: Plans exist for top risks; tracking is uneven.
- 5: Plans have owners, timelines, and effectiveness tracking.

## Deliverables
- Risk inventory (risk statement, owner, drivers, horizon)
- Exposure map (where risks live and how they transmit)
- Scenario and stress test summary (assumptions and results)
- KRI dashboard (thresholds and escalation rules)
- Mitigation plan (actions, owners, timelines, triggers)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — qualitative and inconsistent.
- Level 2: Documented — partial inventory and controls.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard scenarios and reporting for key risks.
- Level 4: Managed — thresholds, monitoring cadence, and escalation are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from incidents and outcomes.

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]
- [RISK_CATEGORIES] (market, credit, operational, regulatory)
- [ASSESSMENT_TIMEFRAME]
- [RISK_APPETITE]
- [SCENARIOS]
- [KRIS]
- [LIMITS]
- [MITIGATION_ACTIONS]

## Example (Condensed)
Quarterly enterprise risk assessment for a multi-entity financial services group.
- Coverage: market (rates/FX), credit (concentrations), operational (cyber/settlement), regulatory.
- Scenarios: base, downside, severe stress with thresholds that trigger actions.
- Output: top risks + KRIs + mitigation owners and timelines.
