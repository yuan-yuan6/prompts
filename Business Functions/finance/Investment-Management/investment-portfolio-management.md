# Investment Portfolio Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage an investment portfolio across six dimensions: Mandate & IPS Clarity, Portfolio Construction & Allocation, Risk Management, Rebalancing & Implementation, Performance Measurement & Reporting, and Compliance & Governance. Identify gaps and produce a practical management checklist.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **portfolio management readiness** for **[CLIENT/ORGANIZATION]** managing **$[AUM]** under **[MANDATE]** and **[REGULATORY_CONTEXT]**. Score 1–5 across: (1) **Mandate/IPS**—are objectives, constraints, benchmarks, and decision rights explicit? (2) **Construction**—is the target allocation and investable universe defined and consistent with the mandate? (3) **Risk**—are limits, stress tests, and concentration controls defined and monitored? (4) **Implementation**—are rebalancing rules, transaction costs, and (if relevant) taxes operationalized? (5) **Measurement**—are attribution and client reporting timely, accurate, and explainable? (6) **Governance**—are approvals, exceptions, documentation, and reviews disciplined? Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a “ready-to-manage” checklist.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Conduct a portfolio management readiness assessment for {CLIENT_OR_ORGANIZATION} managing {AUM} under {MANDATE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. MANDATE & IPS CLARITY READINESS**
- Objectives are explicit (return, income, capital preservation, liabilities)
- Risk tolerance is explicit (volatility, drawdown, tracking error)
- Constraints are explicit (liquidity, leverage, ESG, concentration)
- Benchmark(s) and success metrics are defined
- Decision rights and escalation thresholds are defined

**2. PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION & ALLOCATION READINESS**
- Target strategic allocation is defined and documented
- Investable universe is defined (instruments, eligibility, liquidity)
- Diversification rules exist (issuer/sector/geo/factor)
- Active vs passive stance is intentional and documented
- Cash policy is defined (buffers, flows, sweep rules)

**3. RISK MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Risk limits exist and are monitored (position/sector/VAR/CVaR)
- Stress test scenarios are defined and reviewed
- Liquidity risk is measured (time-to-liquidate, bid/ask sensitivity)
- Operational controls exist (trade errors, reconciliations, segregation)
- Exception handling exists (breaches, waivers, remediation timelines)

**4. REBALANCING & IMPLEMENTATION READINESS**
- Rebalancing approach is defined (calendar, threshold, risk-based)
- Transaction costs and trading constraints are modeled
- Tax-aware rules exist where applicable (loss harvesting, asset location)
- Order/execution workflow is owned and controlled
- Documentation exists for trade rationale and approvals

**5. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT & REPORTING READINESS**
- Performance calculation is consistent and reconciled
- Attribution approach is defined (allocation/selection/factor)
- Reporting cadence meets stakeholder needs (monthly/quarterly)
- Narrative explains drivers and changes (not just metrics)
- Data quality controls exist for inputs and outputs

**6. COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE READINESS**
- Regulatory obligations are mapped to controls and reporting
- IPS and guidelines are reviewed on a defined cadence
- Best execution policy and evidence are maintained
- Conflicts of interest and fiduciary controls are defined
- Governance routines exist (investment committee, minutes, decisions)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **READY-TO-MANAGE CHECKLIST** - Minimum inputs and controls needed to operate
4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions
5. **OPERATING CADENCE** - Reviews, reporting, risk checks, and governance meetings
6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Drift control, compliance breach rate, cycle time, client outcomes

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc management; unclear mandate and controls)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic IPS; inconsistent monitoring and reporting)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable process with manageable gaps)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined controls and transparent reporting)
- 5.0: Optimized (continuous improvement and stable, explainable outcomes)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[CLIENT/ORGANIZATION]` | Portfolio owner | "University Endowment" |
| `[AUM]` | Assets under management | "$800M" |
| `[MANDATE]` | Mandate type | "CPI+5% with 5% spending" |
| `[REGULATORY_CONTEXT]` | Regulatory context | "ERISA" |
| `[BENCHMARK]` | Benchmark | "60/40 policy index" |

## Example

**Endowment Portfolio - Management Readiness**

> Assess portfolio management readiness for **University Endowment** managing **$800M** under **CPI+5% with 5% spending**. IPS objectives are clear but constraints and decision rights need tightening; allocation is defined but investable universe and liquidity policy need documentation; risk monitoring exists but stress tests and breach remediation are inconsistent; rebalancing is ad-hoc and should move to threshold rules; reporting is timely but attribution is not standardized; governance cadence needs stronger minutes and exception logs. Provide a scorecard and ready-to-manage checklist.
