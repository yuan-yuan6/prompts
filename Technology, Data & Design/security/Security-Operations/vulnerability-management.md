## Template

Design vulnerability management program for {ORGANIZATION} with {ASSET_COUNT} assets achieving {COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS} compliance with {SLA_TARGETS} remediation timelines.

**ASSET DISCOVERY AND INVENTORY**

Build comprehensive asset visibility before scanning. Discovery methods: active network scanning (Nmap, scanner discovery modules), passive network monitoring (traffic analysis, DHCP logs), agent-based discovery (endpoint agents report home), cloud API integration (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, GCP Asset Inventory), directory services (Active Directory, LDAP), CMDB synchronization. Asset classification: criticality tiers (Tier 1 revenue-impacting, Tier 2 business operations, Tier 3 development/test), data classification (what sensitive data resides), business owner assignment, compliance scope (PCI CDE, HIPAA PHI, SOX financial). Coverage tracking: maintain 95%+ asset coverage, alert on discovered but unmanaged assets, reconcile scanner inventory with CMDB monthly.

**SCANNING STRATEGY**

Configure scanning based on asset criticality and risk. Scan frequency: critical assets (Tier 1) daily or continuous, standard production weekly, development/test bi-weekly, compliance scans per requirements (PCI quarterly by ASV). Scan types: authenticated scans for full visibility (credentialed with least-privilege service accounts), unauthenticated for network-visible vulnerabilities, web application scans (DAST) for application layer, container scanning in CI/CD and runtime, cloud configuration assessment continuous. Scan windows: schedule around business hours for production, overnight for performance-sensitive systems, immediate for emergency zero-day assessment. Performance management: rate limiting to prevent network saturation, scan throttling during peak hours, distributed scanner architecture for scale.

**VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND PRIORITIZATION**

Apply risk-based prioritization beyond CVSS alone. Risk scoring factors: CVSS base score (severity), exploitability (EPSS score, exploit availability, actively exploited in wild), asset criticality (Tier 1 multiplies risk), threat intelligence (actor targeting, industry relevance), exposure (internet-facing vs internal), compensating controls (WAF, network isolation). Priority calculation: Critical = CVSS 9.0+ OR actively exploited OR internet-facing with exploit, High = CVSS 7.0-8.9 with exploit availability, Medium = CVSS 4.0-6.9 or high CVSS with strong compensating controls, Low = CVSS <4.0 or very limited exploitability. False positive management: validation workflow before ticket creation, analyst review for questionable findings, tuned scanner policies reducing noise, exception documentation for known false positives.

**REMEDIATION WORKFLOW**

Implement SLA-driven remediation with accountability. SLA framework: Critical 24-48 hours (zero-day, actively exploited), High 7-14 days (exploitable, significant impact), Medium 30 days (moderate risk), Low 90 days (minimal risk, opportunistic). Workflow: vulnerability validated → ticket created with owner, due date, remediation guidance → owner acknowledges and plans → remediation implemented → verification scan confirms fix → ticket closed with documentation. Remediation methods: patching (OS, application, firmware), configuration changes (disable vulnerable feature, change default credentials), virtual patching (WAF rules, IPS signatures), compensating controls (network isolation, enhanced monitoring), decommissioning (retire vulnerable end-of-life systems). Escalation: auto-escalate at 75% SLA consumed, manager notification at SLA breach, executive escalation for persistent non-compliance.

**PATCH MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION**

Coordinate vulnerability remediation with patch operations. Patch strategy: emergency patching process for zero-days (bypass change advisory board with notification), regular patch cycles (monthly Patch Tuesday alignment), testing requirements (non-prod validation before production), rollback procedures (tested rollback for every patch), change windows (defined maintenance windows by system tier). Deployment: phased rollouts (pilot 5% → 25% → 100%), monitoring post-deployment (24-48 hours observation), SCCM/Intune/Ansible automation, cloud-native patching (AWS Systems Manager, Azure Update Management). Verification: post-patch vulnerability scan to confirm remediation, automatic ticket closure on verified remediation.

**EXCEPTION MANAGEMENT**

Handle vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately remediated. Risk acceptance process: business justification required (why remediation is not feasible), compensating controls documented (what mitigates the risk), executive approval (risk owner sign-off), time-bound exception (maximum 90 days, renewable with review), regular review cycle (monthly exception review meeting). Acceptable exceptions: technical limitations (legacy system, vendor dependency), business impact (remediation requires extended downtime), pending decommission (system retiring within exception period), vendor dependency (awaiting vendor patch). Documentation: exception ID, vulnerability details, business justification, compensating controls, approver, expiration date, review schedule.

**METRICS AND REPORTING**

Track program effectiveness with actionable metrics. Operational metrics: mean time to remediate (MTTR) by severity, SLA compliance rate by severity and team, open vulnerability count and aging, vulnerability density (vulnerabilities per asset), scan coverage percentage, repeat vulnerabilities (same vuln reintroduced). Executive metrics: risk trend over time, SLA compliance trend, top 10 riskiest assets, remediation velocity, compliance status. Reporting cadence: real-time dashboard for operations, weekly operational report (new vulns, SLA status, exceptions), monthly executive report (trends, risk posture, compliance), quarterly compliance report (PCI, NIST, ISO). Dashboards: Tenable.io/Qualys VMDR native dashboards, Splunk/PowerBI for custom analytics, ServiceNow vulnerability response module.

**TOOL INTEGRATION**

Connect vulnerability management to security ecosystem. Ticketing: JIRA/ServiceNow for remediation tracking, automatic ticket creation with severity-based priority, ticket closure on verified remediation. SIEM: vulnerability context in security alerts (is exploited asset vulnerable?), correlation with threat intelligence, risk-based alerting. CMDB: asset enrichment (owner, criticality, environment), bidirectional sync for accuracy. Automation: SOAR playbooks for routine tasks (ticket creation, notification, escalation), automated patching for approved vulnerabilities, integration with configuration management (Ansible, Puppet).

**COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**

Map program to regulatory requirements. PCI-DSS: quarterly external ASV scans with passing results, internal scans after significant changes, remediate high vulnerabilities or document compensating controls, vulnerability management policy documented. HIPAA: regular technical vulnerability assessment, patch management for ePHI systems, risk analysis including vulnerability findings. NIST CSF: identify vulnerabilities (ID.RA-1), protect through patch management (PR.IP-12), detect through scanning (DE.CM-8). SOC 2: vulnerability identification and remediation controls, evidence of scanning and remediation for audit.

Deliver vulnerability management program as:

1. **PROGRAM CHARTER** - Scope, governance, roles and responsibilities (RACI), executive sponsorship

2. **SCANNING STRATEGY** - Asset coverage, scan frequency by tier, scanner configuration, credential management

3. **PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK** - Risk scoring methodology, severity definitions, prioritization workflow

4. **REMEDIATION WORKFLOWS** - SLA framework, ticket workflow, escalation procedures, verification process

5. **PATCH INTEGRATION** - Patch cycle alignment, emergency patching, testing requirements, deployment automation

6. **EXCEPTION PROCESS** - Risk acceptance workflow, approval authority, documentation requirements, review cadence

7. **METRICS DASHBOARD** - KPI definitions, data sources, visualization, reporting schedule
