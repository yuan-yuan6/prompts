## RUBRIC TEMPLATES

### Single-Point Rubric
| Criterion | Areas for Improvement | Meets Standard | Evidence of Exceeding |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| [Criterion 1] | | [Description of standard] | |
| [Criterion 2] | | [Description of standard] | |
| [Criterion 3] | | [Description of standard] | |

**Benefits**: Focuses on feedback, efficient to use, encourages exceeding standards

### Analytic Rubric (4-Point Scale)
| Criterion | Beginning (1) | Developing (2) | Proficient (3) | Exemplary (4) | Points |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Content Knowledge | Limited understanding demonstrated | Basic understanding with gaps | Solid understanding throughout | Deep, nuanced understanding | /4 |
| Organization | Lacks clear structure | Some organization evident | Well-organized and logical | Exceptionally clear structure | /4 |
| Communication | Unclear or ineffective | Generally clear with issues | Clear and effective | Engaging and compelling | /4 |
| **Total** | | | | | /12 |

### Holistic Rubric
**4 - Exemplary**: Demonstrates exceptional understanding and skill. All criteria met at highest level with creativity and insight. Work exceeds expectations in multiple areas.

**3 - Proficient**: Demonstrates solid understanding and competent skill. All major criteria met with quality work. Meets expectations consistently.

**2 - Developing**: Demonstrates partial understanding with developing skills. Some criteria met but gaps or errors present. Approaching expectations.

**1 - Beginning**: Demonstrates limited understanding with minimal skill. Few criteria met with significant gaps. Below expectations.

### Developmental Rubric
**Advanced** (5 points):
- [Detailed description of advanced performance]
- [Key indicators and examples]

**Proficient** (4 points):
- [Detailed description of proficient performance]
- [Key indicators and examples]

**Developing** (3 points):
- [Detailed description of developing performance]
- [Key indicators and examples]

**Emerging** (2 points):
- [Detailed description of emerging performance]
- [Key indicators and examples]

**Beginning** (1 point):
- [Detailed description of beginning performance]
- [Key indicators and examples]

## RUBRIC DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify Learning Outcomes
- What should students know/do/value?
- What are the key competencies?
- What evidence demonstrates achievement?

### Step 2: Determine Criteria
- What specific aspects will be evaluated?
- What are the essential components?
- How many criteria are needed (4-6 recommended)?

### Step 3: Define Performance Levels
- How many levels (3-5 typical)?
- What distinguishes each level?
- What does quality look like at each level?

### Step 4: Write Descriptors
- Use clear, specific language
- Focus on observable behaviors
- Avoid vague terms (good, nice, adequate)
- Include concrete examples

### Step 5: Test and Refine
- Apply to sample work
- Check for inter-rater reliability
- Gather user feedback
- Revise for clarity

## QUALITY RUBRIC CHARACTERISTICS

### Clear and Specific
- Descriptors are precise and detailed
- Observable behaviors identified
- Concrete examples provided
- Unambiguous language used

### Aligned and Valid
- Matches learning outcomes
- Assesses what it claims to assess
- Appropriate for student level
- Relevant to real-world applications

### Comprehensive and Balanced
- All important aspects covered
- Criteria weighted appropriately
- Multiple performance levels
- Range of achievement represented

### User-Friendly
- Easy to understand
- Efficient to apply
- Helpful for feedback
- Accessible to students

## COMMON RUBRIC PITFALLS

### Avoid:
- **Vague descriptors**: "Good quality" vs "Includes 3 specific examples"
- **Undefined terms**: "Excellent" vs "Meets all criteria with no errors"
- **Counting only**: "2 sources" vs "2 credible, relevant sources properly cited"
- **Too many criteria**: Keep to 4-6 main criteria
- **Overlapping levels**: Ensure clear distinction between levels
- **Negative language**: Focus on what is present, not absent
- **Same verb across levels**: Vary verbs to show progression
- **Bias and assumptions**: Ensure cultural neutrality and accessibility

## Ensure rubrics are
- Aligned with learning outcomes
- Clear and specific
- Valid and reliable
- Fair and unbiased
- Student-friendly
- Feedback-rich
- Continuously improved
- Properly validated
```

## Variables
- `[ASSESSMENT_CATEGORY]`: Assessment type
- `[LEARNING_OBJECTIVES]`: Learning outcomes
- `[PERFORMANCE_TASKS]`: Performance criteria
- `[PERFORMANCE_LEVELS]`: Scoring levels
- `[GRADING_APPROACH]`: Point scale
- `[ACADEMIC_LEVEL]`: Student level

## Best Practices

1. **Involve students** - Share rubrics before assessment
2. **Use clear language** - Avoid jargon and vagueness
3. **Focus on key criteria** - Don't try to assess everything
4. **Provide examples** - Show what each level looks like
5. **Test before using** - Apply to sample work
6. **Train raters** - Ensure consistent application
7. **Collect feedback** - Improve based on experience
8. **Share with students** - Use as learning tool
9. **Link to learning** - Connect to outcomes
10. **Revise regularly** - Update based on evidence

## Tips for Success

- Start with a template and adapt to your needs
- Use action verbs that show progression
- Include both process and product criteria when relevant
- Create student-friendly versions with simplified language
- Use rubrics during instruction, not just assessment
- Involve students in creating rubrics when appropriate
- Maintain exemplars that illustrate each performance level
- Consider using single-point rubrics for efficiency
- Build rubric libraries for common assessment types
- Share effective rubrics with colleagues
