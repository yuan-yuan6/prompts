# Tax Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness for year-round tax planning across six dimensions: income complexity, documentation, withholding/estimates, deductions/credits awareness, compliance/workflow, and review discipline.

## Template

Conduct a tax planning readiness assessment for {TAX_PROFILE} pursuing {GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) INCOME & COMPLEXITY CLARITY**
- Income sources understood (W-2, 1099, investments, side business)
- Residency/state considerations recognized (if relevant)
- Filing status and major life changes tracked

**2) DOCUMENTATION & RECORDKEEPING**
- Receipt/document capture system exists and is consistent
- Separation of personal vs business records (if applicable)
- Easy retrieval (one place, labeled, with backups)

**3) WITHHOLDING / ESTIMATES & CASHFLOW**
- A plan exists to avoid big surprises (withholding/estimated taxes)
- Calendar reminders for key due dates
- Cash buffer for tax payments

**4) DEDUCTIONS / CREDITS AWARENESS (HIGH LEVEL)**
- Knows which categories may matter (without over-optimizing)
- Understands documentation requirements at a high level
- Avoids aggressive assumptions without support

**5) COMPLIANCE & FILING WORKFLOW**
- Filing approach chosen (DIY vs professional)
- Checklist for forms and reconciliations
- Risk management (extensions, audit-proof posture, safe defaults)

**6) REVIEW & YEAR-ROUND PLANNING**
- Quarterly review habit (especially for variable income)
- End-of-year checklist exists
- Adjusts strategy after major changes (job, business, move)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next quarter

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **WORKFLOW & CALENDAR**
- Quarterly checklist (Q1–Q4)
- “One place” document system
- Decision points: DIY vs pro, estimates cadence

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency

5) **90-DAY ACTION PLAN**
- Weeks 1–4: setup
- Weeks 5–12: run the system + mid-quarter check

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs targets: documentation completion, on-time payments, surprise tax variance, stress score

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, high surprise risk)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some tracking, gaps remain)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (organized workflow, manageable outcomes)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (predictable, low surprises, consistent reviews)
- 5.0: Optimized (year-round system, resilient to changes)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {TAX_PROFILE} | Income sources + complexity | “W-2 + 1099 side income; moved states” |
| {GOALS} | What you want to optimize for | “Minimize surprises; stay compliant; reduce stress” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “No complex spreadsheets; 30 min/month” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {TAX_PROFILE}: W-2 employee plus 1099 freelance; income varies monthly; wants fewer surprises
- {GOALS}: Predictable tax payments and organized documents
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 30 minutes/month; prefers simple checklists; open to using a professional

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.0/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) set a document capture system, (2) calendar quarterly check-ins, (3) decide DIY vs pro early

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Income & Complexity | 3.5 | Clear sources | Track life changes and state issues |
| Documentation | 2.5 | Receipts scattered | One folder + monthly capture habit |
| Withholding/Estimates | 2.5 | No cadence | Quarterly review + buffer |
| Deductions/Credits | 3.0 | Basic awareness | Avoid assumptions; confirm requirements |
| Compliance Workflow | 3.0 | Willing to get help | Choose workflow and checklist |
| Review & Planning | 3.5 | Open to quarterly reviews | Put on calendar |

3) **WORKFLOW & CALENDAR**
- Monthly: file receipts/docs into one system; reconcile income summary
- Quarterly: review income; estimate taxes; set aside payment buffer; confirm due dates
- Year-end: finalize documentation; decide pro help; prepare forms checklist

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Surprise tax bills → no estimate cadence → quarterly review routine
- Gap 2: Missing documents → scattered storage → one-place system
- Gap 3: Last-minute filing → no workflow → checklist and earlier decision
- Gap 4: Variable income swings → no buffer → build tax buffer line item
- Gap 5: Over-optimization risk → unclear rules → use conservative defaults

5) **90-DAY ACTION PLAN**
- Weeks 1–2: create document system; set reminders
- Weeks 3–4: define quarterly workflow; decide DIY vs pro
- Weeks 5–12: run the system; mid-quarter check; adjust buffer

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Documentation completeness: low → high (monthly capture done)
- On-time payments: 100%
- Surprise variance: reduce to within an acceptable range
- Stress (self-rated): 7/10 → 5/10

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Be proactive, not reactive** — quarterly reviews reduce surprises.
2) **Use one document system** — scattered records create errors.
3) **Calendar the key dates** — reminders beat memory.
4) **Track income variability** — especially for side income.
5) **Use conservative defaults** — avoid aggressive assumptions.
6) **Decide DIY vs pro early** — the workflow changes everything.
7) **Keep a tax buffer** — cashflow protects compliance.
8) **Review after life changes** — moves, job changes, family changes matter.
