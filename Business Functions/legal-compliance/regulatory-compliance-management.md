# Compliance Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run a compliance management system (CMS) across six dimensions: Regulatory Inventory, Governance & Accountability, Policy/Procedure Control, Monitoring & Investigations, Issue Management & CAPA, and Reporting & Continuous Improvement. Identify gaps and produce a 90-day operational uplift plan.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **compliance management readiness** for **[ORGANIZATION]** in **[INDUSTRY]** across **[JURISDICTIONS]** under **[CORE_REGULATIONS]**. Score 1–5 across: (1) **Reg inventory**—do we maintain a current obligations inventory mapped to processes/owners? (2) **Governance**—are decision rights, escalation, and three lines of defense defined? (3) **Policy control**—are policies/procedures versioned, reviewed, and attested? (4) **Monitoring/investigations**—do we detect issues, investigate with audit trail, and measure effectiveness? (5) **CAPA**—do we remediate, validate, and prevent recurrence? (6) **Reporting/CI**—are KPIs trusted and used to drive improvements? Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Conduct a compliance management readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating across {JURISDICTIONS} under {CORE_REGULATIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. REGULATORY INVENTORY READINESS**
- Regulatory inventory exists and is current
- Obligations are mapped to processes/products and jurisdictions
- Owners are assigned for key obligations and controls
- Third-party obligations and dependencies are included
- Regulatory change intake and assessment workflow exists

**2. GOVERNANCE & ACCOUNTABILITY READINESS**
- Three lines of defense is defined and adopted
- Escalation paths and severity model are documented
- Decision rights exist for exceptions and risk acceptance
- Resourcing and SME coverage matches risk profile
- Stakeholder cadence exists (ops → exec → board)

**3. POLICY & PROCEDURE CONTROL READINESS**
- Policy hierarchy exists (policy → standard → procedure)
- Version control, approvals, and review cadence are enforced
- Procedures specify evidence requirements (how to prove compliance)
- Training/attestation is triggered by policy changes
- Exceptions are governed and time-bound

**4. MONITORING & INVESTIGATIONS READINESS**
- Monitoring coverage map exists (manual + automated)
- Alerts/cases have owners, SLAs, and audit trail
- Investigation playbooks exist for common issues
- KRIs/thresholds are defined and tuned
- Monitoring includes third parties where applicable

**5. ISSUE MANAGEMENT & CAPA READINESS**
- Issues are logged and classified consistently
- Root cause analysis is repeatable
- CAPA plans have owners, milestones, and validation
- Closure criteria exist (fix + effectiveness verification)
- Recurrence is tracked and triggers systemic fixes

**6. REPORTING & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
- KPIs/KRIs are defined with controlled calculations and sources
- Reporting drives decisions (priorities, resourcing, remediation)
- Lessons learned feed back into policies, monitoring, and training
- Evidence is retrievable for audits/exams
- Improvement backlog is prioritized and delivered

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **TOP GAPS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency
4. **90-DAY PLAN** - Sequenced uplift actions with owners and success metrics
5. **METRICS** - KPI/KRI definitions and reporting cadence
6. **EVIDENCE INVENTORY** - Minimum evidence set for audits/exams

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc processes, weak accountability)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some structure, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable workflows and evidence standards)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured effectiveness, disciplined issue handling)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive prevention, continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "Regional Hospital Network" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "Healthcare" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "HIPAA, CMS rules, state privacy" |

## Example

**Healthcare - CMS Readiness**

> Assess compliance management readiness for **Regional Hospital Network** in **healthcare** across **US** under **HIPAA, CMS rules, state privacy**. Regulatory inventory exists but obligation ownership is unclear; policy updates are not consistently attested; investigations are handled via email with limited audit trail; CAPA closure lacks validation and recurrence tracking; dashboards exist but definitions vary by department. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day plan focused on obligation ownership, evidence standards, and CAPA validation.
