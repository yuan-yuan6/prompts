# Clinical Decision Support - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This comprehensive framework has been split into 3 focused sub-prompts for easier navigation and use.

## Framework Structure

### Part 1: Clinical Knowledge Base (Lines 1-366)
**File:** `clinical-decision-support-01-knowledge-base.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 1]

### Part 2: Decision Algorithms (Lines 367-626)
**File:** `clinical-decision-support-02-decision-algorithms.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 2]

### Part 3: Implementation & Integration (Lines 627-1075)
**File:** `clinical-decision-support-03-implementation.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 3]

## Quick Navigation

**Complete Workflow:**
1. Start with Part 1 for clinical knowledge base
2. Start with Part 2 for decision algorithms
3. Start with Part 3 for implementation & integration
