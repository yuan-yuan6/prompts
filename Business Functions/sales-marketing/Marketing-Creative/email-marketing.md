# Email Marketing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run effective email marketing programs across lifecycle stages, including strategy, segmentation, deliverability, automation, and continuous optimization.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess email marketing readiness for [BRAND_NAME] targeting [SUBSCRIBER_SEGMENT] for [EMAIL_OBJECTIVE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Lifecycle strategy & segmentation, (2) Content & copy system, (3) Deliverability & list health, (4) Automation & tooling, (5) Measurement & experimentation, (6) Governance, compliance & operations. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, and a 60-day improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Lifecycle Strategy & Segmentation
- 1 — Initial: One-size-fits-all sends; lifecycle goals unclear; minimal segmentation.
- 3 — Defined: Lifecycle stages mapped; segments defined; sequences support objectives (welcome, nurture, winback).
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is data-driven; personalization rules are clear; lifecycle programs are continuously tuned.

### 2) Content & Copy System
- 1 — Initial: Inconsistent voice; ad-hoc templates; weak message-match to landing pages.
- 3 — Defined: Content pillars and templates; subject line patterns; consistent structure and CTA conventions.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular content system; high-quality personalization; copy is guided by insights and tested systematically.

### 3) Deliverability & List Health
- 1 — Initial: No deliverability monitoring; list hygiene inconsistent; complaints and bounces unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Authentication and hygiene routines; suppression rules; deliverability KPIs tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Proactive deliverability management; reputation protected; segmentation reduces fatigue and complaints.

### 4) Automation & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Mostly manual campaigns; tooling underused; triggers and data integration are weak.
- 3 — Defined: Key automations implemented; CRM/CDP integration supports basic personalization.
- 5 — Optimized: Automation is robust and maintainable; data flows are reliable; experimentation and reporting are streamlined.

### 5) Measurement & Experimentation
- 1 — Initial: Metrics limited to opens/clicks; no hypotheses; inconsistent analysis.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework (engagement + conversion); test cadence; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program; incrementality awareness; optimization focuses on downstream outcomes (revenue, retention).

### 6) Governance, Compliance & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Consent and preference management is unclear; approvals inconsistent; operational errors occur.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance checklist (CAN-SPAM/GDPR/etc.); QA routines; clear owners and review workflow.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance is embedded; preference center drives relevance; operations are reliable and auditable.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence and top gaps
- Lifecycle map with core sequences (welcome, nurture, promo, winback)
- Content templates and CTA conventions
- Deliverability checklist (auth, hygiene, monitoring)
- Testing plan and measurement framework

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [SUBSCRIBER_SEGMENT]: Segment (new signups, leads, customers, inactive)
- [EMAIL_OBJECTIVE]: Onboard, convert, retain, re-engage
- [EMAIL_TYPES]: Newsletter, sequence, promotional, transactional
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: Engagement and conversion KPIs
- [COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS]: Consent, preferences, disclosures

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Retail subscription box
- Objective: Improve welcome series conversion
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Content 2; Deliverability 3; Automation 2; Testing 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Weak content modularity; limited personalization; inconsistent experimentation
- 60-day priorities: Define templates + CTA rules; improve triggers; run weekly subject/offer tests tied to conversion
