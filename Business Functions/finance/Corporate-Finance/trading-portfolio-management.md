# Portfolio Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to manage portfolios with repeatable processes for objective setting, allocation, risk control, execution, and performance measurement.

## Quick Prompt
Assess portfolio-management readiness for [CLIENT_TYPE/PORTFOLIO] with [AUM] AUM and [TIME_HORIZON]. Evaluate objectives and constraints, asset allocation and IPS discipline, risk management and limits, implementation and rebalancing, performance and attribution, and governance/reporting. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Objectives, Constraints & Investment Policy
- 1: Objectives are unclear; constraints are informal.
- 3: IPS exists for major accounts; updates are periodic.
- 5: Objectives, constraints, and policy are explicit, owned, and current.

2) Asset Allocation & Portfolio Construction
- 1: Allocation is improvised; diversification rules are unclear.
- 3: Strategic allocation exists with periodic review.
- 5: Clear construction rules, factor exposures, and rationale are documented.

3) Risk Management & Limits
- 1: Limits are unclear; risk is monitored reactively.
- 3: Some limits exist (concentration, duration, VaR) for key portfolios.
- 5: Limits, monitoring cadence, stress tests, and escalation paths are standard.

4) Implementation & Rebalancing
- 1: Execution is inconsistent; rebalancing is sporadic.
- 3: Calendar/threshold rebalancing used for major portfolios.
- 5: Clear implementation playbook (liquidity, taxes, costs) and change control.

5) Performance Measurement & Attribution
- 1: Performance is reported without benchmarks or attribution.
- 3: Benchmarks exist for key portfolios; attribution is periodic.
- 5: Benchmark policy, attribution methodology, and data quality controls are standard.

6) Governance, Compliance & Reporting
- 1: Reporting is ad hoc; decision rights unclear.
- 3: Reviews occur for major changes and risks.
- 5: Formal governance, compliance checks, and consistent reporting cadence.

## Deliverables
- Investment policy (objectives, constraints, permissible instruments)
- Strategic allocation and portfolio construction rationale
- Risk limits and monitoring dashboard (including stress tests as applicable)
- Rebalancing policy (triggers, cadence, costs, approvals)
- Performance pack (benchmarks, attribution, commentary)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent processes and reporting.
- Level 2: Documented — IPS and templates exist but vary in practice.
- Level 3: Repeatable — allocation, rebalancing, and reporting are standard for most portfolios.
- Level 4: Managed — risk limits, attribution, and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement via outcomes and measured effectiveness.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_TYPE/PORTFOLIO]
- [AUM]
- [TIME_HORIZON]
- [RISK_PROFILE]
- [CONSTRAINTS] (liquidity, taxes, ESG, concentration)
- [BENCHMARKS]
- [REBALANCING_RULES]
- [RISK_LIMITS]

## Example (Condensed)
Institutional balanced portfolio with a 7-year horizon.
- IPS: return target, drawdown limits, liquidity needs.
- Allocation: strategic 60/35/5 with rebalancing bands.
- Risk: concentration limits, duration constraints, quarterly stress tests.
- Reporting: monthly performance vs benchmark with attribution and commentary.
