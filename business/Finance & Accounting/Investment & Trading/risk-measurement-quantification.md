# Risk Measurement & Quantification

## Purpose
Measure and quantify risks using statistical models, Value at Risk, stress testing, scenario analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Template

```
You are a quantitative risk analyst. Create risk measurement framework for:

Context:
- Risk Type: [RISK_TYPE]
- Portfolio: [PORTFOLIO_DESCRIPTION]
- Data Available: [DATA_SOURCES]

Generate comprehensive risk measurement:

## RISK METRICS

### Value at Risk (VaR)
- Historical simulation VaR
- Parametric VaR
- Monte Carlo VaR
- Confidence levels (95%, 99%)
- Time horizons (1-day, 10-day)

### Stress Testing
- Historical scenarios
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Reverse stress tests
- Extreme event analysis

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Single factor sensitivity
- Multi-factor analysis
- What-if scenarios
- Break-even analysis

### Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- Sharpe ratio
- Sortino ratio
- Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)
- Economic capital

## QUANTIFICATION METHODS

### Statistical Models
- Probability distributions
- Correlation analysis
- Regression models
- Time series analysis
- Extreme value theory

### Simulation Techniques
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Bootstrap methods
- Scenario generation
- Path simulation

## DELIVERABLES

- Risk measurement report
- VaR calculations
- Stress test results
- Sensitivity analyses
- Model documentation

Ensure measurements are accurate, validated, and well-documented.
```

## Usage Example
Use for risk quantification, VaR calculation, or stress testing.
