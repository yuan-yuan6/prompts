# ESG Risk Assessment & Management Template

## Purpose
Systematically identify, assess, prioritize, and manage Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks that could impact business operations, financial performance, reputation, and long-term value creation, integrating ESG risks into enterprise risk management.

## Quick Start

**Need ESG risk assessment quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Manufacturing company
Top ESG Risks:
1. Climate Transition Risk (High): Carbon pricing exposure $15M/year by 2030
   - Mitigation: 50% emissions reduction, renewable energy, efficiency
2. Supply Chain Labor Risk (Medium): Reputation/revenue impact if violations found
   - Mitigation: Supplier audits, capability building, transparency
3. Workplace Safety Risk (High): LTIR above industry average, legal/insurance costs
   - Mitigation: Safety culture program, training, leading indicators
4. Water Scarcity Risk (Medium): 2 facilities in high water-stress areas
   - Mitigation: Water efficiency, alternative sources, scenario planning
5. Board Governance Risk (Low-Medium): Limited ESG expertise, investor concern
   - Mitigation: Add ESG-experienced director, ESG committee, training

Risk Management: Quarterly ESG risk review integrated into ERM, board oversight
```

### When to Use This
- Developing or enhancing ESG strategy (risk assessment foundational)
- Integrating ESG into enterprise risk management
- Preparing for TCFD or CSRD climate risk disclosure
- Responding to ESG rating agencies or investor inquiries
- Managing specific ESG incidents or controversies

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Risk Identification** - Identify potential ESG risks across E, S, G (2-3 weeks)
2. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate likelihood and impact of each risk (2-3 weeks)
3. **Risk Prioritization** - Rank risks and determine focus areas (1 week)
4. **Mitigation Planning** - Develop controls and mitigation strategies (3-4 weeks)
5. **Monitoring & Reporting** - Establish ongoing risk monitoring (ongoing)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Manufacturing Company ESG Risk Assessment
```
Company: Automotive parts manufacturer ($2B revenue, 12 facilities, 8,000 employees)
Top 5 ESG Risks:
1. Carbon pricing (Critical): $20M exposure by 2030, 50% mitigation = $10M residual
2. Workplace safety (High): LTIR 2.1 (target 1.5), potential serious incidents
3. Supply chain disruption - climate (High): Flooding risk at 3 key suppliers
4. Water scarcity (Medium): 2 facilities in high water-stress regions
5. Talent retention (Medium): Turnover 18% (industry 12%), green skills gap

TCFD: 3 scenarios (1.5°C, 2.5°C, 4°C), physical risks mapped, carbon price $50-200/tonne
Integration: ESG risks #3, #8, #14 in top enterprise risks, quarterly board review
Mitigation: $60M investment over 5 years in emissions reduction, safety, resilience
```

### Example 2: Technology Company ESG Risk Assessment
```
Company: SaaS company ($800M ARR, 3,500 employees, cloud-based)
Top 5 ESG Risks:
1. Data breach/privacy (Critical): High cyber threat, GDPR/CCPA exposure
2. Scope 3 emissions - cloud (High): 90% of footprint, cloud provider reliance
3. AI ethics (Medium-High): Algorithmic bias risk, emerging regulation
4. Talent (High): Competitive market, purpose-driven talent expectations
5. Greenwashing (Medium): Sustainability marketing claims, substantiation needed

Climate: Low physical risk (no assets), transition risk via cloud (Scope 3), opportunity in sustainable product features
Integration: Risk #2 (data) in top 5 enterprise risks, monthly cybersecurity review
Mitigation: $15M cybersecurity investment, cloud decarbonization partnerships, AI ethics board
```

### Example 3: Retail Company ESG Risk Assessment
```
Company: Omnichannel retailer ($4B revenue, 600 stores, 18,000 employees)
Top 5 ESG Risks:
1. Supply chain labor (Critical): Complex supply chain, labor abuse allegations risk
2. Scope 3 emissions - products (High): 85% of footprint in supply chain
3. Workplace safety - stores (Medium): Customer/employee safety incidents
4. Product sustainability (High): Consumer demand shift, greenwashing risk
5. Store closures - community impact (Medium): Economic impact on communities

Focus: Supply chain transparency (tier 1&2), sustainable products (30% by 2030), living wage
Integration: Supply chain risk #5 overall, monthly supplier risk review
Mitigation: $20M in supplier audits/capability, sustainable sourcing, circular products
```

## Best Practices

### Risk Identification
1. **Comprehensive scan** - Look across E, S, G and full value chain
2. **Stakeholder input** - Ask what keeps them up at night
3. **Peer learning** - Study ESG incidents at competitors
4. **Forward-looking** - Emerging risks, not just current
5. **Use frameworks** - SASB, TCFD provide structured approach

### Risk Assessment
1. **Quantify when possible** - Financial impact, not just qualitative
2. **Multiple time horizons** - Short, medium, long-term view
3. **Climate scenarios** - Use IPCC scenarios for climate risks
4. **Cascading impacts** - First-order and second-order effects
5. **Geographic specificity** - Risks vary by location

### Risk Prioritization
1. **Risk materiality** - Focus on what matters financially
2. **Double materiality** - Also what we impact on world (CSRD)
3. **Stakeholder salience** - What stakeholders care about most
4. **Management capacity** - Can only address so many priorities
5. **Dynamic reassessment** - Risks evolve, reprioritize regularly

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Clear ownership** - Every risk has an executive owner
2. **Resourced plans** - Not just aspirations, funded actions
3. **Timeline-bound** - When will mitigation be completed
4. **KRIs for monitoring** - Leading indicators of risk increasing
5. **Residual risk acceptance** - Senior management/board sign-off

### ERM Integration
1. **Single framework** - ESG risks assessed same as other risks
2. **Not separate** - ESG integrated into enterprise risk register
3. **CRO engagement** - Risk management owns integration
4. **Business unit ownership** - Not just sustainability team's job
5. **Board oversight** - ESG risks visible to full board, not just ESG committee

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Superficial risk lists** - Generic risks copied from frameworks without specificity
✅ Instead: Company-specific risks with quantified impacts and clear ownership

❌ **Qualitative only** - No financial quantification of risk exposure
✅ Instead: Quantify risks in financial terms ($ impact) when possible

❌ **ESG silo** - Risk assessment by sustainability team alone, isolated from ERM
✅ Instead: Integrated into ERM with CRO involvement and business unit ownership

❌ **Climate tunnel vision** - Only assessing climate, ignoring social and governance risks
✅ Instead: Comprehensive ESG risk assessment across all categories

❌ **Short-term only** - Focusing on immediate risks, missing long-term threats
✅ Instead: Multiple time horizons (short, medium, long-term) especially for climate

❌ **Static assessment** - Risk assessment as one-time exercise
✅ Instead: Continuous monitoring with KRIs and regular reassessment

❌ **No mitigation** - Identifying risks without action plans
✅ Instead: Every priority risk has mitigation plan with owner, timeline, budget

❌ **Disclosure-driven** - Only doing risk assessment for reporting requirements
✅ Instead: Risk assessment drives strategy and operational decisions

❌ **No scenarios** - Single forecast of future without considering alternatives
✅ Instead: Scenario analysis (especially for climate) to test strategy resilience

❌ **Ignoring Scope 3** - Only assessing direct operations (Scope 1&2 emissions), missing 80% of footprint
✅ Instead: Value chain risks including Scope 3, supply chain, product use
