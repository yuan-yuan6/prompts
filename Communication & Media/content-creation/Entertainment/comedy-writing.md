## Template

Conduct a comprehensive comedy writing readiness assessment for {COMEDIAN_CONTEXT} creating {COMEDY_SCOPE} to achieve {PERFORMANCE_OBJECTIVES}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5 for craft maturity:

**1. Joke Mechanics & Structure Readiness**
Evaluate the technical foundation of humor construction by examining whether setup-punchline architecture establishes clear premises providing sufficient context for audiences to understand baseline assumptions before subverting them, determining whether misdirection techniques guide audience expectations toward logical conclusions before delivering unexpected twists that reframe the setup, assessing whether surprise elements create genuine shock through contrast between anticipated outcomes and actual punchlines maintaining internal logic, examining whether tag development extracts additional humor from established punchlines through new angles or escalations extending laughter beyond initial payoff, determining whether callback integration creates satisfying connections referencing earlier material with context shifts rewarding attentive audiences, assessing whether rule of three patterns establish rhythmic expectations through two setup examples before delivering contrasting third element, examining whether premise density maximizes laugh opportunities per minute through efficient setup economy and multiple punchlines per topic, and determining whether joke variations explore different angles on same observation creating backup options when primary punchlines underperform.

**2. Comedic Voice Development Readiness**
Evaluate the authenticity and distinctiveness of comedic persona by examining whether unique perspective offers fresh angles on common observations avoiding hack premises that audiences have heard repeatedly, determining whether authentic vulnerability shares genuine struggles and insecurities without self-pity that alienates audiences or undermines stage authority, assessing whether observational acuity identifies absurdities in everyday life that others overlook with keen eye for human behavior contradictions and social conventions, examining whether persona consistency maintains recognizable character across diverse material with coherent worldview and values even when topics vary widely, determining whether point of view filters all observations through distinctive lens whether cynical realist, bemused innocent, or righteous critic creating signature comedic approach, assessing whether personal truth grounds material in lived experience even when exaggerated preventing generic borrowed observations that lack authenticity, examining whether likability factor creates audience connection despite potentially abrasive content through underlying humanity and relatability, and determining whether voice evolution accommodates growth while maintaining core identity allowing comedic persona to mature without losing established audience connection.

**3. Timing & Performance Readiness**
Evaluate the mastery of comedic delivery and stage craft by examining whether beat placement positions pauses strategically before punchlines building anticipation and after punchlines allowing laughter to peak fully, determining whether rhythm variation alternates between rapid-fire sequences and deliberate builds preventing monotonous pacing that causes audience fatigue, assessing whether pause utilization creates tension through strategic silence amplifying punchlines and allowing audiences to process multi-layered jokes, examining whether pacing control matches material intensity with faster delivery for observational lists and slower timing for story-based emotional comedy, determining whether momentum building chains related jokes creating escalating laughter where each laugh triggers readiness for the next, assessing whether physical performance integrates gestures, facial expressions, and movement enhancing verbal comedy without overwhelming it, examining whether vocal dynamics employ volume variation, character voices, and tonal shifts maintaining audience engagement through sensory variety, and determining whether audience reading skills adapt delivery based on crowd energy with flexibility to adjust pacing when material struggles or accelerate when killing.

**4. Audience Connection Readiness**
Evaluate the depth of audience understanding and cultural awareness by examining whether demographic analysis identifies specific audience characteristics including age, cultural background, values, and humor preferences informing material selection, determining whether shared reference utilization taps collective knowledge of pop culture, current events, and common experiences creating instant recognition and relatability, assessing whether cultural sensitivity navigates diverse audiences with awareness of varying perspectives avoiding assumptions of homogeneous viewpoints that alienate segments, examining whether universal theme integration balances specific observational details with broadly relatable human experiences ensuring accessibility beyond narrow demographics, determining whether taboo navigation judges audience boundaries for edgy material testing limits without crossing lines that damage rapport or trigger walkouts, assessing whether inclusive approach considers diverse perspectives within audiences avoiding material that marginalizes or excludes significant groups unnecessarily, examining whether local adaptation customizes references and examples for specific venues and regions without losing core material effectiveness, and determining whether feedback integration incorporates audience response patterns refining material based on what consistently lands versus what reliably dies.

**5. Format Versatility Readiness**
Evaluate the adaptability across comedy platforms and structures by examining whether standup set construction follows proper arc with strong opening capturing attention within first minute, middle development building momentum through thematic connections, and powerful closer leaving lasting impression, determining whether sketch comedy structure executes premise establishment, escalating absurdity, and satisfying button within tight time constraints avoiding meandering scenes, assessing whether social media optimization adapts content for platform algorithms and user behaviors with appropriate length, format, and engagement hooks for TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube, examining whether dialogue writing for sketches creates distinct character voices with natural conversation rhythms avoiding on-the-nose exposition or theatrical unrealism, determining whether visual comedy integration adds physical humor, sight gags, and facial expressions for video formats while maintaining verbal humor strength, assessing whether improvisational skills enable crowd work, spontaneous callbacks, and real-time material adjustment based on unexpected situations, examining whether collaborative writing participates effectively in writer's rooms with ability to pitch, build on others' ideas, and accept feedback professionally, and determining whether format translation converts standup bits into sketch premises, tweets into video concepts, or personal stories into character-driven scenes.

**6. Professional Standards Readiness**
Evaluate the commitment to ethical comedy and career sustainability by examining whether punching-up philosophy consistently targets those with power and privilege rather than vulnerable populations creating social commentary without bullying, determining whether stereotype elimination removes lazy characterizations based on protected classes replacing offensive tropes with original observations about actual behavior, assessing whether originality discipline creates fresh material rather than repeating common premises with proper attribution when building on others' concepts and zero plagiarism tolerance, examining whether legal awareness respects intellectual property rights, defamation boundaries, and contractual obligations avoiding material creating liability for performers or venues, determining whether content rating adherence matches promised cleanliness level delivering PG material when contracted or warning audiences before adult content, assessing whether trauma sensitivity handles heavy topics including violence, abuse, and loss with appropriate framing acknowledging pain without exploitation for cheap shock laughs, examining whether feedback receptivity accepts criticism on problematic material with willingness to revise or retire bits that miss the mark rather than defensive doubling down, and determining whether career strategy balances artistic integrity with professional relationships maintaining reputation while taking calculated creative risks that advance craft.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Open Mic Comedian Building First Tight Five

**Context:** New comedian with 8 months open mic experience, entertaining stage presence with funny stories but jokes lack structure resulting in inconsistent laughs and inability to book showcase spots.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Overall Score: 2.3/5 (Developing)** - Natural performer with good instincts but weak technical joke construction
- **Dimension Scores:** Joke Mechanics 1.9 (premises unclear, punchlines weak), Comedic Voice 3.2 (authentic and likable), Timing & Performance 2.6 (instinctive but unrefined), Audience Connection 2.8 (relates well), Format Versatility 1.8 (only does standup), Professional Standards 3.0 (good boundaries)

**Key Gaps:**
1. **Setup-punchline structure deficiency** - Stories ramble without clear destinations providing laughs from personality and energy rather than actual jokes, premises establish situations but don't deliver surprise twists, missing 4-5 laugh opportunities per minute that structured material would generate, needs to identify "game" in each premise and heighten it deliberately
2. **Tag absence** - Gets initial laugh then immediately moves to next topic leaving comedic value untapped, not recognizing when audiences want more exploration of funny premise, should extract 2-3 additional laughs per solid punchline through tags before moving on
3. **Set structure missing** - Five minutes feels like random story collection without intentional arc, no strong opener establishing presence quickly, no callbacks creating cohesion, transitions feel abrupt rather than smooth

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate (Week 1-2):** Watch 5 comedy specials with notebook identifying every setup-punchline-tag sequence writing down the pattern, select best story from current material and rewrite with 6 clear punchlines instead of rambling narrative, practice tagging drill where every punchline must generate 3 different tag options before moving to next premise
- **Short-term (Week 3-6):** Build 5-minute set with intentional structure: killer opener (30 seconds), 3 developed bits with multiple tags each (4 minutes), strong closer with callback (30 seconds), record all performances analyzing which specific jokes land versus die, implement joke density target of 3-4 laughs per minute measuring against recordings
- **Medium-term (Week 7-12):** Establish daily writing routine creating 5 new joke attempts from observations even if bad because volume breeds quality, attend comedy workshop or class for systematic joke construction training, perform 4-5 times weekly to rapidly test material identifying patterns, study specific techniques weekly (callbacks, act-outs, rule of three) implementing deliberately in new material

**Expected Outcomes:** Reach 3.6/5 overall within 12 weeks with Joke Mechanics improving dramatically (1.9→3.7) through structured practice, Format Versatility advancing (1.8→3.0) through set construction, generating consistent 3-4 laughs per minute qualifying for booked showcase spots beyond open mics and first paid bookings.

### Example 2: Sketch Writer Expanding Beyond Solo Videos

**Context:** YouTube sketch creator with 25K subscribers making funny solo videos but struggling with ensemble dynamics, dialogue writing, and collaborative development for sketch team.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Overall Score: 3.1/5 (Proficient)** - Strong concept development but execution gaps in collaboration
- **Dimension Scores:** Joke Mechanics 3.3 (good premises), Comedic Voice 3.7 (distinctive online persona), Timing & Performance 2.7 (writing doesn't account for performance), Audience Connection 3.2 (knows demographic), Format Versatility 3.0 (sketch-focused), Professional Standards 3.0 (solid ethics)

**Key Gaps:**
1. **Dialogue naturalism weakness** - Characters speak in paragraphs with unnatural formality rather than conversational fragments, missing subtext where meaning differs from literal words, every joke spelled out explicitly rather than discovered through character conflict, needs to transcribe real conversations studying rhythm and interruption patterns
2. **Scene economy issues** - Sketches run 5-7 minutes when premise exhausts after 2-3 minutes, doesn't recognize diminishing returns continuing past natural conclusion, missing "game" escalation that creates momentum toward clear button ending
3. **Collaborative resistance** - Writing in isolation protecting every line rather than allowing performers to improve material through improvisation, missing ensemble dynamics that create organic comedy, not understanding writer's room culture

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate (Week 1-2):** Join local sketch team or improv group experiencing collaborative process firsthand, record and transcribe 10 real conversations analyzing how people actually talk with fragments, pauses, and topic shifts, rewrite best sketch cutting runtime by 50% identifying essential beats versus padding
- **Short-term (Week 3-6):** Develop "rough draft to polish" process where scenes are loosely scripted allowing performers to discover funnier choices through rehearsal, analyze successful sketch shows like "Key & Peele" or "I Think You Should Leave" studying extreme economy and escalation, implement rule that every sketch must escalate absurdity three times with each beat raising stakes
- **Medium-term (Week 7-12):** Form sketch writing partnership with 2-3 collaborators pitching premises together and dividing writing assignments, establish feedback culture where all material gets punched up collectively before shooting, create production pipeline from pitch through shoot to edit understanding how each stage affects comedy timing, produce 8 sketches through full collaborative process

**Expected Outcomes:** Reach 4.0/5 overall within 12 weeks with Timing & Performance improving (2.7→3.9) through performance awareness, Format Versatility advancing (3.0→4.2) through dialogue mastery, creating shareable ensemble sketch content generating 100K+ views through tighter writing and professional collaboration skills.

### Example 3: Social Media Comedian Seeking Consistent Virality

**Context:** Digital creator with 3 viral tweets (500K+ likes each) but struggling to replicate success consistently, needs systematic comedy creation process rather than random inspiration hits.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Overall Score: 2.9/5 (Developing)** - Capable of brilliance but no reliable process
- **Dimension Scores:** Joke Mechanics 3.1 (can write funny tweets), Comedic Voice 3.6 (strong online persona), Timing & Performance 2.2 (doesn't translate to video), Audience Connection 3.3 (understands platform), Format Versatility 2.5 (format-limited), Professional Standards 2.7 (boundaries inconsistent)

**Key Gaps:**
1. **Volume consistency deficiency** - Posts 3-4 times weekly when algorithm rewards daily content, waiting for inspiration rather than systematic ideation, doesn't understand comedy is volume game where 1 in 10 hits but needs those 10 attempts, missing trending moments due to slow creation process
2. **Format limitation** - Success in text tweets but video comedy timing weak, doesn't understand how 15-second TikTok structure differs from 2-minute YouTube short versus 280-character tweet, attempting same joke across platforms without proper adaptation
3. **Monetization absence** - Viral posts build followers but no revenue strategy, missing brand partnerships, paid subscriptions, or merchandise opportunities, not converting social media success into sustainable comedy career

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate (Week 1-2):** Implement daily writing quota of 10 joke attempts per day with goal of posting best 2-3, create swipe file of trending topics and meme formats for rapid deployment when moment strikes, study 20 viral comedy accounts identifying patterns in premise selection, setup economy, and punchline construction
- **Short-term (Week 3-6):** Master one short-form video platform (TikTok or Reels) studying top creators and reverse-engineering their structures, develop 7 repeatable video formats that can be executed quickly when trends emerge, build content calendar mixing evergreen material with timely content ensuring consistent posting regardless of inspiration
- **Medium-term (Week 7-12):** Develop monetization strategy including media kit for brand deals, Patreon for exclusive content, merchandise featuring catchphrases or characters, analyze analytics deeply identifying which content types and topics drive maximum engagement for strategic focus, build email list capturing audience beyond platform algorithms for long-term career security

**Expected Outcomes:** Reach 3.9/5 overall within 12 weeks with Format Versatility improving (2.5→4.1) through video mastery, Timing & Performance advancing (2.2→3.6) through platform-specific practice, scaling to 150K+ followers with diversified revenue generating $3-7K monthly from comedy content enabling full-time pursuit.
