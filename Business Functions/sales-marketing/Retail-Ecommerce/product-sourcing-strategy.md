# Product Sourcing Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to source products reliably with the right supplier strategy, cost structure, quality controls, risk management, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess sourcing strategy readiness for [BUSINESS] sourcing [PRODUCT_CATEGORIES] from [REGIONS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Category strategy & requirements, (2) Supplier selection & negotiation, (3) Costing & margins, (4) Quality & compliance, (5) Supply risk & resilience, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Category Strategy & Requirements
- 1 — Initial: Requirements unclear; assortment decisions are reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Category goals and specs documented; demand and constraints understood.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is optimized by performance; requirements evolve with market feedback.

### 2) Supplier Selection & Negotiation
- 1 — Initial: Supplier selection ad-hoc; negotiation inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Supplier criteria; RFQ process; standard negotiation levers.
- 5 — Optimized: Supplier base is optimized; partnerships and alternatives reduce risk.

### 3) Costing & Margins
- 1 — Initial: True costs unclear; margin erosion surprises occur.
- 3 — Defined: Cost model includes landed costs; margin targets and guardrails.
- 5 — Optimized: Costs are optimized; decisions account for total value and risk.

### 4) Quality & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Quality checks inconsistent; compliance risk unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Quality standards, inspections, and documentation defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Quality system scales; defects and compliance incidents decline.

### 5) Supply Risk & Resilience
- 1 — Initial: Single points of failure; lead times unpredictable.
- 3 — Defined: Risk assessment; buffer strategy; dual sourcing where needed.
- 5 — Optimized: Resilience is engineered; disruptions are managed with minimal impact.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: KPIs inconsistent; supplier performance not tracked.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined (OTIF, defects, cost); review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves cost, quality, and reliability over time.

## Deliverables
- Sourcing readiness scorecard and gap list
- Category requirements and supplier criteria
- Cost model (landed cost) and margin guardrails
- Quality/compliance checklist and inspection plan
- Supplier KPI dashboard and improvement cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [PRODUCT_CATEGORIES]: Categories being sourced
- [REGIONS]: Sourcing regions
- [LANDED_COST]: Total landed cost
- [OTIF_TARGET]: On-time-in-full target
- [DEFECT_RATE]: Defect baseline

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Retailer expanding private label sourcing
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Suppliers 2; Costing 2; Quality 2; Risk 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define supplier criteria; build landed-cost model; implement inspections and KPI cadence
