# Regulatory Compliance Readiness Assessment - Part 3: Implementation & Reporting

## Purpose
Assess readiness to implement and sustain a compliance program across six dimensions: Audit & Testing, Issues & CAPA, Regulatory Engagement, Reporting & Dashboards, Program Delivery, and Continuous Improvement. Identify gaps and produce an execution plan that stands up to exams.

## Template

Conduct a compliance implementation and reporting readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} preparing for {EXAMS_OR_AUDITS} under {CORE_REGULATIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. AUDIT & CONTROL TESTING READINESS**
- Testing scope is defined (controls, processes, vendors)
- Test procedures are consistent and repeatable
- Evidence standards exist (what is sufficient, where stored)
- QA exists for testing quality and conclusions
- Findings are tracked and reported with severity

**2. ISSUE MANAGEMENT & CAPA READINESS**
- Issue classification exists (severity, regulatory exposure, customer impact)
- Root cause analysis is consistent
- Remediation plans have owners, milestones, and validation
- Closure criteria exist (fix implemented + effectiveness verified)
- Recurrence tracking exists (repeat issues trigger systemic fixes)

**3. REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT & EXAM READINESS**
- Exam playbook exists (who responds, approvals, timelines)
- Evidence retrieval is fast and consistent
- Regulatory reporting obligations are mapped and owned
- Communications are coordinated (legal, compliance, execs)
- Commitments to regulators are tracked to closure

**4. REPORTING, DASHBOARDS & METRICS READINESS**
- KPIs/KRIs are defined with calculation sources and owners
- Dashboards support different audiences (ops vs exec vs board)
- Metrics are trusted (data quality and definitions controlled)
- Reporting cadence exists (weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- Metrics drive decisions (priorities, resourcing, remediation)

**5. PROGRAM DELIVERY & CHANGE MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Implementation roadmap exists with milestones and dependencies
- Governance cadence exists (steering, workstreams, escalation)
- Stakeholder management and communications are planned
- Training and adoption are built into delivery
- Tooling and process changes are validated before rollout

**6. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT & SUSTAINABILITY READINESS**
- Findings drive updates to policies, monitoring, and training
- Post-mortems and lessons learned are standard practice
- Documentation stays current (not a one-time project)
- Vendor/third-party oversight loops into monitoring and contracts
- Improvement backlog is prioritized and delivered

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 execution priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **CAPA PIPELINE VIEW** - Severity, owners, dates, validation status
4. **EXAM READINESS CHECKLIST** - Evidence inventory, owners, response workflow
5. **DASHBOARD SPEC** - KPIs/KRIs with definitions, sources, owners, cadence
6. **90-DAY PLAN** - Highest-impact actions for audit discipline, CAPA rigor, and reporting

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (reactive remediation, weak evidence, inconsistent reporting)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic audits and issues tracking, inconsistent validation)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable testing, owned CAPA, standard reporting)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured performance, strong exam readiness, durable fixes)
- 5.0: Optimized (continuous improvement with reliable outcomes and low recurrence)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "Consumer Lending Platform" |
| `[EXAMS_OR_AUDITS]` | Upcoming exams/audits | "Annual regulatory exam + SOC review" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "UDAAP, privacy, AML" |

## Example

**FinTech - Exam Preparation**

> Assess compliance implementation readiness for **Consumer Lending Platform** preparing for **annual regulatory exam + SOC review** under **UDAAP, privacy, AML**. Testing exists but evidence standards vary; CAPA tracking exists but validation is inconsistent; regulator inquiry responses are slow due to scattered documentation; dashboards exist but definitions and data sources aren’t controlled; implementation work is project-based without steady governance cadence; lessons learned aren’t systematically fed back into monitoring and training. Provide scorecard and a 90-day plan focused on evidence standards, CAPA validation, and exam readiness.
