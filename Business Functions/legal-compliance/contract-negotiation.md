# Contract Negotiation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to negotiate contracts effectively across six dimensions: Objectives & BATNA, Positions & Fallbacks, Stakeholders & Authority, Process & Hygiene, Risk/Compliance Alignment, and Closing & Handover. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce a negotiation plan and positions matrix.

## Template

Conduct a contract negotiation readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} negotiating a {CONTRACT_TYPE} with {COUNTERPARTY}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. OBJECTIVES & BATNA READINESS**
- Clear negotiation objectives (business outcomes + legal risk constraints)
- Must-haves vs tradeables defined (prioritized)
- Walk-away points and BATNA defined and credible
- Timeline constraints and consequences understood
- Relationship goals clarified (transactional vs strategic partnership)
- Internal alignment before first redline (avoid contradictory messages)

**2. POSITIONS, FALLBACKS & CONCESSIONS READINESS**
- Positions matrix exists (preferred/fallback/walk-away) for key clauses
- Concession strategy defined (what to trade for what)
- Clause library available with alternative language
- Commercial/legal linkage understood (pricing, term, scope tied to risk)
- Approval thresholds defined (what requires exec / risk / privacy sign-off)
- “Non-standard” clause handling defined (log, rationale, approvals)

**3. STAKEHOLDERS, ROLES & AUTHORITY READINESS**
- Negotiation lead defined and trained
- Legal, finance, security/privacy SMEs engaged at the right times
- Authority matrix documented (who can approve which concessions)
- Escalation path is fast and predictable
- Counterparty stakeholder map exists (decision makers, counsel, influencers)
- Internal comms cadence defined (updates, decisions, action log)

**4. PROCESS, CADENCE & HYGIENE READINESS**
- Single source of truth for redlines (version control and naming conventions)
- Issues list tracked (open items, owners, status, next action)
- Meeting cadence aligned to timeline and complexity
- Decision log maintained (what was agreed, by whom, when)
- Redline quality discipline (clear rationale; avoid contradictory edits)
- Documentation completeness checks (exhibits, definitions, cross-references)

**5. RISK, COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT**
- Risk appetite translated into negotiating guardrails (caps, carve-outs, indemnities)
- Privacy/security requirements are measurable (standards, evidence, timelines)
- Regulatory constraints understood (sector-specific, export controls, sanctions as relevant)
- Third-party/subcontractor flow-down stance defined
- Auditability and evidence requirements considered during negotiation
- Governance aligned (who owns post-signature obligations and oversight)

**6. CLOSING, EXECUTION & HANDOVER READINESS**
- Closing checklist exists (final package completeness, exhibits, signatures)
- Final approvals captured and stored (incl. exceptions)
- Open items resolved or explicitly documented (side letters avoided)
- Post-signature handover defined (obligations, SLAs, renewals, notices)
- Implementation kickoff readiness (owners, timelines, reporting)
- Lessons learned captured for playbook and template updates

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 readiness gaps

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **POSITIONS MATRIX** - Preferred/fallback/walk-away for top clauses (liability, IP, privacy, termination)

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions

5. **NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOK** - Concession plan, escalation thresholds, and closing checklist

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Cycle time, escalations, exception rate, rework loops, outcomes achieved

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (reactive, inconsistent outcomes)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic prep, frequent escalation)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable process, clear authority)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined playbooks, measured throughput and risk outcomes)
- 5.0: Optimized (fast, consistent negotiation with continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Negotiating organization | "NorthBridge Payments" |
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "Enterprise SaaS agreement" |
| `[COUNTERPARTY]` | Counterparty | "CloudMetrics, Inc." |

## Example

**FinTech - Enterprise SaaS**

> Assess contract negotiation readiness for **NorthBridge Payments** negotiating **enterprise SaaS agreement** with **CloudMetrics, Inc.** (1) Objectives—must-haves are clear, but walk-away points aren’t agreed. (2) Positions—liability and privacy positions exist, but fallbacks are undocumented; concessions are ad-hoc. (3) Authority—security and privacy SMEs are pulled in late; escalation is slow. (4) Process—multiple redline versions circulate; no single issues list exists. (5) Risk/compliance—security commitments are vague and not tied to evidence; audit rights are unclear. (6) Closing—final package and handover to contract ops is inconsistent. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a playbook with a positions matrix and closing checklist.
