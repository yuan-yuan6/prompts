# Usability Testing & Validation Plan

## Purpose
Create comprehensive usability testing plans to validate design decisions, identify usability issues, and gather user feedback for iterative improvement of digital products.

## Quick Start

**Run Your First Usability Test in 2 Hours**

1. **Pick ONE Thing to Test** (10 min): What's your biggest design question or concern?
2. **Find 3-5 Users** (20 min): Friends, colleagues, or target users - anyone who fits your audience
3. **Write 3 Tasks** (15 min): "Try to [specific action]" - keep them realistic and clear
4. **Test & Observe** (60 min): Watch them try, DON'T help, take notes on struggles
5. **Quick Debrief** (15 min): Ask "What was confusing?" and "What worked well?"

**Minimal Viable Test**:
- **Who**: 5 users (you'll find 80% of issues)
- **What**: 3 core tasks (start small!)
- **How**: Watch + take notes (video is nice but not essential)
- **Output**: List of top 3 problems to fix

**Pro Tip**: Silence is your friend. When they struggle, wait 10 seconds before helping!

SAMPLE_SIZE: "30 participants"
SESSION_DURATION: "30 minutes"
```

### Example 3: SaaS Feature Validation

```

## Best Practices

1. **Test early and often** - Don't wait for perfection to start testing
2. **Focus on realistic tasks** - Use scenarios based on actual use cases
3. **Recruit representative users** - Test with people who match your target audience
4. **Keep tasks independent** - Don't let one task influence another
5. **Remain neutral** - Don't lead participants or defend the design
6. **Observe, don't explain** - Let users struggle to identify real issues
7. **Record sessions** - Capture video for later analysis and stakeholder review
8. **Test with 5-8 users** - Most issues surface with this sample size
9. **Prioritize findings** - Focus on high-impact, high-frequency issues
10. **Close the loop** - Share results and show how feedback influenced design

## Tips for Success

- Run a pilot test to refine your tasks and questions
- Prepare backup tasks in case sessions run short
- Have troubleshooting plans for technical issues
- Create highlight reels to share compelling moments
- Use verbatim quotes to bring findings to life
- Calculate metrics consistently across all sessions
- Document both successes and failures
- Test with accessibility tools if targeting inclusive design
- Compare results to benchmarks or previous versions
- Plan follow-up testing to validate improvements
