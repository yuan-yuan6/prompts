# Publication Preparation Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive manuscripts, abstracts, posters, and presentations for medical publications including journal articles, conference materials, and scientific communications following publication guidelines and standards.

## Quick Start

### For Original Research Manuscript
1. Select target journal: Match study design/impact to journal scope and IF
2. Follow reporting guidelines: CONSORT (RCTs), STROBE (observational), PRISMA (reviews)
3. Structure manuscript: IMRaD format with word limits (typically 3000-4000 words)
4. Prepare tables/figures: 4-6 total, ensure they stand alone with clear legends
5. Check author contributions: Verify all meet ICMJE criteria (conception, drafting, approval)

### For Conference Abstract
1. Review guidelines: Character/word limits (typically 250-400 words), structure requirements
2. Write concisely: Background (2-3 sentences) → Methods (brief) → Results (quantitative) → Conclusions
3. Include key numbers: Sample size, primary outcome with effect size and p-value
4. Proofread carefully: Errors highly visible in abstract books and online
5. Submit early: Deadlines often 6-8 months before conference

### Publication Ethics Checklist
- **Authorship**: All authors meet ICMJE criteria, none excluded who qualify
- **Conflicts of interest**: Disclose all financial relationships in past 3 years
- **Prior publication**: Not submitted elsewhere simultaneously (duplicate publication)
- **Data sharing**: Provide statement on availability per ICMJE/journal requirements
- **Trial registration**: Prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional studies
- **Ethics approval**: IRB approval obtained, consent processes followed
- **Reporting guidelines**: CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA/CARE checklist completed

### Response to Peer Review
1. Thank editor/reviewers: Acknowledge constructive feedback professionally
2. Point-by-point response: Address every comment with specific location of changes
3. Track changes: Highlight modifications in revised manuscript for easy review
4. Provide additional analyses: If requested, include in supplementary materials
5. Remain professional: Even if reviewer comments seem harsh or uninformed

### Cover Letter Essentials
- State manuscript type and title
- Explain significance and novelty (2-3 sentences)
- Confirm no conflicts, ethical approval, author agreement
- Suggest 3-5 potential reviewers with emails (optional but helpful)
- Note any prior presentation at conferences
