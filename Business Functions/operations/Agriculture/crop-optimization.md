# Crop Optimization Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to optimize crop yield and input efficiency using agronomic practices, data, and (optionally) predictive analytics.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess readiness to optimize crop outcomes for [CROP] in region [REGION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goals & constraints, (2) Data & sensing, (3) Agronomy practices, (4) Modeling/analytics, (5) Execution & operations, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard and a seasonal plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goals & Constraints
- 1 — Initial: Goals unclear; constraints not captured.
- 3 — Defined: Yield/quality and cost constraints defined; tradeoffs documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Goals align to economics and sustainability; constraints managed explicitly.

### 2) Data & Sensing
- 1 — Initial: Field data is sparse; data quality unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Key data sources identified; collection and QA processes exist.
- 5 — Optimized: High-quality, timely data supports decisions and learning loops.

### 3) Agronomy Practices
- 1 — Initial: Practices are inconsistent; limited standardization.
- 3 — Defined: Standard practices and protocols defined; local adaptation documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Practices are optimized and validated; variability managed effectively.

### 4) Modeling & Analytics
- 1 — Initial: No baselines; insights are anecdotal.
- 3 — Defined: Baselines and simple models used; assumptions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Models are validated and updated; recommendations are trustworthy.

### 5) Execution & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Plans are ad-hoc; execution varies by operator.
- 3 — Defined: Operational plans, schedules, and responsibilities defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is reliable; deviations are tracked and corrected quickly.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: Outcomes not measured consistently.
- 3 — Defined: Measurement plan and post-season review process exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement is systematic with experiment-like rigor.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard and seasonal risk register
- Field data and sensing plan
- Standard operating practices and schedule
- Analytics baseline and recommendation approach
- Measurement plan and post-season review template

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [CROP]: Crop type
- [REGION]: Region
- [SEASON]: Season window
- [INPUTS]: Key inputs (water, fertilizer, labor)
- [CONSTRAINTS]: Constraints (budget, water limits)
- [TARGETS]: Yield/quality targets

## Example (Condensed)
- Crop: Corn in Region X; season April–September
- Scores (1–5): Goals 3; Data 2; Practices 3; Analytics 2; Ops 3; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Improve field data capture; establish baselines; standardize schedules; define measurement and review cadence
