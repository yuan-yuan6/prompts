# AI UX & Interaction Design Template

## Purpose
Design intuitive, trustworthy user experiences for AI-powered features that manage user expectations, handle uncertainty gracefully, and build confidence in AI capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
```
AI Feature: Document summarization
UX Pattern: AI Enhancement

User Flow:
1. User uploads document → Shows "Analyzing..." (10-15 sec estimate)
2. AI generates summary → Displays with confidence indicator
3. User reviews → Can regenerate, edit, or accept
4. Provide feedback → Thumbs up/down for future improvement

Key UX Principles:
- Show AI is working (progress indicator)
- Manage expectations (estimated time)
- Give control (edit, regenerate)
- Be transparent (confidence score)
- Learn from feedback (improvement loop)
```

### When to Use This
- Designing any AI-powered feature or product
- Improving existing AI feature usability
- Building user trust in AI capabilities
- Handling AI errors and edge cases
- Creating consistent AI interaction patterns

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Choose AI Pattern** - Select appropriate interaction pattern for your AI feature
2. **Design States** - Plan loading, success, error, and edge case states
3. **Build Trust** - Add transparency, explanations, and control mechanisms
4. **Handle Uncertainty** - Design for AI mistakes, low confidence, errors
