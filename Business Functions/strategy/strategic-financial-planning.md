# Financial Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to produce decision-grade budgets, forecasts, and investment plans reliably and repeatably. Use this assessment to prioritize improvements in data, modeling, cadence, governance, and decision support.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess financial planning readiness for [ORGANIZATION] in [INDUSTRY] over a [PLANNING_HORIZON] horizon. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Data & assumptions, (2) Modeling & tooling, (3) Planning process & cadence, (4) Governance & decision rights, (5) Talent & operating model, (6) Performance management & communication. Provide a scorecard with brief evidence, the top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Data & Assumptions
- 1 — Initial: Data is fragmented; assumptions are implicit, inconsistent, or undocumented; definitions vary by team.
- 3 — Defined: Core datasets and drivers are standardized; assumptions are documented and reviewed; basic sensitivity checks exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Assumptions are governed with clear ownership; driver library is reused across models; leading indicators continuously refresh assumptions.

### 2) Modeling & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Spreadsheet-heavy with brittle links; limited scenarios; unclear versioning and weak audit trail.
- 3 — Defined: Standard templates/models; scenario toggles; input controls and basic versioning practices are in place.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular driver-based models; rapid scenario analysis; integrated planning tooling where useful; reproducible results with strong auditability.

### 3) Planning Process & Cadence
- 1 — Initial: Ad-hoc planning; frequent rework; slow cycles; unclear handoffs and deadlines.
- 3 — Defined: Documented calendar; structured cross-functional inputs; cycle time targets; retrospectives improve each cycle.
- 5 — Optimized: Rolling forecast discipline; event-driven reforecasting; minimal rework via clear standards and automated validation.

### 4) Governance & Decision Rights
- 1 — Initial: Approval paths are unclear; investment decisions are inconsistent; tradeoffs surface late.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights and thresholds are explicit; capital allocation criteria are documented; exceptions have clear escalation.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance is fast and predictable; portfolio-based capital allocation; feedback loops improve next-cycle assumptions.

### 5) Talent & Operating Model
- 1 — Initial: FP&A is under-resourced; unclear responsibilities; business partners lack planning fundamentals.
- 3 — Defined: Clear FP&A roles; business partnering model exists; training and standards support consistent analysis.
- 5 — Optimized: Strong analytical depth and business partnership; automation frees time for decision support and strategic tradeoffs.

### 6) Performance Management & Communication
- 1 — Initial: KPIs are inconsistent; variance analysis is reactive; narratives are not trusted.
- 3 — Defined: KPI glossary; recurring variance routines; standardized narratives; action tracking exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Tight insight-to-action loop; leading indicators monitored; communications are concise, comparable, and decision-oriented.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence-based notes per dimension
- Top gaps ranked by impact and urgency
- Recommended standards (drivers, KPI definitions, modeling conventions)
- 90-day improvement plan (people, process, data, tooling)
- Success metrics (cycle time, forecast accuracy, variance closure rate)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [PLANNING_HORIZON]: Planning horizon (e.g., 12 months, 3 years)
- [REPORTING_CURRENCY]: Currency for reporting and consolidation
- [REVENUE_STREAMS]: Major revenue drivers/streams
- [COST_DRIVERS]: Major cost categories and drivers
- [CAPEX_AREAS]: Investment areas (product, systems, facilities, M&A)
- [SCENARIOS]: Scenario set (base/upside/downside; triggers and assumptions)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Regional manufacturer planning a 12-month rolling forecast plus annual budget
- Scores (1–5): Data & Assumptions 2; Modeling & Tooling 2; Process & Cadence 3; Governance 2; Talent 3; Performance Mgmt 2
- Top gaps: Unowned assumptions, inconsistent KPI definitions, spreadsheet sprawl, late-stage investment tradeoffs
- 90-day priorities: Define driver library and KPI glossary; implement model versioning controls; establish capital approval thresholds; tighten calendar and handoffs
