# Site Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to evaluate a site for development or acquisition with disciplined due diligence, risk assessment, and decision-grade outputs.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess site analysis readiness for [SITE] intended for [PROJECT_TYPE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Scope & criteria, (2) Zoning/permitting, (3) Environmental/physical due diligence, (4) Financial feasibility, (5) Risk & stakeholder management, (6) Reporting & decision process. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a due diligence plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Criteria
- 1 — Initial: Criteria unclear; evaluation is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Selection criteria documented; checklist and thresholds defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Criteria are tuned by outcomes; evaluations are repeatable and fast.

### 2) Zoning/Permitting
- 1 — Initial: Zoning unknown; permitting path unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Zoning analysis and permitting requirements documented; timeline estimates.
- 5 — Optimized: Permitting risks are managed proactively; relationships and processes are established.

### 3) Environmental/Physical Due Diligence
- 1 — Initial: Limited inspections; unknown site constraints.
- 3 — Defined: Standard due diligence scope; inspections and reports; findings tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Due diligence is comprehensive and efficient; risks identified early.

### 4) Financial Feasibility
- 1 — Initial: Cost/revenue assumptions unclear; sensitivity missing.
- 3 — Defined: Feasibility model with documented assumptions; scenarios.
- 5 — Optimized: Modeling is calibrated; decisions account for constraints and risk.

### 5) Risk & Stakeholder Management
- 1 — Initial: Stakeholders not mapped; risks not tracked.
- 3 — Defined: Stakeholder plan; risk register; mitigation actions.
- 5 — Optimized: Risks are actively managed; escalations are fast and predictable.

### 6) Reporting & Decision Process
- 1 — Initial: Outputs aren’t decision-grade; approvals unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Standard report format; decision rights and review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Decisions are fast and auditable; learnings improve future evaluations.

## Deliverables
- Site analysis readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Due diligence checklist and timeline
- Zoning/permitting memo
- Feasibility model with scenarios
- Risk register and stakeholder engagement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [SITE]: Address/parcels
- [PROJECT_TYPE]: Development type
- [ZONING]: Zoning designation
- [TIMELINE]: Due diligence timeline
- [CAPEX]: Estimated capex
- [REVENUE_MODEL]: Rent/sales assumptions

## Example (Condensed)
- Site: Mixed-use infill development
- Scores (1–5): Criteria 3; Zoning 2; Due diligence 2; Feasibility 2; Risk 2; Decision 3
- 90-day priorities: Standardize due diligence checklist; formalize feasibility modeling; implement risk register and governance cadence
