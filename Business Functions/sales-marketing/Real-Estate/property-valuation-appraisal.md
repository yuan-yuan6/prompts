# Property Valuation & Appraisal Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to value properties consistently using appropriate methods, reliable comps, defensible assumptions, and compliant documentation.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess valuation readiness for [PROPERTY] (asset type [ASSET_TYPE]) in [MARKET]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Valuation scope & standards, (2) Data & comps quality, (3) Method selection & adjustments, (4) Assumptions & documentation, (5) Review & compliance, (6) Reporting & auditability. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60-day improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Standards
- 1 — Initial: Valuation standards unclear; methods vary by analyst.
- 3 — Defined: Standard scope and method selection guidelines; documentation requirements.
- 5 — Optimized: Standards are enforced; valuations are consistent and comparable.

### 2) Data & Comps Quality
- 1 — Initial: Comps are incomplete; sources inconsistent; bias likely.
- 3 — Defined: Comps criteria defined; data sources documented; QA routines.
- 5 — Optimized: Comps database is maintained; data quality monitored and trusted.

### 3) Method Selection & Adjustments
- 1 — Initial: Method selection inconsistent; adjustments not defensible.
- 3 — Defined: Methods (income/sales/cost) chosen with rationale; adjustments documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Adjustments are evidence-based; models are calibrated and repeatable.

### 4) Assumptions & Documentation
- 1 — Initial: Key assumptions undocumented; hard to audit decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Assumptions documented; sensitivity analysis included.
- 5 — Optimized: Assumptions are validated; documentation is complete and reusable.

### 5) Review & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: No review process; compliance risk unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Peer review and approval steps; compliance checklist.
- 5 — Optimized: Controls are embedded; issues are caught early; audit trail is strong.

### 6) Reporting & Auditability
- 1 — Initial: Reports vary; key drivers unclear; hard to compare.
- 3 — Defined: Standard report format with key drivers and comps support.
- 5 — Optimized: Reports are decision-grade and auditable; outcomes inform updates.

## Deliverables
- Valuation readiness scorecard and prioritized gaps
- Comps criteria and data source inventory
- Valuation method guidelines and adjustment standards
- Review/compliance checklist and workflow
- Standard valuation report format

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROPERTY]: Property identifier
- [ASSET_TYPE]: Asset type
- [MARKET]: Market
- [CAP_RATE]: Cap rate
- [NOI]: Net operating income
- [COMPS]: Comparable sales/leases

## Example (Condensed)
- Property: Industrial warehouse appraisal
- Scores (1–5): Standards 3; Data 2; Methods 2; Assumptions 2; Review 2; Reporting 3
- 60-day priorities: Build comps criteria + QA; standardize method rationale; add review workflow and report format
