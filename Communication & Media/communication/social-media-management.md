# Social Media Management & Strategy Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for developing social media presence, creating engaging content, building communities, managing multi-platform strategies, and driving business results through effective social media management and audience engagement.

## Quick Start

**Need to build social media presence quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
I'm launching a B2B SaaS startup targeting marketing professionals. I need to build social media presence on LinkedIn and Twitter to generate awareness, share product updates, engage with potential customers, and drive sign-ups for our beta launch in 3 months.
```

### When to Use This
- Launching new products or services that need market awareness
- Building brand presence and community engagement from scratch
- Driving lead generation and customer acquisition through social channels
- Managing reputation and customer service across multiple platforms

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Choose Core Platforms** - Select 2-3 platforms where your target audience is most active (B2B: LinkedIn/Twitter, B2C: Instagram/TikTok, Visual: Instagram/Pinterest)
2. **Create Content Calendar** - Plan 4-5 posts per week mixing educational content (40%), company updates (30%), engagement posts (20%), and promotional content (10%)
3. **Engage and Optimize** - Respond to comments within 2 hours, track performance metrics weekly, and adjust content based on what drives highest engagement and conversions

**Time to complete**: 1 week for strategy setup, 2-4 weeks to establish consistent presence and initial engagement
