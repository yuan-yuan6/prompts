# Experimental Design - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This is a navigation hub for the experimental design template collection. The comprehensive experimental design template has been split into focused sub-prompts for easier use and better clarity.

## Quick Start

**Choose Your Template:**

Browse the specialized templates below and select the one that matches your specific needs. Each template is focused, easy to use, and can be applied independently.

### 1. A/B Testing & Experimentation Template
**File:** `ab-testing-experiments.md`

**Purpose:** Design and analyze A/B tests and multivariate experiments with proper randomization, statistical power, and analysis for digital products.

**Best for:** A/B Test, AB Test, Multivariate

---

### 2. Randomized Controlled Trials Template
**File:** `randomized-controlled-trials.md`

**Purpose:** Design randomized controlled trials with proper experimental protocols, treatment allocation, and causal inference analysis.

**Best for:** RCT, Randomized, Clinical Trial

---

### 3. Quasi-Experimental Design Template
**File:** `quasi-experimental-design.md`

**Purpose:** Design quasi-experimental studies including difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and propensity score matching.

**Best for:** Quasi, Difference-in-Differences, DiD

---

### 4. Causal Inference Analysis Template
**File:** `causal-inference-analysis.md`

**Purpose:** Perform causal inference using instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, synthetic controls, and advanced econometric methods.

**Best for:** Causal, Instrumental, Synthetic Control
