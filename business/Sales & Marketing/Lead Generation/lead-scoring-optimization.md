## Optimization Best Practices

1. **Measure Consistently**: Track metrics regularly and consistently
2. **Act on Data**: Make decisions based on evidence, not intuition
3. **Test Rigorously**: Use A/B testing to validate changes
4. **Iterate Continuously**: Small, frequent improvements beat big changes
5. **Involve Stakeholders**: Get input from sales, marketing, and leadership
6. **Document Changes**: Maintain detailed change log
7. **Monitor Impact**: Watch downstream effects of optimizations
8. **Stay Compliant**: Ensure changes meet regulatory requirements
