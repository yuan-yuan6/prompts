# Predictive Modeling Framework - Quick Navigation

## Purpose
Quick reference guide routing you to the appropriate template for your current predictive modeling phase.

---

## Template Selection Guide

### New to Predictive Modeling?
**Start here:** [Predictive Modeling Framework](predictive-modeling-framework.md)
- Comprehensive overview of the complete workflow
- Helps you plan your project from start to finish
- Guides you through problem definition, timeline estimation, and resource planning

### Working on Data Preparation?
**Go to:** [Data Preparation and Feature Engineering](predictive-modeling-framework-01-data-preparation.md)
- Handling missing values, outliers, and data quality issues
- Engineering features from raw data
- Encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features
- Designing train-test splits preventing data leakage

### Building and Training Models?
**Go to:** [Model Development and Evaluation](predictive-modeling-framework-02-model-development.md)
- Selecting algorithms (regression, classification, time-series)
- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance
- Building ensemble models for improved accuracy
- Evaluating models with appropriate metrics
- Balancing accuracy vs interpretability

### Deploying to Production?
**Go to:** [Model Deployment and Monitoring](predictive-modeling-framework-03-deployment.md)
- Deploying models via batch, real-time API, or streaming
- Monitoring model performance and detecting drift
- Implementing automated retraining pipelines
- Establishing governance and compliance controls

## Typical Workflow

1. **Plan** → Use [Framework Overview](predictive-modeling-framework.md) to scope project
2. **Prepare Data** → Use [Data Preparation](predictive-modeling-framework-01-data-preparation.md)
3. **Build Models** → Use [Model Development](predictive-modeling-framework-02-model-development.md)
4. **Deploy** → Use [Deployment](predictive-modeling-framework-03-deployment.md)
5. **Monitor & Iterate** → Return to steps 2-4 as needed
