# Catalog Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage product catalog data and workflows (PIM-like capabilities): data model, governance, quality, and integrations across channels.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess catalog management readiness for [BUSINESS] with [SKU_COUNT] SKUs selling on [CHANNELS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Product data model, (2) Workflow & approvals, (3) Data quality & enrichment, (4) Integrations & syndication, (5) Governance & roles, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Product Data Model
- 1 — Initial: Attributes are inconsistent; variants/bundles poorly defined.
- 3 — Defined: Standard attribute model; taxonomy; variant rules documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Model scales across markets and channels; changes are controlled and predictable.

### 2) Workflow & Approvals
- 1 — Initial: Updates are manual; ownership unclear; cycle time is unpredictable.
- 3 — Defined: Defined workflow with owners, SLAs, and approval steps.
- 5 — Optimized: Workflows are automated; throughput scales without quality loss.

### 3) Data Quality & Enrichment
- 1 — Initial: Missing attributes; weak validation; inconsistent images/descriptions.
- 3 — Defined: Validation rules; enrichment sources; QA routines.
- 5 — Optimized: Quality is monitored; enrichment is systematic; defects are prevented.

### 4) Integrations & Syndication
- 1 — Initial: Channel data is duplicated; syndication is error-prone.
- 3 — Defined: Integrations to commerce/marketplaces; reliable export formats.
- 5 — Optimized: Syndication is robust; exceptions are managed; channel requirements are versioned.

### 5) Governance & Roles
- 1 — Initial: No clear data owners; conflicts between teams.
- 3 — Defined: Data ownership and decision rights; documentation and training.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; changes are auditable; drift is minimized.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No monitoring of completeness or defects.
- 3 — Defined: Dashboards for completeness, errors, and cycle time.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement reduces defects and increases conversion.

## Deliverables
- Catalog readiness scorecard and prioritized gap list
- Product data model and taxonomy definition
- Workflow and approval map with owners and SLAs
- Quality rules and enrichment plan
- Integration/syndication plan for target channels

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Retailer/e-commerce business
- [SKU_COUNT]: Number of SKUs
- [CHANNELS]: DTC site, marketplaces, retailers, social commerce
- [ATTRIBUTE_SET]: Required attributes per category
- [DATA_SOURCES]: ERP, suppliers, DAM, PIM
- [QUALITY_TARGET]: Completeness/defect targets

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Marketplace + DTC retailer with frequent listing errors
- Scores (1–5): Model 2; Workflow 2; Quality 2; Integrations 3; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define taxonomy + required fields; implement QA rules; map workflow owners and SLAs
