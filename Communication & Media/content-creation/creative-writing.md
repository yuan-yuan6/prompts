# Creative Writing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess creative writing project readiness across six dimensions: Story Foundation, Character Development, Narrative Architecture, Writing Craft, Creative Vision, and Execution Planning. This framework identifies creative gaps, strengthens narrative elements, and creates development roadmaps for compelling fiction, scripts, poetry, and literary works.

## 🚀 Quick Writing Assessment Prompt

> Assess **creative writing readiness** for **[WRITER/TEAM]** developing **[WORK TYPE]** in **[GENRE]** targeting **[AUDIENCE]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Story foundation**—is the premise compelling with clear stakes? Do theme and setting support the narrative? (2) **Character development**—are protagonists multi-dimensional with authentic motivations? Do supporting characters serve the story? (3) **Narrative architecture**—is the plot structured with rising tension and satisfying resolution? Are pacing and scene progression effective? (4) **Writing craft**—is the prose style appropriate for genre and audience? Does dialogue reveal character? (5) **Creative vision**—is the voice distinctive? Does the work offer fresh perspective within genre conventions? Provide a readiness scorecard (1-5 per dimension), creative gaps, development priorities, and a writing plan with milestones.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid creative project evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive creative writing readiness assessment for {PROJECT_CONTEXT}, developing {CREATIVE_WORK_SCOPE} to achieve {ARTISTIC_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Story Foundation Readiness**

Assess whether core story elements provide solid narrative groundwork. Evaluate premise strength determining if the central concept is compelling, original within its genre, and capable of sustaining the intended length. Examine thematic clarity including whether underlying themes are meaningful, coherent, and explored through character and plot rather than stated explicitly. Review setting development determining whether time, place, and world-building details feel authentic, support the story's mood, and avoid info-dumping. Analyze stakes and conflict including whether what characters stand to gain or lose feels meaningful to both character and reader. Assess genre alignment determining whether story elements match audience expectations while offering fresh angles rather than cliché repetition. Evaluate central question or dramatic situation including whether the story poses compelling questions that drive reader engagement through to resolution.

**2. Character Development Readiness**

Evaluate whether characters feel authentic and drive the narrative forward. Assess protagonist dimensionality including whether main characters possess complexity beyond single traits, with contradictions and internal conflicts that feel human. Examine character motivation clarity determining whether desires, fears, and goals feel authentic and drive believable choices. Review character arc potential including whether protagonists face meaningful change, growth, or revelation earned through story events. Analyze supporting character function determining whether secondary characters serve plot advancement, thematic exploration, or protagonist development rather than existing as mere decoration. Assess relationship dynamics including whether character interactions reveal personality, create tension, and evolve organically. Evaluate voice distinctiveness determining whether each major character has recognizable speech patterns, worldviews, and decision-making styles that differentiate them.

**3. Narrative Architecture Readiness**

Assess whether plot structure creates satisfying story progression. Evaluate opening effectiveness including whether the first pages establish voice, introduce compelling questions, and hook readers emotionally or intellectually. Examine rising action design determining whether complications escalate tension, each scene advances plot or character, and momentum builds toward climax. Review climax positioning including whether the moment of highest tension arrives at appropriate story position with stakes that feel earned. Analyze resolution satisfaction determining whether endings provide closure on central questions while honoring story tone and genre expectations. Assess subplot integration including whether secondary storylines complement rather than distract from main narrative and resolve appropriately. Evaluate pacing variation determining whether scene length, chapter breaks, and narrative speed create rhythm that sustains engagement without drag or whiplash.

**4. Writing Craft Readiness**

Evaluate technical execution and prose quality. Assess point-of-view consistency including whether narrative perspective serves the story, maintains clarity, and handles shifts deliberately. Examine prose style appropriateness determining whether sentence structure, vocabulary, and rhythm match genre conventions and target audience sophistication. Review dialogue authenticity including whether character speech reveals personality, advances plot, and avoids on-the-nose exposition. Analyze show-versus-tell balance determining whether sensory details and character actions convey emotion and information more than narrative explanation. Assess descriptive effectiveness including whether imagery creates vivid mental pictures without purple prose, using concrete specific details over vague abstractions. Evaluate narrative voice distinctiveness determining whether the storytelling voice has personality appropriate to story type, with consistent tone that enhances rather than distracts from narrative.

**5. Creative Vision Readiness**

Assess originality and artistic distinctiveness of the work. Evaluate voice uniqueness including whether the narrative perspective, character worldviews, or prose style offer something recognizably different from generic genre fiction. Examine thematic depth determining whether the work explores ideas with nuance rather than simplistic moral lessons or message-driven preaching. Review genre innovation including whether the work honors conventions readers expect while subverting, combining, or freshening predictable elements. Analyze emotional authenticity determining whether character feelings, relationship dynamics, and dramatic moments ring true rather than melodramatic. Assess cultural and contextual awareness including whether the work handles setting, identity, and sensitive topics with research, nuance, and respect. Evaluate artistic risk-taking determining whether creative choices challenge the writer and audience appropriately without gimmickry that serves ego over story.

**6. Execution Planning Readiness**

Evaluate practical preparation for completing the writing project. Assess project scope clarity including whether target length, chapter structure, and timeline align with writer capability and market expectations. Examine research completeness determining whether necessary background on setting, profession, culture, or technical details has been gathered before drafting. Review outlining depth including whether plot roadmap provides sufficient structure without over-planning that kills discovery. Analyze writing process design determining whether the writer has realistic daily or weekly goals, revision plans, and feedback loops. Assess deadline feasibility including whether completion timeline accounts for drafting, cooling-off period, multiple revision passes, and beta reader incorporation. Evaluate publication strategy including whether the writer understands target markets, submission processes, or self-publishing requirements appropriate to their goals.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Creative Brief** providing project summary, target length and format, intended audience, comparable titles, and unique selling proposition.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Story Strengths** listing what's working well, including compelling elements worth protecting and enhancing during development and revision.

4. **Creative Gaps** identifying underdeveloped areas requiring attention before or during drafting, prioritized by impact on story success.

5. **Development Roadmap** providing phased actions: pre-writing preparation within two weeks, first draft milestones by chapter or word count, revision passes with specific focus areas, and feedback integration timeline.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what excellent execution looks like for this specific project, including draft completion metrics and quality benchmarks for revision readiness.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with vague premise and thin characters, 2.0-2.9 Developing with interesting concepts but structural weaknesses, 3.0-3.9 Defined with solid story elements and clear direction, 4.0-4.9 Managed with strong narrative craft and distinctive voice, 5.0 Optimized with exceptional execution and market-ready quality.

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Contemporary Short Story Collection**

Conduct a comprehensive creative writing readiness assessment for an MFA student with three years of workshop experience and prior literary magazine publications, developing a linked short story collection of twelve stories totaling 45,000 words in contemporary literary fiction exploring immigrant identity and cultural displacement targeting adult literary fiction readers, to achieve creating thematically unified collection with distinctive narrative voice that explores assimilation tensions through multiple character perspectives across three generations. The assessment should address premise originality determining if each story offers fresh angle on immigration themes avoiding stereotypical narratives, character authenticity across generations including whether younger and older characters feel equally realized, thematic coherence without repetition including whether twelve stories explore the theme from different angles without redundancy, literary prose craft appropriate for workshop and publication standards, and practical completion timeline for thesis submission deadline in eight months.

**Example 2: Middle Grade Adventure Novel**

Conduct a comprehensive creative writing readiness assessment for a debut children's author with teaching background but no prior publication credits working with developmental editor consultation, developing a middle grade adventure novel of 50,000 words featuring neurodiverse protagonist and found-family themes in contemporary realistic setting targeting readers eight to twelve years old, to achieve creating engaging page-turner that represents ADHD authentically while avoiding issue-book heaviness and centering character agency and friendship. The assessment should address protagonist likability and relatability for target age group, plot pacing ensuring chapter hooks and scene progression match middle grade attention patterns, authentic representation of neurodiversity through character actions rather than clinical explanation, dialogue voice capturing contemporary kid speech without dated slang or adult vocabulary, and market positioning determining comparable titles and unique selling proposition for agent queries.

**Example 3: Historical Fiction Screenplay**

Conduct a comprehensive creative writing readiness assessment for a screenwriter with two produced short films and television writing fellowship experience now developing first feature-length script, developing a historical drama screenplay of 110 pages set during civil rights movement exploring lesser-known activist stories in ensemble cast format targeting independent film festivals and streaming platform acquisition, to achieve creating character-driven period piece that feels relevant to contemporary audiences while honoring historical authenticity and avoiding white savior narratives. The assessment should address historical research depth including primary source consultation and cultural sensitivity review, ensemble balance ensuring multiple storylines receive adequate development within feature length, visual storytelling strength determining whether scenes show action and emotion rather than dialogue-heavy exposition, screenplay format and structure adhering to industry standards for page count and act breaks, and practical production considerations including period setting feasibility for independent film budgets.
