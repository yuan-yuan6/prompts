## Best Practices

1. **Test early and often** - Continuous testing throughout design and development
2. **Test with real users** - Recruit participants that match your target audience
3. **Focus on tasks** - Test realistic scenarios, not features in isolation
4. **Observe without interfering** - Let users struggle to identify pain points
5. **Record sessions** - Capture video for detailed analysis and stakeholder sharing
6. **Analyze systematically** - Use structured analysis methods for consistency
7. **Prioritize findings** - Focus on high-impact, high-frequency issues first
8. **Communicate clearly** - Present findings in actionable, digestible formats
9. **Close the loop** - Share results with participants when appropriate
10. **Measure impact** - Track whether changes improve key metrics

## Tips for Success

- Pilot test your testing protocol with a colleague first
- Prepare backup tasks and scenarios for quick sessions
- Create highlight reels to build stakeholder empathy
- Use a consistent analysis framework across all tests
- Build a repository of findings for pattern recognition over time
- Combine qualitative and quantitative data for fuller picture
- Test competitors' products for benchmarking and inspiration
- Schedule regular testing cadence rather than one-off studies
- Involve team members as observers to build shared understanding
- Budget for iteration - testing should inform design changes

## Customization Options

### 1. Testing Method Focus
Adapt for specific testing approaches (moderated, unmoderated, remote, in-person) with method-appropriate protocols and tools.

### 2. Product Stage
Customize for product maturity (pre-launch, newly launched, mature) with stage-appropriate testing frequency and focus.

### 3. Resource Availability
Scale testing approach based on budget, time, and team (lean testing vs. comprehensive research) while maintaining validity.

### 4. Industry Requirements
Tailor testing for industry-specific needs (healthcare, finance, education) with compliance and regulatory considerations.

### 5. User Segment
Adjust recruitment and methods for specific user groups (B2B, elderly, accessibility-focused) with appropriate accommodations.
