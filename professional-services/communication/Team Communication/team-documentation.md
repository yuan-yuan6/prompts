# Team Documentation & Knowledge Management Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for creating, organizing, and maintaining team documentation that captures knowledge, standardizes processes, and enables effective knowledge transfer.

## Quick Start

Build your team documentation system in 30 minutes:

1. **Start with the Essential 5**: Create these core documents first: (1) Team Overview & Contacts, (2) Onboarding Checklist, (3) How to Get Help, (4) Critical Processes, (5) Glossary of Terms. These cover 80% of daily needs.

2. **Use the "README First" Pattern**: Every project, repository, or system needs a README that answers: What is this? Why does it exist? How do I use it? Who do I ask for help? Keep it under one page.

3. **Apply the 3-Click Rule**: Any information should be findable within 3 clicks from your team's homepage. Create a clear navigation structure with intuitive categories before adding hundreds of pages.

4. **Document While Doing**: When someone asks "How do I...?", answer it once in documentation, then share the link. Set a team norm: if you answer the same question twice, document it.

5. **Assign Clear Ownership**: Every document needs an owner responsible for accuracy and updates. Include "Last Updated" dates and "Document Owner" at the top of each page.

**First Step**: Create a simple team wiki page with 5 sections: Who We Are, Quick Links, How to Get Started, Common Questions, and Key Contacts. Spend 15 minutes filling in the basics.
