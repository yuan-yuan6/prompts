# Compliance Program Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and operate a regulatory compliance program across six dimensions: Regulatory Scope & Prioritization, Governance & Accountability, Policies & Procedures, Training & Culture, Monitoring & Investigations, and Assurance & Remediation. Identify gaps and produce a short, evidence-driven uplift plan.

## Template

Conduct a compliance program readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating across {JURISDICTIONS} under {CORE_REGULATIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. REGULATORY SCOPE & PRIORITIZATION READINESS**
- Regulatory inventory exists and is current (laws, regs, guidance)
- Obligations are mapped to processes/products and jurisdictions
- High-risk themes are prioritized (penalties, customers, operational impact)
- Third-party obligations are included where relevant
- Regulatory change intake and triage criteria are defined

**2. GOVERNANCE & ACCOUNTABILITY READINESS**
- Three lines of defense is defined and adopted
- Decision rights exist (approvals, exceptions, risk acceptance)
- Escalation triggers and severity model are documented and used
- Ownership exists for key obligations, controls, and evidence
- Resourcing/SME coverage matches risk profile and jurisdictions

**3. POLICIES & PROCEDURES READINESS**
- Policy hierarchy exists (policy → standard → procedure)
- Lifecycle is controlled (versioning, review cadence, approvals, attestation)
- Procedures are actionable and include evidence requirements
- Exceptions are governed (time-bound, approved, tracked)
- Document repository is searchable and access-controlled

**4. TRAINING & CULTURE READINESS**
- Training is role-based and mapped to obligations/processes
- Completion is tracked and exceptions are governed
- Competency is measured (testing, observation, scenario drills) where relevant
- Leadership expectations are explicit (tone, incentives, consequences)
- Speak-up and incident reporting channels exist and are trusted

**5. MONITORING & INVESTIGATIONS READINESS**
- Monitoring coverage map exists (manual + automated)
- Alerts/cases have owners, SLAs, and audit trail
- Investigation playbooks exist for common issues
- KRIs/thresholds are defined, tuned, and tied to actions
- Third parties are monitored where risk justifies it

**6. ASSURANCE & REMEDIATION (CAPA) READINESS**
- Audit/testing approach is repeatable with evidence standards
- Findings/issues are logged and classified consistently
- Root cause analysis is consistent
- CAPA has owners, milestones, validation, and escalation
- Recurrence is measured and triggers systemic fixes

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **TOP GAPS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency
4. **90-DAY PLAN** - Sequenced uplift actions with owners and success metrics
5. **EVIDENCE INVENTORY** - Minimum evidence set for audit/exam readiness
6. **METRICS** - KPIs/KRIs definitions and reporting cadence

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, unclear ownership, weak evidence)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic components exist, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable processes and evidence standards)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured effectiveness, disciplined issue handling)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive prevention, continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "Regional Manufacturer" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "Manufacturing" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US + EU" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "Anti-corruption, privacy, safety" |

## Example

**Manufacturing - Program Readiness**

> Assess compliance program readiness for **Regional Manufacturer** in **manufacturing** across **US + EU** under **anti-corruption, privacy, and safety** obligations. Regulatory inventory exists but is not mapped to processes; decision rights for exceptions are unclear; policies exist but lack controlled attestation and evidence standards; training is annual-only with limited role specificity; monitoring is fragmented and investigations lack audit trail; CAPA closure lacks validation and recurrence tracking. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day plan focused on control mapping, evidence standards, tuned KRIs/playbooks, and CAPA validation.
