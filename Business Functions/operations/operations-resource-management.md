# Resource Management Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive resource management frameworks covering resource allocation, scheduling optimization, and capacity planning to maximize operational efficiency and resource utilization.

## Quick Resource Management Prompt
Optimize resource allocation for [ORGANIZATION_TYPE] with [RESOURCE_COUNT] [RESOURCE_TYPE] (people/equipment/facilities). Current utilization is [CURRENT_UTILIZATION]% with [BOTTLENECK_AREAS] constraints. Implement capacity planning for [DEMAND_PATTERN] (seasonal/steady/growth) demand. Balance workloads across [TEAM_COUNT] teams, reduce idle time to [IDLE_TARGET]%, and achieve [UTILIZATION_TARGET]% utilization while maintaining [SERVICE_LEVEL]% service level.

## Quick Start

To optimize resource management immediately:

1. **Calculate Current Utilization**: Measure how much of your key resources (people, equipment, facilities) are actively productive vs. idle or waiting

2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find the resources that are consistently overloaded or causing delays - these constraint resources limit your entire operation

3. **Map Demand Patterns**: Chart when demand peaks and valleys occur (daily, weekly, seasonally) to identify mismatches with resource availability

4. **Prioritize Resource Allocation**: Align your best resources to your highest-value work - use simple criteria like revenue impact, strategic importance, or deadline urgency

5. **Create Basic Schedule**: Build a weekly resource allocation plan showing who/what is assigned to which work, highlighting conflicts and gaps

**Pro Tip**: Start by optimizing your constraint resource - the one limiting your overall capacity. Even small improvements here multiply across your entire operation.
