# Partner Collaboration & Alliances Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for developing, managing, and optimizing strategic partnerships and alliances to drive mutual value creation, innovation, and market expansion.

## Quick Start

**Need to establish a strategic partnership quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Partner type: Technology integration partner
Partnership model: Deep API integration with revenue share
Target market: Enterprise customers in financial services
Revenue goal: Generate $2M in joint sales within 12 months
Integration level: Tight technical and go-to-market alignment
```

### When to Use This
- Launching new technology or channel partnerships
- Developing joint go-to-market strategies with partners
- Managing partner enablement and performance programs
- Expanding market reach through strategic alliances

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Plan Partnership** - Define mutual value proposition, select partner tier, establish success metrics and governance
2. **Enable and Launch** - Onboard partner with training, create joint marketing materials, and establish communication cadence
3. **Measure and Optimize** - Track performance metrics, conduct business reviews, and identify expansion opportunities

**Time to complete**: 1-2 days for partnership planning, 4-6 weeks for full partner onboarding and launch
