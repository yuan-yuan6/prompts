## Quick Start

**Animate Your First Scene in 45 Minutes**

1. **Choose Your Format** (5 min): Logo animation, explainer video, social media clip, or title sequence?
2. **Storyboard 3 Shots** (15 min): Sketch beginning, middle, end - stick figures are fine!
3. **Set Your Timing** (5 min): How long? (Logo: 3-5 sec, Explainer: 60-90 sec, Social: 15-30 sec)
4. **Animate One Element** (20 min): Make ONE thing move well - text, shape, or icon

**Quick-Start Recipes**:
- **Logo Reveal**: Simple in → hold → out (5 seconds total)
- **Kinetic Type**: Text enters → emphasizes key words → exits
- **Explainer**: Show problem (15s) → show solution (30s) → call to action (15s)

**Animation Rule**: Slow in, fast middle, slow out = natural movement

**Pro Tip**: Music first, then animate to the beat - instant professional feel!
