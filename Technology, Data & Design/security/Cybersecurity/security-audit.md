# Comprehensive Security Audit Framework

## Purpose
Conduct enterprise security audits covering infrastructure, applications, identity/access management, data protection, governance, incident response, third-party risk, and security operations achieving compliance validation and risk-based remediation planning.

## Template

Conduct comprehensive security audit for {ORGANIZATION} in {INDUSTRY} covering {AUDIT_SCOPE} achieving {COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS} compliance with {AUDIT_TIMELINE} engagement.

**AUDIT PLANNING AND SCOPING**

Define audit boundaries and methodology. Audit scope: infrastructure assessment (network, servers, endpoints, cloud), application security (web, mobile, APIs, databases), identity and access management (authentication, authorization, privileged access), data protection (classification, encryption, privacy), governance and risk (policies, risk management, compliance), security operations (monitoring, incident response, business continuity), third-party risk (vendors, supply chain, cloud providers). Compliance frameworks: ISO 27001 (information security management system), SOC 2 (trust services criteria), NIST Cybersecurity Framework (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover), HIPAA Security Rule (administrative, physical, technical safeguards), PCI-DSS (cardholder data environment protection), GDPR (data protection and privacy).

Audit methodology: risk assessment approach (qualitative High/Medium/Low, quantitative FAIR, or hybrid CVSS + business impact), testing methodology (black-box no prior knowledge, gray-box limited access, white-box full documentation), evidence collection (automated via GRC tool, manual screenshots and logs, centralized repository), sampling strategy (risk-based sampling of high-value systems, random sampling for controls testing, 100% coverage for critical systems). Audit standards: ISACA COBIT (IT governance framework), IIA Standards (internal audit best practices), NIST SP 800-53 (security controls catalog), OWASP Testing Guide (application security methodology).

Audit team structure: lead auditor (CISA/CISSP certified, 10+ years experience, responsible for methodology and reporting), technical specialists (OSCP for penetration testing, cloud certifications for AWS/Azure/GCP, GWAPT for application security), compliance experts (regulatory framework knowledge, control mapping expertise), external consultants (Big 4 firms for independent validation, specialized vendors for niche testing), stakeholder involvement (CISO for strategic alignment, IT management for system access, compliance team for regulatory requirements, legal for breach notification procedures).

**INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY ASSESSMENT**

Evaluate network, system, and cloud security controls. Network security: topology review (network diagrams, segmentation architecture, DMZ design), firewall configuration (rule base analysis, change management review, logging verification, deny-by-default validation), network segmentation (VLAN isolation, micro-segmentation effectiveness, PCI CDE separation, zero trust network implementation), VPN security (authentication mechanisms, encryption strength, access logging), wireless security (WPA3 implementation, guest network isolation, rogue AP detection), intrusion detection (IDS/IPS placement, signature effectiveness, tuning procedures, alert response).

Server and endpoint security: operating system hardening (CIS benchmark compliance, unnecessary service removal, security baseline adherence), patch management (patch deployment timelines, compliance rates—target 95%+, WSUS/SCCM effectiveness, emergency patching procedures), antivirus and EDR (coverage percentage, detection rates, response capabilities—CrowdStrike/Defender/SentinelOne), system logging (logging enabled on all systems, centralized aggregation, retention compliance—7 years for SOX, 6 years for HIPAA), file integrity monitoring (FIM on critical systems, baseline validation, change alerting), backup security (backup encryption, offsite storage, restoration testing quarterly, immutable backups for ransomware protection).
