# Risk Management Readiness Assessment — Market & Operational Risk

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to measure and control market and operational risk with consistent limits, validated metrics, resilient operations, and repeatable governance.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess market and operational risk readiness for [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME]. Evaluate market risk measurement and limits (VaR/sensitivities), ALM and interest rate risk governance, liquidity risk monitoring, operational risk taxonomy and controls, technology/cyber resilience, and incident response and reporting cadence. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Market Risk Measurement & Limits
- 1: Exposures are unclear; limits are informal.
- 3: Core metrics exist (sensitivities/VaR); monitoring is periodic.
- 5: Validated metrics, limit monitoring, and escalation are standard.

2) ALM, Interest Rate Risk & Balance Sheet Governance
- 1: IRR is assessed sporadically; assumptions are undocumented.
- 3: Periodic IRR and EVE/NII analysis with partial governance.
- 5: Model assumptions, scenarios, and ALCO governance are consistent.

3) Liquidity Risk Monitoring & Contingency Planning
- 1: Buffer targets are unclear; liquidity is managed reactively.
- 3: Core ratios tracked; contingency plan exists but is lightly tested.
- 5: Liquidity playbook, stress tests, and triggers are operationalized.

4) Operational Risk Controls & Loss/Issue Management
- 1: Controls are inconsistent; issues are handled case-by-case.
- 3: RCSA/controls exist for key processes; tracking is uneven.
- 5: Standard control testing, issue remediation, and near-miss capture.

5) Technology & Cyber Resilience
- 1: Critical dependencies are unclear; resilience is untested.
- 3: Baseline controls exist; periodic testing.
- 5: Defined RTO/RPO, tested DR, vulnerability management, and access governance.

6) Governance, Reporting & Incident Response
- 1: Escalation is ad hoc; reporting varies by team.
- 3: Committees exist; incident playbooks exist for major events.
- 5: Clear escalation paths, reporting cadence, and post-incident learning.

## Deliverables
- Market risk limits and escalation policy (metrics, thresholds, approvals)
- ALM pack (key assumptions, scenarios, NII/EVE impacts, actions)
- Liquidity playbook (buffers, triggers, funding sources, test cadence)
- Operational risk register (process risks, controls, issues, remediation)
- Cyber resilience summary (RTO/RPO, DR tests, critical vendors, access controls)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent monitoring and controls.
- Level 2: Documented — policies exist; enforcement varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — limits and reporting are standard for most cycles.
- Level 4: Managed — validated metrics, triggers, and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from incidents and outcomes.

## Variables
- [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME]
- [BALANCE_SHEET_PROFILE]
- [TRADING_BOOK_EXPOSURES]
- [LIMITS_FRAMEWORK]
- [IRR_SCENARIOS]
- [LIQUIDITY_BUFFERS]
- [CRITICAL_PROCESSES]
- [RTO_RPO_TARGETS]

## Example (Condensed)
Regional bank with rate sensitivity and growing digital channels.
- Market/ALM: ALCO-approved scenarios and limit triggers.
- Liquidity: contingency plan tied to stress metrics and funding actions.
- Ops/cyber: control testing, issue tracking, and DR exercises with RTO/RPO.
