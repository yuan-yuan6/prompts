# Research Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage research work effectively: planning, collaboration, documentation, quality assurance, and delivery of credible outputs.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess research management readiness for project [PROJECT]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goals & scope, (2) Planning & resourcing, (3) Collaboration & communication, (4) Data/code management, (5) Quality & review, (6) Delivery & dissemination. Provide a scorecard and operating plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goals & Scope
- 1 — Initial: Goals unclear; scope changes unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Goals and milestones defined; scope boundaries documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Scope is stable with disciplined change management and prioritization.

### 2) Planning & Resourcing
- 1 — Initial: Timeline and resourcing unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Work plan, roles, and dependencies defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Planning is mature; risks and dependencies are actively managed.

### 3) Collaboration & Communication
- 1 — Initial: Collaboration ad-hoc; decisions not recorded.
- 3 — Defined: Cadence and communication channels defined; decision log exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Collaboration is efficient; decisions are transparent and traceable.

### 4) Data/Code Management
- 1 — Initial: Artifacts scattered; reproducibility poor.
- 3 — Defined: Version control used; data organization and access defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Data/code management is robust with automation and clear conventions.

### 5) Quality & Review
- 1 — Initial: No review process; errors slip through.
- 3 — Defined: Peer review and QA steps defined; checks performed.
- 5 — Optimized: Quality is consistently high with rigorous review and validation.

### 6) Delivery & Dissemination
- 1 — Initial: Outputs late; stakeholders surprised.
- 3 — Defined: Delivery plan and dissemination pathway defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Delivery is reliable; dissemination maximizes impact and reuse.

## Deliverables
- Management readiness scorecard and risk register
- Research project plan and milestones
- Collaboration cadence and decision log template
- Data/code management conventions
- Quality/review checklist and dissemination plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROJECT]: Project name
- [TEAM]: Team
- [MILESTONES]: Milestones
- [TOOLS]: Tools
- [ARTIFACTS]: Artifacts
- [DISSEMINATION]: Dissemination plan

## Example (Condensed)
- Project: Replication study for published results
- Scores (1–5): Goals 3; Planning 2; Collaboration 3; Data/Code 2; Quality 3; Delivery 2
- 90-day priorities: Establish artifact conventions; add review gates; create milestone plan and dissemination targets
