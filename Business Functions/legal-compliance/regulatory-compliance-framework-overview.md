# Regulatory Compliance Framework - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This comprehensive regulatory compliance framework has been split into three focused sub-prompts for easier use and better organization. Each part builds on the previous one to create a complete compliance program strategy.

## Quick Regulatory Compliance Navigation Prompt
Navigate compliance framework for [organization] in [industry]. Use Part 1 (foundation) for: governance structure, policy framework, compliance culture, risk fundamentals. Use Part 2 (risk-monitoring) for: risk assessment, regulatory change management, training programs, audit basics. Use Part 3 (implementation) for: program deployment, technology, metrics, continuous improvement. Start with Part 1 for new programs.

## Quick Start Workflow

### For New Compliance Programs:
1. **Start with Part 1** - Establish governance structure and policies
2. **Move to Part 2** - Build risk management and training systems
3. **Complete with Part 3** - Implement auditing and reporting

### For Existing Programs:
- **Governance Restructure:** Use Part 1
- **Risk Enhancement:** Use Part 2
- **Performance Improvement:** Use Part 3
- **Comprehensive Review:** Use all three parts in sequence

### For Specific Needs:
- **Board Reporting:** Parts 1 & 3
- **Training Program:** Part 2
- **Audit Preparation:** Parts 2 & 3
- **Regulatory Examination:** All parts with focus on Part 3

## How to Use These Prompts

### Individual Use
Each sub-prompt can be used independently if you have a specific area of focus. Simply provide your organizational context and requirements in the designated fields.

### Sequential Use
For comprehensive framework development:
1. Complete Part 1 first to establish foundation
2. Use Part 1 output as context for Part 2
3. Integrate Parts 1 & 2 into Part 3 for complete program

### Combined Use
You can reference multiple parts simultaneously when developing cross-cutting initiatives like:
- Regulatory change implementation (Parts 2 & 3)
- Culture transformation (Parts 1 & 2)
- Performance optimization (All parts)
