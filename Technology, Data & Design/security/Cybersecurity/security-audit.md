# Comprehensive Security Audit Framework Template

## Overview
This comprehensive template enables organizations to conduct thorough security audits across all technology domains, from infrastructure and applications to governance and compliance. It provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks while ensuring regulatory compliance and best practice adherence.

## Quick Start

**Set Your Foundation:**
1. Define audit scope: infrastructure, applications, processes, or comprehensive
2. Identify compliance requirements: ISO27001, SOC2, NIST, GDPR, HIPAA
3. Set audit timeline and budget constraints

**Configure Key Parameters:**
4. Establish audit team structure: lead auditor, technical specialists, compliance experts
5. Define risk assessment methodology: qualitative, quantitative, or hybrid approach
6. Select audit standards: ISACA, IIA, NIST frameworks

**Implement & Deploy (Ongoing):**
7. Begin with network and infrastructure assessment using automated scanners (Nessus, Qualys)
8. Conduct application security testing with OWASP Top 10 focus
9. Review IAM policies, privileged access, and access control implementations
10. Document findings with severity classification and create remediation roadmap

**Pro Tips:** Use NIST Cybersecurity Framework for structure, automate vulnerability scanning, prioritize critical findings for quick wins, and maintain continuous monitoring post-audit. Plan for quarterly reviews minimum.
