# Conference Presentation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your conference talk or poster is ready by scoring six dimensions: Audience & Goal Fit, Story & Claims, Visual Design, Evidence & Figures, Delivery & Q&A, and Logistics & Assets. Use this to decide **ready / revise-first** and to produce a focused improvement plan.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **conference presentation readiness** for **{PRESENTATION_CONTEXT}** communicating **{KEY_MESSAGE}** to **{AUDIENCE}**. Score each dimension 1–5 with brief evidence: (1) audience & goal fit, (2) story & claims, (3) visual design, (4) evidence & figures, (5) delivery & Q&A, (6) logistics & assets. Provide an overall maturity level, a revise-first checklist, and a run-of-show.

**Usage:** Replace the curly-brace placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Conduct a conference presentation readiness assessment for {PRESENTATION_CONTEXT} communicating {KEY_MESSAGE} to {AUDIENCE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. AUDIENCE & GOAL FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the content matches the room: audience background, expectations, and what success looks like (inform, persuade, recruit collaborators, get feedback). Confirm the time/format constraints are respected and the talk/poster is scoped to a single primary takeaway.

**2. STORY & CLAIMS READINESS**
Evaluate whether the narrative is coherent: problem → gap → approach → key result(s) → implication. Confirm claims are specific, defensible, and proportional to evidence. Ensure you can state (a) what you did, (b) what you found, (c) why it matters, in under 30 seconds.

**3. VISUAL DESIGN READINESS**
Evaluate whether slides/poster are readable and structured: hierarchy, layout, and pacing. Confirm each slide has one job, text is minimal, and visual emphasis guides attention. For posters, ensure the scanning path is obvious and the “elevator pitch” is prominent.

**4. EVIDENCE & FIGURES READINESS**
Evaluate whether visuals carry the argument: figures are legible, annotated, and aligned to the claim they support. Confirm uncertainty/limitations are not hidden and that units, sample sizes, and key assumptions are stated where needed.

**5. DELIVERY & Q&A READINESS**
Evaluate whether you can deliver confidently: timing, transitions, and rehearsal status. Confirm you have prepped answers for methodological challenges, limitations, generalizability, and “so what?” questions. Include a plan for handling unknowns without losing credibility.

**6. LOGISTICS & ASSETS READINESS**
Evaluate whether you can actually show up and run: file formats, backups, fonts, embedded media, poster print specs, accessibility checks, and a contingency plan for tech failures. Confirm contact info and follow-up materials are ready (QR/link, preprint, repo, email).

## Required Output Format

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, ready/revise-first, top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table: dimension, score (1–5), evidence, biggest gap, highest-impact fix

3. **RUN-OF-SHOW**
- Time budget by section (intro/methods/results/implications)
- Slide/poster navigation plan
- Transition lines (2–3 sentences you’ll actually say)

4. **Q&A PREP (TOP 10)**
- Likely questions + crisp answers
- One “limitations” answer
- One “next steps” answer

5. **REVISION CHECKLIST (TOP 12)** - The exact edits to make next

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Initial:** Unclear takeaway; slides/poster cluttered; claims not tied to evidence; no rehearsal.
- **2 — Developing:** Basic structure exists; major issues in clarity, visuals, or defensibility.
- **3 — Defined:** Coherent narrative and visuals; most claims supported; needs rehearsal and tightening.
- **4 — Managed:** Polished delivery; strong figures; good timing; Q&A prepared; logistics handled.
- **5 — Optimized:** Memorable and highly effective; reusable assets; strong engagement + follow-up conversion.

## Variables (Use Max 3)

| Variable | What to include | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{PRESENTATION_CONTEXT}` | Format + venue + duration + topic | “15-min talk at NeurIPS workshop on model monitoring” |
| `{KEY_MESSAGE}` | One sentence claim/outcome | “Our method reduces false alarms by 30% without missing true drift” |
| `{AUDIENCE}` | Background + what they care about | “ML engineers; care about deployability and evaluation honesty” |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- `{PRESENTATION_CONTEXT}`: “Poster at a hospital quality-improvement symposium.”
- `{KEY_MESSAGE}`: “A simple checklist reduced medication reconciliation errors.”
- `{AUDIENCE}`: “Clinicians and administrators; want practical next steps.”

**Output (abridged)**
- Executive summary: 3.2/5 (Defined), **revise-first**
- Biggest gaps: poster scanning path unclear; outcome metric not contextualized; Q&A missing on confounders
- Next edits: add 3-step flow diagram; headline effect size with baseline; add limitations box + rollout plan QR

## Best Practices (8)

1. Design for the back row (or 30-second poster skim).
2. Lead with the takeaway, then earn it with evidence.
3. Keep claims proportional to method strength and sample size.
4. Use figures to do the heavy lifting; annotate them for your narrative.
5. Rehearse with a timer and cut until it fits cleanly.
6. Prep Q&A on limitations, generalizability, and alternative explanations.
7. Build a backup plan (PDF export, offline video, redundant adapters).
8. Make follow-up effortless (QR, link, and one clear ask).
