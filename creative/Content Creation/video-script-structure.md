## Tips for Success

- Study retention curves of successful videos in your niche
- Script hooks that work for cold audiences (no prior context)

- Plan B-roll and visual variety during scripting stage
- Write transitions that maintain momentum
- Include periodic benefit reminders for long-form content
- Structure around natural attention span limits (7-10 minutes)
