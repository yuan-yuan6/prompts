# Research Design Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design a research study with clear questions, appropriate methods, ethical safeguards, and a credible analysis plan.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess readiness to design study [STUDY] addressing question [QUESTION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Question & hypotheses, (2) Methodology & feasibility, (3) Sampling & measurement, (4) Ethics & approvals, (5) Analysis plan & rigor, (6) Execution & documentation. Provide a scorecard and a study design checklist.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Question & Hypotheses
- 1 — Initial: Question unclear; hypotheses not specified.
- 3 — Defined: Research question and hypotheses specified with outcomes.
- 5 — Optimized: Question is precise; hypotheses map to decisions and theory clearly.

### 2) Methodology & Feasibility
- 1 — Initial: Method choice unclear; feasibility uncertain.
- 3 — Defined: Method selected; feasibility constraints documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Method is well-justified; feasibility risks are managed proactively.

### 3) Sampling & Measurement
- 1 — Initial: Sampling plan missing; measures unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Sampling strategy and measures defined; instruments selected.
- 5 — Optimized: Sampling and measures are robust; validity and reliability are demonstrated.

### 4) Ethics & Approvals
- 1 — Initial: Ethics considerations incomplete; approvals unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Ethics plan and approval pathway defined (IRB/etc.).
- 5 — Optimized: Ethics is mature; consent, privacy, and risk mitigation are well managed.

### 5) Analysis Plan & Rigor
- 1 — Initial: No analysis plan; p-hacking risk high.
- 3 — Defined: Analysis plan defined; assumptions and robustness checks.
- 5 — Optimized: Rigor is high with preregistration/peer review and reproducible workflows.

### 6) Execution & Documentation
- 1 — Initial: Timeline and roles unclear; documentation weak.
- 3 — Defined: Timeline, roles, and documentation plan exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is disciplined; documentation supports replication and auditability.

## Deliverables
- Design readiness scorecard and risk register
- Study protocol outline
- Sampling and measurement plan
- Ethics/approval checklist
- Analysis plan and reproducibility plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [STUDY]: Study name
- [QUESTION]: Research question
- [POPULATION]: Target population
- [METHOD]: Methodology
- [MEASURES]: Measures/instruments
- [APPROVALS]: Approval requirements

## Example (Condensed)
- Study: Survey + interviews on remote work productivity
- Scores (1–5): Question 3; Method 3; Sampling 2; Ethics 3; Analysis 2; Execution 2
- 90-day priorities: Tighten sampling; draft analysis plan; set reproducible workflow; finalize protocol and timeline
