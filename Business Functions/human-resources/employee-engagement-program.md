# Employee Engagement Program Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and run employee engagement programs that improve retention, performance, and culture through measurable interventions.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess employee engagement readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with baseline engagement [ENGAGEMENT_SCORE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Engagement strategy & drivers, (2) Listening & feedback system, (3) Program design & interventions, (4) Manager enablement, (5) Operating model & governance, (6) Measurement & iteration. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Engagement Strategy & Drivers
- 1 — Initial: Engagement efforts are ad-hoc; drivers unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Key drivers identified; strategy and objectives documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is tuned by evidence; interventions are targeted and effective.

### 2) Listening & Feedback System
- 1 — Initial: Feedback is sporadic; results aren’t acted on.
- 3 — Defined: Survey and feedback cadence; action planning process.
- 5 — Optimized: Listening is continuous; feedback leads to visible change.

### 3) Program Design & Interventions
- 1 — Initial: Programs are generic; participation low.
- 3 — Defined: Interventions mapped to drivers (recognition, growth, wellbeing).
- 5 — Optimized: Programs are segmented and optimized; participation and impact increase.

### 4) Manager Enablement
- 1 — Initial: Managers lack tools to improve engagement.
- 3 — Defined: Manager training, resources, and expectations for engagement actions.
- 5 — Optimized: Manager capability is high; engagement improvements scale through managers.

### 5) Operating Model & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; initiatives compete with urgent work.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence; owners and decision rights; communications plan.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales; initiatives are prioritized and executed reliably.

### 6) Measurement & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: No measurement of intervention impact; issues recur.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined; action tracking; review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves retention and engagement outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Engagement readiness scorecard and gap list
- Engagement strategy and driver analysis
- Listening cadence and action planning workflow
- Program/intervention portfolio and rollout plan
- Measurement framework and governance cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [ENGAGEMENT_SCORE]: Engagement baseline
- [DRIVERS]: Engagement drivers
- [RETENTION_RATE]: Retention baseline
- [MANAGER_COUNT]: Manager count
- [PROGRAMS]: Program list

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Engagement survey scores declining and higher attrition
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 2; Listening 3; Programs 2; Managers 2; Governance 2; Iteration 2
- 90-day priorities: Identify drivers; launch targeted interventions; enable managers; implement action tracking and KPI cadence
