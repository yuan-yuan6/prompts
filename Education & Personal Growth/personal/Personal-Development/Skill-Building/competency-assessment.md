# Competency Assessment Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether you’re ready to design and operate a competency assessment that supports consistent decisions (hiring, development, promotion, certification) and produces actionable guidance—without over-claiming predictiveness.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess readiness to implement a competency assessment for **{ASSESSMENT_CONTEXT}** evaluating **{TARGET_ROLE}** to support **{DECISION_USE}**.
>
> Score readiness 1–5 across six dimensions. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, risk controls (fairness/privacy), and a lightweight operating model with a 30/60/90-day implementation plan.

---

## Readiness Dimensions (Score 1–5)

### 1) Decision Clarity & Stakeholder Alignment
- What decisions the assessment enables (and what it must not be used for)
- Who uses results and decision rights (HR, manager, panel, participant)
- Constraints defined (time, budget, accessibility, tools, legal)

### 2) Competency Model Quality
- Competencies are job-relevant and evidence-based (observable behaviors)
- Competencies are distinct (minimal overlap) and prioritized
- Proficiency levels are clear and consistently interpretable

### 3) Methods Coverage & Practicality
- Method mix fits the context (interview, work sample, portfolio, test, references)
- Coverage map from methods → competencies (no blind spots)
- Feasible at the intended scale (time per candidate / participant)

### 4) Rubrics, Scoring & Calibration
- Rubrics define anchors (what earns 1/3/5) with examples
- Aggregation rules are explicit (weighting, pass thresholds)
- Calibration plan exists (assessor training, double-scoring, drift checks)

### 5) Fairness, Bias, Privacy & Compliance
- Likely bias sources identified (language, culture, access, assessor effects)
- Accommodations and auditability designed in
- Data handling policy defined (collection, retention, access, deletion)

### 6) Operating Model & Continuous Improvement
- Tooling and workflow defined (intake → assess → report → action)
- Metrics tracked (consistency, completion, perceived fairness, outcomes)
- Iteration cadence and governance established

## Required Output Format

1) **Executive Summary**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Current maturity level (1–5)
- Top 3 risks + top 3 immediate actions

2) **Dimension Scorecard**
- Table with: Dimension | Score (1–5) | Evidence | Key gap | Quick fix

3) **Assessment Blueprint**
- Competencies (6–10) + brief behavior anchors
- Method mix + mapping to competencies
- Time per participant + operational assumptions

4) **Scoring & Calibration**
- Proficiency scale (1–5) definitions
- Rubric example for 1–2 competencies
- Calibration steps and disagreement resolution

5) **Risk Controls**
- Fairness/bias mitigations
- Privacy/data handling expectations
- What the assessment does NOT claim to predict

6) **30/60/90-Day Implementation Plan**
- Build → pilot → calibrate → rollout
- Owners, deliverables, and success metrics

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Ad hoc:** Unstructured judgments; inconsistent criteria.
- **2 — Emerging:** Some structure; limited coverage; weak calibration.
- **3 — Defined:** Clear model + methods + rubrics; repeatable process.
- **4 — Managed:** Strong calibration; fairness controls; metrics-driven.
- **5 — Optimized:** Continuously improved; validated; scalable and trusted.

## Variables

| Variable | What to provide | Example |
|---|---|---|
| {ASSESSMENT_CONTEXT} | Org/team + constraints + scale | "100-person startup, 20 hires/quarter, 60 min/candidate" |
| {TARGET_ROLE} | Role/level being assessed | "Senior Data Analyst" |
| {DECISION_USE} | Primary decision the results support | "Hiring" |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {ASSESSMENT_CONTEXT}: "Mid-size retail company; hiring 10 store managers/quarter; must run in 75 minutes total; must support accommodations; results shared with hiring panel"
- {TARGET_ROLE}: "Store Manager"
- {DECISION_USE}: "Hiring"

**Output (abridged)**
1) Executive Summary
- Overall readiness: 3.2/5 (Defined)
- Top risks: inconsistent assessor scoring, cultural bias in interviews, unclear data retention
- Immediate actions: add anchored rubrics, introduce calibration, define retention/access policy

2) Dimension Scorecard
- Decision Clarity & Alignment: 4 — Clear decision; panel roles defined
- Competency Model Quality: 3 — Competencies OK; a few overlap ("leadership" vs "coaching")
- Methods Coverage & Practicality: 3 — Interview + work sample; references missing
- Rubrics, Scoring & Calibration: 2 — Rubrics thin; no calibration plan
- Fairness, Bias, Privacy & Compliance: 3 — Accommodations planned; retention unclear
- Operating Model & Continuous Improvement: 4 — Workflow defined; metrics partially defined

3) Blueprint (summary)
- Competencies: operational execution, people leadership, customer experience, integrity, problem-solving, communication
- Methods: structured interview (30m), work sample simulation (30m), structured reference check (15m)

4) 30/60/90
- 30: finalize rubrics + assessor training
- 60: pilot with 8 candidates; analyze scoring variance
- 90: rollout; quarterly calibration + fairness audit

## Best Practices (8)
1. Start from the decision: define what the assessment is for (and not for).
2. Use observable behaviors and artifacts; avoid vague traits.
3. Keep method count small but complementary; map methods to competencies.
4. Anchor rubrics with examples for levels 1/3/5.
5. Calibrate assessors regularly to prevent scoring drift.
6. Design accommodations and auditability up front.
7. Define data handling clearly (retention, access, deletion, sharing).
8. Pilot, measure, and iterate before scaling.
