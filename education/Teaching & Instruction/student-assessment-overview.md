- Performance-based assessment
- Project and portfolio evaluation
- Multi-modal evaluation
- Grade composition strategies
- Final assessment design

**Use this when**: Measuring final achievement and assigning grades

### 4. Assessment Rubrics
**File**: `assessment-rubrics.md`

**Focus**: Scoring criteria and standards
- Performance standard definition
- Holistic and analytic rubrics
- Quality assurance and validation
- Scoring methodology
- Feedback integration
- Rubric refinement

**Use this when**: Creating scoring criteria for any assessment

### 5. Grading and Feedback Systems
**File**: `grading-feedback-systems.md`

**Focus**: Communication and reporting
- Feedback quality and delivery

- Grading philosophies and systems
- Progress reporting
- Data-driven decision making
- Grade analysis and improvement

**Use this when**: Establishing grading systems and feedback processes

## Complete Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning and Design (Weeks 1-2)
1. Identify learning outcomes
2. Select assessment methods
3. Create assessment blueprint
4. Design validity and reliability measures
5. Plan accessibility accommodations

**Primary Template**: assessment-design-principles.md

### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 2-4)
1. Develop assessment items/tasks
2. Create scoring rubrics
3. Pilot test with sample work
4. Refine based on feedback
5. Prepare administration materials

**Primary Templates**: assessment-rubrics.md, assessment-design-principles.md

### Phase 3: Implementation (Ongoing)
1. Administer formative assessments
2. Provide immediate feedback
3. Adjust instruction based on results
4. Monitor student progress
5. Identify students needing support

**Primary Template**: formative-assessment.md

### Phase 4: Final Evaluation (End of Unit/Course)
1. Administer summative assessments
2. Score using established rubrics
3. Calculate final grades
4. Provide comprehensive feedback
5. Report results to stakeholders

**Primary Templates**: summative-evaluation.md, grading-feedback-systems.md

### Phase 5: Review and Improvement (Post-Assessment)
1. Analyze assessment results
2. Evaluate assessment quality
3. Gather stakeholder feedback
4. Identify improvements needed
5. Revise for next implementation

**Primary Templates**: grading-feedback-systems.md, assessment-design-principles.md

## Quick Reference Guide

### By Assessment Purpose

**Diagnostic (Pre-Instruction)**

- Templates: formative-assessment.md
- Methods: Quick checks, exit tickets, practice problems

**Summative (End of Instruction)**
- Purpose: Evaluate achievement and assign grades
- Templates: summative-evaluation.md
- Methods: Final exams, major projects, portfolios

### By Assessment Type

**Traditional Tests**
- Design: assessment-design-principles.md
- Scoring: assessment-rubrics.md
- Grading: grading-feedback-systems.md

**Performance Assessments**
- Design: summative-evaluation.md (Performance-Based)
- Rubrics: assessment-rubrics.md (Performance Standards)
- Feedback: grading-feedback-systems.md

**Projects and Portfolios**
- Design: summative-evaluation.md (Project/Portfolio)

## Common Assessment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Designing a New Course Assessment System
1. Start with assessment-design-principles.md
2. Create assessment blueprint
3. Develop formative-assessment.md strategies
4. Design summative-evaluation.md methods
5. Create assessment-rubrics.md for scoring
6. Establish grading-feedback-systems.md

### Scenario 2: Improving Existing Assessments
1. Review with assessment-design-principles.md (Validity/Reliability)
2. Analyze data using grading-feedback-systems.md
3. Refine rubrics using assessment-rubrics.md
4. Pilot test improvements
5. Gather feedback and iterate

### Scenario 3: Addressing Low Achievement
1. Use formative-assessment.md (Diagnostic Tools)
2. Identify gaps and misconceptions
3. Implement interventions
4. Monitor progress
5. Adjust instruction

## Integration Points

### With Curriculum Development
- Align assessments with learning outcomes
- Use backward design principles
- Ensure content coverage
- Balance assessment methods

### With Instruction
- Integrate formative assessment
- Use data to adjust teaching
- Provide timely feedback
- Create assessment-instruction loops
