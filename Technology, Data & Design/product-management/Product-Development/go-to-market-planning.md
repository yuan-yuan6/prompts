## Best Practices

### GTM Strategy
1. **Segment and prioritize** - Don't try to serve everyone at launch
2. **Align motion with economics** - Sales-led for high ACV, PLG for low
3. **Focus on early adopters** - Find customers with urgent pain who will champion you
4. **Build evidence early** - Beta customers, case studies, proof points
5. **Plan for iteration** - GTM evolves as you learn

### Positioning & Messaging
1. **Own a category** - Be #1 in something specific
2. **Lead with value, not features** - Outcomes matter more than capabilities
3. **Know your differentiator** - What you do differently that matters
4. **Test messaging** - Validate with customers before launch
5. **Consistency across channels** - Same story everywhere

### Channel Strategy
1. **Start focused** - Master 1-2 channels before expanding
2. **Match channel to customer** - Where your ICP actually spends time
3. **Test and measure** - Track CAC and payback by channel
4. **Build owned channels** - Email list, community, content
5. **Balance short and long-term** - Paid for speed, organic for sustainability

### Launch Execution
1. **Build momentum pre-launch** - Beta, waitlist, press embargoes
2. **Coordinate cross-functionally** - Product, marketing, sales, CS aligned
3. **Have a war room** - Real-time monitoring and response
4. **Capture feedback immediately** - First customers are most valuable
5. **Iterate fast** - Don't wait to fix obvious problems

### Metrics & Optimization
1. **Define success upfront** - Know what good looks like
2. **Instrument everything** - Can't optimize what you don't measure
3. **Review frequently** - Weekly reviews in first 90 days
4. **Focus on leading indicators** - Metrics you can influence
5. **Be willing to pivot** - If it's not working, change course

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Build it and they will come** - Launching without clear GTM plan
✅ Instead: Invest in GTM planning as much as product development

❌ **Broad targeting** - Trying to appeal to everyone at launch
✅ Instead: Narrow ICP, nail it, then expand

❌ **Wrong GTM motion** - Enterprise sales motion for $50/month product
✅ Instead: Align GTM motion with unit economics and customer behavior

❌ **Weak differentiation** - "We're better" without proof or specifics
✅ Instead: Clear, provable differentiation that matters to customers

❌ **Neglecting enablement** - Launching without training sales/CS teams
✅ Instead: Enablement and tools ready before launch

❌ **One-size-fits-all messaging** - Same message for all audiences
✅ Instead: Tailored messaging for each buyer persona and use case

❌ **Spray and pray channels** - Trying every channel with small budget
✅ Instead: Focus budget on 2-3 channels that match your ICP

❌ **Ignoring early feedback** - Sticking to plan despite market signals
✅ Instead: Listen to customers and iterate quickly
