## Investigation Planning Framework

**Investigation Scope & Hypothesis Development**: For local government investigations (city/county contracts, zoning, police), scope 50-150 sources over 3-6 months with $25-75K budget; state investigations (statewide agencies, legislative, regulatory) require 100-250 sources over 6-12 months with $100-200K budget; national investigations (federal agencies, multi-state corporations, systemic issues) demand 200-500 sources over 12-24 months with $300K-1M budget. Hypothesis should be specific ("City procurement director steered $50M in no-bid contracts to relatives, 2019-2024") not vague ("possible corruption in city government"). Map key questions requiring answers (who benefited, how much, what laws broken, who knew, what's the cover-up) and identify evidence types that would prove/disprove hypothesis (financial records showing payments, emails showing coordination, whistleblower testimony, expert analysis of contract terms, comparison to similar jurisdictions).

**Legal Risk Assessment & Budget Allocation**: Assess defamation risk (making false statements of fact that damage reputation—mitigate with 3-source verification, document everything, legal pre-publication review, $1-3M media liability insurance); privacy violations (publishing personal info, medical records, financial data without public interest—mitigate with redaction, legal necessity test, minimize PII); source protection liability (revealing confidential sources under subpoena—establish shield law protections, use anonymous sourcing judiciously, prepare legal defense fund); copyright infringement (publishing leaked documents—fair use analysis, transformative purpose, limited excerpts); national security concerns (classified documents, espionage act—consult First Amendment attorneys, public interest defense, expect government pressure); and injunction risk (pre-publication restraint—rare but prepare expedited appeals, multiple publication outlets as backup). Budget allocation: 40% personnel (reporters, researchers, data analysts), 25% legal (pre-publication review, ongoing counsel, litigation reserve), 15% travel (source meetings, document retrieval, location reporting), 10% data tools (analysis software, FOIA processing, secure communications), 10% security (encrypted devices, secure storage, source protection measures).

## Source Development & Protection Framework

**Whistleblower Cultivation & Verification**: Initial contact through anonymous channels (SecureDrop, ProtonMail, Signal, Tor-based tip lines) with clear protection promises ("we never reveal sources without consent, use encrypted communications, can arrange in-person meetings in secure locations"). Build trust gradually over weeks/months—start with general questions, assess motivation and reliability, request documentation gradually, never pressure for more than comfortable. Verify whistleblower claims through independent document analysis (do leaked emails authenticate via DKIM headers, metadata, writing style matching known samples), corroboration with other sources (can 2+ independent whistleblowers confirm same facts without coordination), and expert validation (do subject experts find claims technically plausible, consistent with patterns). Document protection protocols: encrypted communications only (Signal, Wire, ProtonMail with PGP), secure in-person meetings (public places with counter-surveillance, vary locations, no phones), information compartmentalization (whistleblowers don't know each other, reporters use different source networks), metadata scrubbing (remove EXIF from photos, strip Word document properties, sanitize PDFs), legal shield preparation (consult with source's independent counsel if facing legal jeopardy, prepare for potential subpoenas).

**Expert & Official Source Networks**: Subject experts provide technical validation (forensic accountants to analyze financial fraud, environmental scientists for pollution data, cybersecurity experts for breach analysis, legal scholars for regulatory interpretation). Identify experts through academic publications, conference presentations, previous media appearances, professional associations; assess independence (avoid sources with financial ties to investigation targets, disclose any conflicts, seek multiple expert opinions). Current officials rarely speak on record about ongoing misconduct but provide guidance on document interpretation, regulatory context, and investigation dead-ends to avoid; former officials (retired, resigned, fired) more willing to speak on record after leaving, especially if personally aggrieved. Industry insiders (competitors, customers, suppliers, partners) offer context on normal vs abnormal practices, market comparisons, and pattern recognition. Build adversarial source relationships with investigation targets—send detailed questions in writing, allow sufficient response time (1-2 weeks typical), include targets' responses fully in story, maintain professionalism even when sources are hostile.

**Document Authentication & Chain of Custody**: Government documents obtained via FOIA authenticate through official seals, document numbering systems, and comparison with known authentic records from same agency. Financial records (bank statements, tax returns, wire transfers) verify through financial institution confirmation, forensic accounting review, and transaction pattern analysis. Internal corporate documents (emails, memos, presentations) authenticate via metadata analysis (creation dates, author info, edit history), writing style comparison with known employee communications, and corroboration of specific details with other sources. Leaked materials require highest scrutiny—verify source reliability, analyze for signs of fabrication or manipulation, seek independent confirmation of key claims, consult forensic document experts if authenticity disputed. Maintain chain of custody: document how/when received, store securely with access logs, make certified copies for analysis, preserve originals unaltered, prepare declaration of authenticity for potential legal proceedings.

## Data Journalism & Analysis Framework

**Data Collection & Cleaning**: Obtain structured data through FOIA requests (specify databases wanted in detail: "all procurement contracts >$100K, 2019-2024, fields including vendor name, contract amount, awarding department, bid process type"), direct database access if agency provides bulk downloads, public data portals, or web scraping when public-facing. Unstructured data extracted from PDFs using Tabula/Adobe tools, OCR for scanned documents, manual transcription for handwritten records. Clean data by standardizing formats (dates to YYYY-MM-DD, currency to numeric, names to consistent capitalization), handling missing values (flag rather than delete, investigate patterns of missingness), removing duplicates (match on multiple fields to avoid false positives), and validating ranges (flag outliers like negative amounts, dates in future, impossible values). Document all cleaning decisions in code/scripts for reproducibility and transparency.

**Statistical & Pattern Analysis**: Descriptive statistics establish baselines (mean contract size $250K, median $75K suggests right-skewed distribution with large outliers to investigate). Time series analysis reveals trends (are no-bid contracts increasing from 5% in 2019 to 25% in 2024), seasonal patterns (clustering of approvals before fiscal year end), and structural breaks (policy changes, leadership transitions). Network analysis maps relationships—who awards contracts to whom, which vendors share addresses/owners, which officials have family/financial ties to recipients; use Gephi or NetworkX for visualization. Anomaly detection identifies outliers for investigation (contracts 3+ standard deviations above mean, sole-source justifications with copy-paste language, amendments that triple original contract value, vendors receiving multiple contracts in single day). Geographic analysis using QGIS/Mapbox for spatial patterns (pollution clustered near low-income neighborhoods, food deserts in underserved areas, crime patterns vs enforcement patterns).

**Data Visualization & Story Integration**: Create interactive visualizations using D3.js/Observable/Flourish for web publication—network diagrams showing contract relationship webs, timeline visualizations showing sequence of events, choropleth maps showing geographic distributions, scatter plots with drill-down to individual cases. Design for accessibility (colorblind-safe palettes, alt text descriptions, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA compliance). Integrate data with narrative by embedding visualizations inline with story text, using data points as ledes ("City paid $1.2M for $200K job"), citing analysis methodology transparently ("analysis of 5,000 contracts obtained via FOIA, cleaned and analyzed using Python/Pandas"), and providing downloadable datasets for readers to verify. Balance storytelling with rigor—lead with compelling human impact, support with rigorous data analysis, but avoid chartjunk or misleading visualizations (manipulated axes, cherry-picked scales, correlation-implies-causation).

## Fact Verification & Legal Review Framework

**Multi-Source Verification Standards**: Primary facts (amounts, dates, names, specific events) require 3-source corroboration or 1 source + documentary evidence. If whistleblower claims "Director Smith approved $500K contract to brother's company on March 15," verification requires: (1) contract documents showing approval by Smith, (2) corporate records showing brother's ownership, (3) transaction date confirmation; or documentary evidence alone (signed contract, corporate filings, transaction records) with expert review confirming interpretation. Secondary claims (motivations, broader patterns, systemic issues) require 2-source corroboration plus expert validation. Source statements quoted directly ("according to former employee Jones, 'everyone knew about the bribes'") require single source but must clearly attribute as opinion not fact. Timeline verification cross-references multiple record types (emails show discussion on date X, calendar shows meeting on date Y, contract approval dated date Z) to establish sequence. Financial data verified through original records (not summaries), cross-checked with regulatory filings, and reviewed by forensic accountants.

**Legal Pre-Publication Review Process**: Engage media law firm 4-6 weeks before publication with full draft, source documentation, verification records, and target responses. Attorney review focuses on: (1) defamation risk assessment per statement (is it provably true, based on reliable sources/documents, protected opinion, substantial truth defense available); (2) privacy invasion analysis (is publication of private facts justified by public interest, are there less invasive alternatives, have you minimized unnecessary PII); (3) source protection vulnerabilities (could sources be identified from story details, are confidential source quotes clearly attributed as such, have you prepared for potential subpoenas); (4) copyright/fair use (are document excerpts limited to necessary amounts, transformative for news purpose, properly attributed). Address attorney concerns through additional verification, language softening ("documents suggest" vs "documents prove"), removing unnecessary identifying details, or adding qualifiers and context. Obtain final sign-off before publication, but retain editorial independence (attorney advice on risk, editor decision on publication).

## Security & Operational Safety Framework

**Digital Security Protocols**: Use end-to-end encrypted communications exclusively—Signal for messaging (enable disappearing messages for sensitive discussions, verify safety numbers in person), ProtonMail or Tutanota for email (with PGP for additional encryption), Wire or Jitsi for video calls (avoid Zoom/commercial platforms for sensitive sources). Secure device management: use Tails OS on USB for maximum security investigations (leaves no trace on computer), encrypt all hard drives with FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS, use password manager (1Password, Bitwarden) with unique 20+ character passwords, enable 2FA with hardware keys (YubiKey) not SMS. Network protection through VPN (Mullvad, IVPN) for all connections, Tor Browser for anonymous research, separate browsers for research (Tor) vs authenticated accounts (Firefox with containers). Secure document storage in encrypted volumes (VeraCrypt), with offline backups stored in safety deposit boxes, and real-time sync to encrypted cloud (Tresorit, SpiderOak) as redundancy.

**Source Protection & Meeting Security**: In-person meetings in public spaces (cafes, parks, libraries) with natural foot traffic and multiple exits; avoid restaurants with reservations or surveillance cameras pointed at tables. Counter-surveillance techniques: vary meeting locations/times, arrive early to observe area, avoid bringing phones (or power off and leave in car blocks away), use public transportation to meetings, check for physical/vehicle surveillance before arriving. Communication security: establish duress code words ("let's meet at the usual place" = everything fine; "let's meet at the blue place" = compromised/being monitored), use dead drops for physical document exchanges if source paranoid, establish secondary contact methods if primary compromised. Identity protection in publication: aggregate sources ("according to three current employees" not identifying details), change identifying details while preserving truth ("mid-level manager" not "deputy director of contracts"), get explicit consent before publishing any details that could narrow identification.

**Physical & Travel Security**: Hostile investigations (organized crime, corrupt officials with enforcement power, authoritarian regimes) require elevated precautions. Travel security: share itinerary with colleagues, check in daily, use burner phones purchased locally with cash, avoid hotel rooms (use Airbnb with false names), rent cars with GPS disabled, bring minimal electronics (burner laptop with no sensitive data). Office security: store sensitive documents in office safe not desks, use privacy screens on monitors, disable voice assistants (Alexa, Siri), conduct sensitive discussions in SCIF-like spaces (interior rooms with white noise machines), implement visitor logs and badge access. Personal safety: share safety concerns with editors/security consultants, consider personal security training, vary daily routines, assess threats (harassing messages, surveillance, explicit threats) and escalate to law enforcement when appropriate, maintain emergency contacts and evacuation plans for high-risk investigations.

## Publication Strategy & Impact Tracking Framework

**Multi-Platform Publication Coordination**: Long-form print/digital article (3,000-8,000 words) serves as definitive record with full narrative, evidence presentation, and methodology transparency. Video documentary (15-30 minutes) humanizes story with interviews, B-roll of locations, visualizations of data analysis; publish day-of or day-after print for sustained attention. Podcast series (3-5 episodes) allows deep dive into investigation process, reporter narration, raw audio from sources. Social media strategy: pre-publication tease (1 week before, cryptic hints building anticipation), publication day thread (key findings as tweet storm with multimedia, link to full piece), ongoing engagement (respond to reader questions, share reader analyses, post follow-up findings). Interactive data visualization as standalone piece (database of all contracts with search/filter, network diagram with hover details, timeline with embedded documents) that drives return visits and allows public to investigate further. Partnership publication with larger outlets (ProPublica, NYT, local TV stations) for amplification, resource sharing, and cross-promotion.

**Immediate Impact Measurement & Amplification**: Track audience reach (pageviews, unique visitors, time-on-page, video plays, podcast downloads) in first 24 hours, week, month to assess penetration. Engagement metrics (social shares, comments, email forwards, inbound links from other media) indicate story resonance and viral potential. Media coverage tracking: Google News alerts, TV Eyes monitoring, social listening tools (Brandwatch, Meltwater) to catalog pickup by other outlets, official responses, public discourse. Amplification tactics: author Q&A on Reddit/Twitter, op-ed placements in major outlets framing significance, briefings with advocacy groups for grassroots mobilization, academic presentations for policy research integration, awards submissions (Pulitzer, IRE, regional press associations) for credibility and promotion.

**Policy Impact Tracking & Long-term Follow-up**: Official responses in first 48 hours (agency statements, target responses, political reactions) indicate investigation credibility and threat level. Legislative action: bill introductions, committee hearings, floor debates, law passage that references investigation findings (track via bill text searches, committee transcripts, sponsor statements). Regulatory changes: policy revisions, new enforcement actions, consent decrees, regulatory guidance that cite investigation (monitor via Federal Register, agency websites, regulatory tracking services). Legal proceedings: criminal investigations opened, indictments, plea deals, convictions, civil lawsuits, settlements, court opinions citing investigation journalism. Internal reforms: firings, resignations, policy overhauls, compliance officers hired, external audits commissioned that indicate institutional response. Long-term follow-up story series (3-month, 6-month, 1-year anniversaries) documenting implemented reforms vs promised reforms vs no action, keeping pressure for accountability.
