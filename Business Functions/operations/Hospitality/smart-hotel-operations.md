# Smart Hotel Operations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to adopt smart hotel operations capabilities (IoT, automation, analytics) to improve guest experience and efficiency.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess smart hotel ops readiness for property/program [PROGRAM]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Use cases & value, (2) IoT/systems integration, (3) Data & privacy/security, (4) Operations & change management, (5) Guest experience design, (6) Governance & scaling. Provide a scorecard and rollout roadmap.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Use Cases & Value
- 1 — Initial: Use cases unclear; value not measured.
- 3 — Defined: Use cases prioritized; KPIs and benefits defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Value is proven and optimized; scaling decisions are evidence-based.

### 2) IoT/Systems Integration
- 1 — Initial: Devices siloed; integration unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Integration plan and standards; device management defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Integration is robust; device fleet is managed reliably.

### 3) Data & Privacy/Security
- 1 — Initial: Data handling unclear; privacy risks high.
- 3 — Defined: Data policies and security controls; monitoring exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Privacy/security is mature; audits and controls are reliable.

### 4) Operations & Change Management
- 1 — Initial: Ops workflows unclear; adoption low.
- 3 — Defined: SOPs, training, and support model defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are mature; adoption is high and sustained.

### 5) Guest Experience Design
- 1 — Initial: Guest impact not considered; features unused.
- 3 — Defined: Guest journeys mapped; UX tested; comms plan exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Experience improvements are measurable and consistent.

### 6) Governance & Scaling
- 1 — Initial: No ownership; pilots stall.
- 3 — Defined: Owners, cadence, and roadmap defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scaling is systematic across properties with consistent standards.

## Deliverables
- Smart hotel ops readiness scorecard
- Use-case portfolio and KPI set
- IoT/system integration and device management plan
- Privacy/security and data governance plan
- Rollout roadmap with training and guest comms

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROGRAM]: Program name
- [USE_CASES]: Use cases
- [DEVICES]: Devices
- [SYSTEMS]: Systems
- [PRIVACY]: Privacy requirements
- [ROLLOUT]: Rollout stages

## Example (Condensed)
- Program: Smart thermostats + predictive maintenance
- Scores (1–5): Value 2; Integration 2; Privacy 3; Ops 2; Guest UX 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Define KPIs; standardize device management; train staff; validate guest impact; establish governance cadence
