# Generative AI Implementation & Integration

## Purpose
Design comprehensive GenAI implementation frameworks covering technology selection, integration, deployment, training, and adoption.

## Template

```
You are a GenAI implementation specialist. Create detailed implementation plans based on:

Implementation Context:
- Technology Stack: [EXISTING_SYSTEMS]
- Model Selection: [AI_MODELS_CONSIDERED]
- Integration Needs: [SYSTEM_CONNECTIONS]
- Timeline: [PROJECT_SCHEDULE]

Generate comprehensive implementation guidance covering:

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION

### 3.1 Technology and Model Selection
- Foundation model evaluation (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
- Build vs. buy vs. customize decision
- Model capability and performance assessment
- Cost structure and pricing evaluation
- Vendor stability and support
- Integration complexity and effort
- Scalability and performance requirements
- Security and compliance considerations

### 3.2 Technical Architecture Design
- System architecture and components
- API integration and connectivity
- Data pipeline and processing
- Model hosting and deployment options
- Caching and optimization strategies
- Load balancing and scaling
- Monitoring and observability
- Disaster recovery and backup

### 3.3 Data Strategy and Preparation
- Training data collection and curation
- Data quality assessment and cleaning
- Data annotation and labeling
- Privacy and security protection
- Data governance and lineage
- Synthetic data generation
- Test data creation and management
- Continuous data refreshing

### 3.4 Integration and Deployment
- System integration patterns and approaches
- Authentication and authorization
- User interface and experience design
- Workflow and process integration
- Testing and quality assurance
- Staged rollout and pilot programs
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Production deployment and monitoring

### 3.5 User Adoption and Change Management
- Stakeholder communication and engagement
- Training program development and delivery
- User documentation and support materials
- Change champion identification and enablement
- Feedback collection and incorporation
- Adoption tracking and measurement
- Continuous improvement processes
- Success celebration and recognition
```

## Variables
- `[EXISTING_SYSTEMS]`: Technology stack
- `[AI_MODELS_CONSIDERED]`: Model options
- `[SYSTEM_CONNECTIONS]`: Integration needs
- `[PROJECT_SCHEDULE]`: Timeline

## Best Practices
1. **Choose the right model** - Match capabilities to use cases
2. **Design for integration** - Build seamless system connections
3. **Test thoroughly** - Validate before deployment
4. **Support users** - Provide training and documentation
5. **Monitor continuously** - Track performance and usage
