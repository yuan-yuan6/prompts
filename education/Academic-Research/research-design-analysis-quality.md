## Best Practices

1. **Align analyses with research questions** - Every analysis should directly address a specific research question or hypothesis
2. **Pre-register analysis plans** - Specify primary analyses before data collection to prevent data-driven decisions
3. **Check statistical assumptions thoroughly** - Verify assumptions and use appropriate tests or transformations
4. **Report effect sizes, not just p-values** - Communicate practical significance alongside statistical significance
5. **Handle missing data appropriately** - Use principled methods like multiple imputation rather than listwise deletion
6. **Establish inter-rater reliability early** - Train coders and check agreement before full qualitative analysis
7. **Use sensitivity analyses** - Test robustness of findings to alternative analytical choices
8. **Document all decisions** - Keep detailed records of analytical decisions and rationale
9. **Plan for multiple comparisons** - Use appropriate corrections when conducting multiple statistical tests
10. **Triangulate findings** - Use multiple methods or data sources to validate key conclusions

## Tips for Success

- Create a detailed analysis plan before collecting data to ensure all necessary data are gathered
- Learn statistical software thoroughly or work with expert analysts on your team
- Use simulation studies to test analytical approaches with your expected data structure
- Keep raw data separate from cleaned/analyzed data with clear version control
- Create reproducible analysis scripts that document every step
- Build in quality checks at multiple stages rather than only at the end
- Consult with methodologists when planning complex or innovative analyses
- Consider statistical power throughout - for main effects and interactions
- Use visualization extensively to understand data patterns before formal analysis
- Plan analysis time generously - it almost always takes longer than expected

## Customization Options

1. **Discipline-Specific Standards**: Adapt analytical approaches and quality criteria to field-specific conventions in education, healthcare, psychology, sociology, or other disciplines with appropriate methods and reporting standards

2. **Design Complexity Level**: Scale from simple descriptive analyses to complex multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, or advanced qualitative methods depending on research sophistication and team expertise

3. **Data Type Emphasis**: Customize for predominantly quantitative (statistical modeling), qualitative (interpretive analysis), or truly integrated mixed-methods approaches with appropriate analysis strategies for each

4. **Technology Integration**: Range from manual coding and basic statistical packages to advanced computational methods, machine learning, AI-assisted analysis, or big data approaches based on data characteristics and resources

5. **Quality Assurance Depth**: Adjust from basic quality checks for exploratory studies to comprehensive validation protocols for high-stakes clinical trials or policy research requiring extensive documentation and oversight
