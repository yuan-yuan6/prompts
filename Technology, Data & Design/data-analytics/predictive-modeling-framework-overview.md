# Predictive Modeling Framework - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This comprehensive framework has been split into 3 focused sub-prompts for easier navigation and use.

## Quick Navigation Prompt
> I need to build a [classification/regression/forecasting] model for [use case]. Current stage: [data prep/model training/deployment]. Help me navigate: (1) Which part of the framework should I use? (2) What are the key sections for my stage? (3) What outputs should I produce before moving to the next part?

## Framework Structure

### Part 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering (Lines 1-366)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-01-data-preparation.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
- Clean and preprocess raw data for modeling
- Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues
- Engineer features from existing data columns
- Create training/validation/test splits
- Address class imbalance and sampling strategies

### Part 2: Model Development & Evaluation (Lines 367-626)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-02-model-development.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
- Select appropriate algorithms for your problem type
- Train and tune model hyperparameters
- Evaluate model performance with appropriate metrics
- Compare multiple models and select the best approach
- Interpret model results and feature importance

### Part 3: Deployment & Monitoring (Lines 627-1075)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-03-deployment.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
- Deploy models to production environments
- Set up model serving infrastructure
- Implement monitoring for model drift and performance
- Create retraining pipelines and triggers
- Establish governance and documentation

## Quick Navigation

**Complete Workflow:**
1. Start with Part 1 for data preparation & feature engineering
2. Start with Part 2 for model development & evaluation
3. Start with Part 3 for deployment & monitoring
