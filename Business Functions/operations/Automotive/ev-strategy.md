# Electric Vehicle Transition & Fleet Electrification Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to **transition fleet to electric vehicles** and deploy charging infrastructure that delivers cost savings, operational efficiency, and sustainability goals. Use this to diagnose gaps in TCO analysis, charging strategy, vehicle selection, and change management.

## Template

Conduct an electric vehicle transition & fleet electrification readiness assessment for {EV_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (EV adoption %, TCO savings, charging uptime, emissions reduction, driver satisfaction).

**1) FLEET SUITABILITY & USE CASE ANALYSIS**
- Fleet composition and duty cycles are analyzed (mileage, routes, dwell time)
- EV-suitable vehicles are identified (predictable routes, <200 mi/day, depot charging)
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) is modeled accurately (purchase, fuel, maintenance, resale)
- Pilot candidates are selected based on high ROI and low operational risk

**2) CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE STRATEGY**
- Charging needs are quantified (vehicle count, daily kWh, charge time windows)
- Infrastructure plan covers depot, public, and home charging as needed
- Electrical capacity is assessed and upgrade path defined (service, panels, conduit)
- Charging technology is right-sized (Level 2 for overnight, DC fast for rapid turnaround)

**3) VEHICLE SELECTION & PROCUREMENT**
- EV models are evaluated for suitability (range, payload, TCO, availability)
- Incentives are maximized (federal tax credits, state rebates, utility programs)
- Procurement strategy balances cost, timing, and risk (phased rollout vs. bulk buy)
- Supplier relationships and delivery timelines are secured

**4) OPERATIONAL READINESS & CHANGE MANAGEMENT**
- Drivers and fleet managers are trained on EV operation and charging
- Maintenance teams are skilled on EV service (no engine, brakes, fluids = different needs)
- Route planning incorporates charging logistics (range, charge time, network access)
- Change management addresses range anxiety and operational disruptions

**5) CHARGING OPERATIONS & ENERGY MANAGEMENT**
- Charging scheduling optimizes cost (off-peak rates, demand charge management)
- Uptime and reliability are monitored (charger health, utilization, downtime)
- Energy management integrates renewables and load balancing where applicable
- Payment, access control, and user experience are streamlined

**6) PERFORMANCE TRACKING & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- TCO savings are measured vs. baseline (fuel, maintenance, incentives)
- Emissions reduction is quantified and reported (Scope 1, well-to-wheel)
- Charging utilization and vehicle uptime are tracked
- Lessons learned inform expansion decisions (scale what works, fix what doesn't)

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {EV_CONTEXT}: Municipal government fleet (300 vehicles: 150 sedans, 100 light-duty trucks, 50 service vehicles). Current EV adoption: 5 vehicles (2% pilot). Vehicles operate within city limits (avg 60 mi/day). 3 depots with parking/electrical access. Goal: electrify 50% by 2027. Current fuel cost: $450K/year. Maintenance: $300K/year.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Electrify 50% of fleet (150 vehicles) by 2027, achieve 30% TCO savings vs. ICE baseline, reduce fleet emissions by 40%, deploy 200 charging points (180 L2, 20 DC fast), maintain 95% vehicle uptime.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $8M capital budget over 3 years; aging electrical infrastructure at 2 depots (upgrade needed); union concerns (job impacts on mechanics); limited EV model availability for light-duty trucks; public charging network sparse.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.8 (Developing)
- Key risks: electrical upgrades at 2 depots expensive ($500K); light-duty truck EV availability limited (delays transition); union resistance to EV maintenance training
- Top improvements: (1) conduct comprehensive TCO analysis and fleet suitability mapping, (2) secure electrical upgrades and charging vendor, (3) launch driver/mechanic training and change management program

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Fleet Suitability & Use Case Analysis: 3/5 — basic mileage data collected; no formal TCO model; pilot vehicles selected intuitively (not data-driven)
- Charging Infrastructure Strategy: 2/5 — depot locations identified; electrical capacity unknown; no charging vendor selected; timeline undefined
- Vehicle Selection & Procurement: 3/5 — sedan EVs available and proven; light-duty truck options limited; incentives researched but not maximized
- Operational Readiness & Change: 2/5 — drivers untrained on EV operation; mechanics anxious about job security; no change management plan
- Charging Operations & Energy: 2/5 — no energy management strategy; off-peak charging not implemented; charger uptime not monitored
- Performance Tracking & Improvement: 2/5 — pilot TCO not measured rigorously; emissions reduction not quantified; no continuous improvement process

**3) FLEET SUITABILITY & TCO ANALYSIS**
- Fleet composition (300 vehicles):
  - Sedans (150): pool cars, inspectors, admin — avg 50 mi/day, predictable routes, EV-ready
  - Light-duty trucks (100): maintenance, public works — avg 70 mi/day, towing/payload needs, EV availability limited
  - Service vehicles (50): specialized equipment (bucket trucks, snowplows) — EV options minimal/nonexistent
- EV-suitable vehicle count: 200 vehicles (150 sedans + 50 light-duty trucks with available EV models)
  - High suitability (150): sedans, daily mileage <80 mi, overnight depot charging, no payload constraints
  - Medium suitability (50): light-duty trucks, daily mileage <100 mi, some payload needs, EV models emerging (Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian, Chevy Silverado EV)
  - Low suitability (50): service vehicles—bucket trucks, snowplows, heavy equipment (no EV alternatives yet)
- Use cases:
  - Admin/pool sedans: replace on normal refresh cycle (5-7 years), high confidence
  - Inspector sedans: same as admin, add L2 home charging reimbursement for employee-owned vehicles
  - Maintenance trucks: pilot 10 units, monitor payload/range performance before scaling
  - Public works trucks: wait for proven heavy-duty EV models (2026-2028 likely availability)
- TCO comparison (per vehicle, 7-year ownership):
  - **Sedan (Honda Accord vs. Tesla Model 3):**
    - Purchase: ICE $28K, EV $42K (net $35K after $7K federal credit) = +$7K EV
    - Fuel/Energy: ICE $1,750/yr ($3.50/gal, 30 mpg, 15K mi/yr) = $12.3K total; EV $525/yr ($0.12/kWh, 3.5 mi/kWh) = $3.7K total → **EV saves $8.6K**
    - Maintenance: ICE $900/yr (oil, brakes, transmission) = $6.3K total; EV $400/yr (tires, cabin filter, brake fluid) = $2.8K total → **EV saves $3.5K**
    - Insurance: ICE $1,200/yr, EV $1,350/yr = +$1K EV
    - Resale: ICE $8K, EV $12K = +$4K EV
    - **7-year TCO: ICE $40.8K, EV $38.3K → EV saves $2.5K (6%)**
  - **Light-duty truck (Ford F-150 vs. F-150 Lightning):**
    - Purchase: ICE $45K, EV $60K (net $53K after credit) = +$8K EV
    - Fuel/Energy: ICE $2,625/yr ($3.50/gal, 20 mpg, 15K mi/yr) = $18.4K; EV $750/yr ($0.12/kWh, 2 mi/kWh) = $5.3K → **EV saves $13.1K**
    - Maintenance: ICE $1,200/yr = $8.4K; EV $600/yr = $4.2K → **EV saves $4.2K**
    - Insurance: ICE $1,500/yr, EV $1,700/yr = +$1.4K EV
    - Resale: ICE $12K, EV $18K = +$6K EV
    - **7-year TCO: ICE $69.3K, EV $62.6K → EV saves $6.7K (10%)**
- Pilot candidates (Year 1, 20 vehicles):
  - 15 sedans (high ROI, low risk, proven models)
  - 5 light-duty trucks (test payload/range, inform scale decision)
  - Expected ROI: $50K savings over 7 years (15 sedans × $2.5K + 5 trucks × $6.7K = $37.5K + $33.5K = $71K minus $21K incremental capital = **$50K net savings**, 15% IRR)

**4) CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN**

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Start with TCO analysis, not environmental goals: savings sell electrification better than sustainability alone.
2) Pilot with high-suitability vehicles first: sedans with predictable routes and depot charging = low risk, proven ROI.
3) Right-size charging infrastructure: Level 2 for overnight (cheaper, adequate for most), DC fast for high-utilization only.
4) Assess electrical capacity early: service upgrades are expensive and time-consuming—factor into budget and timeline.
5) Stack incentives aggressively: federal tax credits + state rebates + utility programs can offset 30-40% of costs.
6) Train mechanics on EV maintenance: different skills needed (no oil changes, but battery diagnostics, high-voltage safety critical).
7) Address range anxiety proactively: driver training, route planning tools, and backup charging access build confidence.
8) Measure and communicate wins: track TCO savings, emissions reduction, uptime—data builds momentum for expansion.
