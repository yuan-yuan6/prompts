# Meeting Management Framework - Part 1: Preparation & Structure

## Part Overview

**This is Part 1 of 3** in the Meeting Management Framework series.

- **Part 1 (This Part):** Meeting Preparation & Structure - Foundation, strategy, planning, and technology
- **Part 2:** Meeting Facilitation & Engagement - Facilitation techniques, engagement, and documentation
- **Part 3:** Meeting Follow-up & Improvement - Measurement, optimization, and transformation

## Quick Start

Get started with meeting management in 3 simple steps:

1. **Define Your Meeting Purpose** - Start by identifying whether your meeting is strategic (planning, vision), operational (status updates, coordination), or project-based (deliverables, milestones). Set clear objectives and success criteria before sending invitations.

2. **Select Key Participants** - Identify essential decision-makers and subject matter experts. Keep the participant list lean - only include people who need to contribute or make decisions. Share an agenda 24 hours in advance with time allocations for each topic.

3. **Implement Action Tracking** - Use the meeting minutes template to capture decisions and assign action items with clear owners and deadlines. Send a summary within 24 hours and schedule a 5-minute follow-up at the next meeting to review progress.

**Pro Tip**: Start with weekly team standups using a simple agenda: (1) Progress since last meeting, (2) Priorities for this week, (3) Blockers/help needed. Limit to 30 minutes maximum.

**What's in This Part:**
- Meeting strategy and value frameworks
- Meeting classification and design principles
- Technology stack selection and integration
- Agenda architecture and time management
- Pre-meeting preparation workflows

**Next Steps:** After completing your meeting preparation, continue to Part 2 for facilitation techniques and engagement strategies.
