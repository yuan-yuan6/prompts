# Inventory Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage inventory accurately across channels, reduce stockouts/overstock, and improve fulfillment performance with reliable data and operating cadences.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess inventory management readiness for [BUSINESS] with [SKU_COUNT] SKUs and [CHANNELS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Demand forecasting, (2) Replenishment & planning, (3) Inventory visibility, (4) Fulfillment & allocation, (5) Systems & integrations, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Demand Forecasting
- 1 — Initial: Forecasting is manual; seasonality/promotions not incorporated.
- 3 — Defined: Forecast process defined; key drivers included; review cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Forecast accuracy is measured and improves; forecasts drive decisions reliably.

### 2) Replenishment & Planning
- 1 — Initial: Reorder points are inconsistent; planning is reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Planning rules, lead times, and safety stock are defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Replenishment is optimized by service levels and constraints.

### 3) Inventory Visibility
- 1 — Initial: Counts are unreliable; channel inventory mismatches are common.
- 3 — Defined: Standardized counting and reconciliation; near-real-time visibility.
- 5 — Optimized: Visibility is trusted across systems; exceptions are detected quickly.

### 4) Fulfillment & Allocation
- 1 — Initial: Allocation is ad-hoc; stockouts impact priority channels.
- 3 — Defined: Allocation rules by channel/region; backorder handling defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Allocation optimizes margin and service level; fulfillment performance improves.

### 5) Systems & Integrations
- 1 — Initial: Tools are fragmented; integrations are brittle; manual work is high.
- 3 — Defined: Core systems integrated (ERP/WMS/OMS); workflows documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Automation reduces manual effort; data quality is monitored.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: KPIs inconsistent; root-cause analysis is rare.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs tracked (fill rate, stockouts, turns); review cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement reduces stockouts and working capital over time.

## Deliverables
- Inventory readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Forecasting and replenishment operating cadence
- Inventory visibility and reconciliation process
- Fulfillment/allocation rules by channel
- KPI dashboard and improvement backlog

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Retailer/e-commerce business
- [SKU_COUNT]: Number of SKUs
- [CHANNELS]: DTC, marketplaces, stores
- [LEAD_TIME]: Supplier lead time
- [SERVICE_LEVEL_TARGET]: Desired fill rate
- [STOCKOUT_RATE]: Current stockout rate

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Omnichannel retailer with frequent marketplace stockouts
- Scores (1–5): Forecast 2; Planning 2; Visibility 2; Allocation 3; Systems 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Fix inventory accuracy; define allocation rules; implement KPI cadence and forecasting process
