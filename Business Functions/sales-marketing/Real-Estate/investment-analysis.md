# Real Estate Investment Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to underwrite and evaluate real estate investments with consistent assumptions, risk controls, and decision-grade outputs.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess investment analysis readiness for [DEAL_NAME] in [MARKET] with target IRR [IRR_TARGET]%. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Deal thesis & assumptions, (2) Financial modeling, (3) Financing & capital structure, (4) Risk & scenario analysis, (5) Process & governance, (6) Reporting & decision support. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Deal Thesis & Assumptions
- 1 — Initial: Thesis unclear; assumptions inconsistent across deals.
- 3 — Defined: Thesis and key assumptions documented; comparable support included.
- 5 — Optimized: Assumptions are evidence-based; underwrites are consistent and comparable.

### 2) Financial Modeling
- 1 — Initial: Models vary by analyst; errors common.
- 3 — Defined: Standard model structure; QA checks; sensitivity tables.
- 5 — Optimized: Modeling is reliable and efficient; results are reproducible.

### 3) Financing & Capital Structure
- 1 — Initial: Financing terms unclear; debt assumptions unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Debt options and terms modeled; constraints documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Capital structure optimized; financing risk is actively managed.

### 4) Risk & Scenario Analysis
- 1 — Initial: Risks not quantified; downside scenarios missing.
- 3 — Defined: Key sensitivities defined; scenario set; mitigation actions.
- 5 — Optimized: Risk analysis guides decisions; scenario planning is routine.

### 5) Process & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Approvals inconsistent; documentation incomplete.
- 3 — Defined: Investment committee process; checklists; decision rights.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed and consistency; audit trail is strong.

### 6) Reporting & Decision Support
- 1 — Initial: Outputs are hard to compare; key points buried.
- 3 — Defined: Standard memo format; comparable deal metrics.
- 5 — Optimized: Reports are decision-grade; insights drive clear actions and negotiations.

## Deliverables
- Investment underwriting readiness scorecard and gap list
- Standard underwriting model and QA checklist
- Assumptions library and comps support
- Scenario/sensitivity analysis and risk register
- Investment memo template with decision summary

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [DEAL_NAME]: Deal name
- [MARKET]: Market
- [IRR_TARGET]: Target IRR
- [CAP_RATE]: Cap rate assumptions
- [RENT_GROWTH]: Rent growth assumptions
- [DEBT_TERMS]: LTV, rate, amortization

## Example (Condensed)
- Deal: Value-add multifamily acquisition
- Scores (1–5): Thesis 3; Modeling 2; Financing 2; Risk 2; Governance 3; Reporting 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize model + QA; build assumptions library; formalize scenario analysis and memo format
