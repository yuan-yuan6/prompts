# Feedback Delivery & Performance Conversations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver **timely, constructive, and growth-oriented feedback** that builds trust, improves performance, and accelerates development. Use this to diagnose gaps in feedback skills, culture, and systems.

## Template

Conduct a feedback delivery & performance conversations readiness assessment for {FEEDBACK_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (feedback frequency, manager capability, employee trust, performance improvement).

**1) FEEDBACK CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY**
- Feedback is normalized as growth-oriented (not punitive)
- Employees feel safe giving and receiving candid feedback
- Leaders model vulnerability by seeking and acting on feedback
- Mistakes are treated as learning opportunities, not career risks

**2) FEEDBACK SKILLS & FRAMEWORKS**
- Managers are trained on feedback frameworks (SBI, STAR, Radical Candor)
- Feedback is specific, timely, and behavior-focused (not personal)
- Positive feedback is given as frequently as constructive feedback
- Difficult conversations are handled with empathy and clarity

**3) TIMELINESS & FREQUENCY**
- Feedback is delivered within 24–48 hours of the event
- Regular 1-on-1s (weekly or biweekly) create feedback rhythm
- Performance issues are addressed early (not saved for annual reviews)
- Recognition happens in real-time, not just at milestones

**4) STRUCTURE & DOCUMENTATION**
- Feedback conversations follow a clear structure (context, observation, impact, action)
- Performance reviews are comprehensive, evidence-based, and developmental
- Improvement plans have clear expectations, timelines, and support
- Documentation protects both employee and organization (legal, HR compliance)

**5) TWO-WAY DIALOGUE & ACTION**
- Feedback is a dialogue (not a monologue); employee perspective is sought
- Action plans are co-created with employee input and ownership
- Follow-up happens consistently to track progress and adjust
- Feedback recipients see their input lead to changes (manager behavior, processes)

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Feedback effectiveness is measured (360 surveys, engagement, performance trends)
- Manager feedback skills are assessed and developed
- Feedback culture is tracked (frequency, quality, employee perception)
- Best practices are shared and scaled across teams

---

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, feedback culture risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **FEEDBACK SKILLS ASSESSMENT**
- Manager capability levels (by cohort or level)
- Common feedback failure modes (vague, late, personal, punitive)

4) **FEEDBACK FREQUENCY & QUALITY ANALYSIS**
- Avg 1-on-1 frequency, feedback timeliness, recognition vs. constructive ratio
- Employee perception of feedback quality (from surveys)

5) **PERFORMANCE CONVERSATION PLAYBOOK**
- Templates and frameworks (SBI, STAR, improvement plans, performance reviews)
- Guidance for difficult conversations (PIP, termination, conflict)

6) **30/60/90-DAY FEEDBACK CULTURE PLAN**
- Actions to improve skills, timeliness, and psychological safety
- Metrics (feedback frequency, manager skill scores, employee trust, performance improvement)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (infrequent, vague, fear-based, no structure)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic attempts, inconsistent quality, limited safety)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (regular feedback, solid skills, growth-oriented)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (timely, high-quality, strong trust, measured improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (continuous dialogue, exemplary skills, high psychological safety)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {FEEDBACK_CONTEXT}: Org size, manager count, current feedback frequency/quality, culture challenges
- {OBJECTIVES}: Feedback frequency, manager skill level, employee trust, and performance improvement goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Manager capacity, training budget, HR support, cultural norms

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {FEEDBACK_CONTEXT}: 500-person SaaS company. 50 managers. Current 1-on-1 frequency: 40% weekly, 60% biweekly or less. Last engagement survey: 52% "receive timely feedback" (goal 80%), 48% "feel safe giving upward feedback." Manager feedback training: 1-day workshop 2 years ago (30% of current managers attended).
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase "receive timely feedback" to 80%, improve manager feedback skill scores from 6.2/10 to 8.5/10, establish weekly 1-on-1 norm (90% compliance), reduce performance improvement plan (PIP) surprise rate from 60% to <10%.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 50 managers to train; $20K training budget; HR team of 3; cultural norm of "niceness" avoids difficult conversations; remote/hybrid complicates connection.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.6 (Developing)
- Key risks: 48% don't feel safe giving upward feedback; 60% of PIPs are surprises (issues not surfaced early); manager skills inconsistent
- Top improvements: (1) train managers on SBI framework, (2) establish weekly 1-on-1 norm, (3) build psychological safety rituals

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Feedback Culture & Safety: 2/5 — feedback seen as negative; upward feedback risky; leaders don't model vulnerability
- Feedback Skills & Frameworks: 2/5 — vague feedback common ("good job," "needs improvement"); SBI not widely used
- Timeliness & Frequency: 3/5 — 1-on-1s happen but 60% biweekly or less; issues saved for reviews
- Structure & Documentation: 3/5 — performance reviews exist; PIPs inconsistent; no improvement plan template
- Two-Way Dialogue & Action: 2/5 — feedback often monologue; employee input not sought; follow-up spotty
- Measurement & Improvement: 3/5 — engagement survey asks about feedback; no manager skill tracking

**3) FEEDBACK SKILLS ASSESSMENT**
- Manager capability (from 360 surveys + HR observation):
  - High skill (8+/10): 20% of managers (mostly senior, formal training background)
  - Medium skill (6–8/10): 50% of managers (basic competence, room for specificity and timeliness)
  - Low skill (

<6/10): 30% of managers (vague, infrequent, avoids difficult conversations)
- Common failure modes:
  - Vague feedback: "You need to be more proactive" (no examples)
  - Late feedback: issues saved for quarterly reviews (not 24–48h)
  - Personal attribution: "You're not a team player" (not behavior-focused)
  - Punitive tone: feedback delivered as criticism, not growth opportunity

**4) FEEDBACK FREQUENCY & QUALITY ANALYSIS**
- 1-on-1 frequency: 40% weekly, 45% biweekly, 15% monthly or ad hoc (goal 90% weekly)
- Feedback timeliness: avg 2 weeks between event and feedback (goal 24–48h)
- Recognition vs. constructive ratio: 1:3 (1 positive for every 3 constructive; goal 3:1)
- Employee perception (from survey):
  - "Receive timely feedback": 52% agree (goal 80%)
  - "Feel safe giving upward feedback": 48% agree (goal 75%)
  - "Feedback helps me improve": 58% agree (goal 85%)

**5) PERFORMANCE CONVERSATION PLAYBOOK**
- SBI Framework template: Situation (when/where), Behavior (specific action observed), Impact (effect on team/project/customer)
- STAR Method template: Situation (context), Task (responsibility), Action (what you did), Result (outcome achieved)
- Performance review template: accomplishments, competencies, goals, development plan, rating
- Improvement plan template: performance gap, expectations, timeline, support, consequences, check-ins
- Difficult conversation guide: prepare with facts, lead with care, state the issue directly, listen for understanding, co-create action plan, document, follow up
- Termination conversation checklist: HR/legal prep, severance/logistics, direct message, empathy, exit process, team communication

**6) 30/60/90-DAY FEEDBACK CULTURE PLAN**
- 30 days: train all 50 managers on SBI framework (2-hour workshop); establish weekly 1-on-1 standard (track compliance); launch "Feedback Friday" ritual (managers share one piece of positive feedback publicly each Friday)
- 60 days: introduce 360 feedback for managers (peer, direct report, upward); create feedback culture guide (dos/don'ts, examples); HR office hours for difficult conversation coaching
- 90 days: track manager feedback skill scores via 360; pilot "Ask Me Anything" sessions (leaders model vulnerability); analyze PIP surprise rate; refine training based on feedback
- Metrics: "receive timely feedback" (goal 65% by 90 days), 1-on-1 compliance (goal 80%), manager skill score (goal 7.5/10), PIP surprise rate (goal 30%)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Use the SBI framework: Situation, Behavior, Impact—keep feedback specific and actionable.
2) Deliver feedback within 24–48 hours while it's fresh and relevant.
3) Balance positive and constructive feedback with a 3:1 ratio to build trust.
4) Make feedback a two-way dialogue: ask "What's your perspective?" before prescribing solutions.
5) Schedule weekly 1-on-1s to create a predictable feedback rhythm, not just ad hoc.
6) Address performance issues early and directly—don't save for annual reviews or PIPs.
7) Model vulnerability as a leader: seek feedback publicly and act on it visibly.
8) Document feedback consistently for performance reviews, PIPs, and legal protection.
