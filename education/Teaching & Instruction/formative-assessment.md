## FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES

### Quick Checks for Understanding
1. **Exit Tickets** - End-of-class quick assessment
2. **Thumbs Up/Down** - Quick confidence check
3. **Think-Pair-Share** - Collaborative understanding
4. **Whiteboards** - Visual response gathering
5. **Clickers/Polls** - Digital response systems
6. **Minute Papers** - Brief written reflections
7. **3-2-1** - 3 things learned, 2 questions, 1 application
8. **Misconception Check** - Address common errors

### Ongoing Monitoring Tools
- Learning management system analytics
- Discussion board participation
- Draft submissions and revisions
- Practice problem performance
- Lab or practical work observations
- Homework completion and quality
- Self-assessment reflections
- Peer feedback exchanges

### Diagnostic Assessments
- Pre-tests and baseline assessments
- Concept inventories
- Skill demonstration tasks
- Knowledge mapping exercises
- Error analysis activities
- Think-aloud protocols
- Diagnostic interviews
- Portfolio reviews

## FEEDBACK STRATEGIES

### Effective Feedback Characteristics
**Timely**: Provided soon after performance
**Specific**: Focused on particular aspects
**Actionable**: Includes clear next steps
**Kind**: Delivered with respect and care
**Strength-Based**: Acknowledges what's working
**Goal-Oriented**: Connects to learning objectives
**Personalized**: Relevant to individual student
**Forward-Looking**: Focuses on improvement

### Feedback Delivery Methods
- Written comments on work
- Audio/video recorded feedback
- One-on-one conferences
- Small group discussions
- Peer feedback sessions
- Self-assessment rubrics
- Automated system feedback
- Real-time guidance during work

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Create Formative Assessment Culture
- Emphasize learning over grading
- Encourage risk-taking and mistakes
- Make thinking visible
- Promote self-assessment
- Value improvement and growth
- Provide multiple opportunities
- Celebrate progress
- Support peer learning

### Balance Formative and Summative
- Use formative to prepare for summative
- Low-stakes practice before high-stakes assessment
- Formative feedback informs teaching adjustments
- Track progress toward summative goals
- Build confidence through formative success
- Reduce assessment anxiety
- Promote mastery learning
- Support diverse learners

## Ensure formative assessment is
- Frequent and ongoing
- Low-stakes and supportive
- Feedback-rich
- Actionable and timely
- Integrated with instruction
- Student-centered
- Growth-oriented
- Motivating and engaging
```

## Variables
- `[COURSE_PROGRAM_NAME]`: Course name
- `[ACADEMIC_LEVEL]`: Educational level
- `[STUDENT_DEMOGRAPHICS]`: Student population
- `[ASSESSMENT_PERIOD]`: Duration
- `[LEARNING_OUTCOMES]`: Learning objectives
- `[DIGITAL_CAPABILITIES]`: Technology access

## Best Practices

1. **Make it frequent** - Regular check-ins, not one-time events
2. **Keep it low-stakes** - Focus on learning, not grades
3. **Provide immediate feedback** - Timely response is key
4. **Use varied methods** - Different techniques for different purposes
5. **Involve students** - Self and peer assessment builds ownership
6. **Act on results** - Adjust teaching based on feedback
7. **Close the loop** - Ensure students use feedback to improve
8. **Celebrate growth** - Recognize progress and effort
9. **Make it manageable** - Don't overwhelm yourself or students
10. **Integrate seamlessly** - Part of instruction, not separate

## Tips for Success

- Start small - add one new technique at a time
- Use technology to streamline feedback
- Create feedback templates for common issues
- Train students in peer and self-assessment
- Build in reflection time for students to process feedback
- Track which students need additional support
- Share successful strategies with colleagues
- Collect student feedback on assessment methods
- Focus on most important learning goals
- Remember formative assessment should inform, not just record
