# Predictive Modeling Framework - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This comprehensive framework has been split into 3 focused sub-prompts for easier navigation and use.

## Framework Structure

### Part 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering (Lines 1-366)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-01-data-preparation.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 1]

### Part 2: Model Development & Evaluation (Lines 367-626)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-02-model-development.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 2]

### Part 3: Deployment & Monitoring (Lines 627-1075)
**File:** `predictive-modeling-framework-03-deployment.md`

**Use this part when you need to:**
[Focus area for part 3]

## Quick Navigation

**Complete Workflow:**
1. Start with Part 1 for data preparation & feature engineering
2. Start with Part 2 for model development & evaluation
3. Start with Part 3 for deployment & monitoring
