# Game Design and Development Strategy

## Purpose
Design complete video games from concept through post-launch support including core gameplay loop, progression systems, narrative design, level creation, economy balancing, monetization strategy, and live operations achieving target retention (D1 40%+, D7 20%+, D30 10%+) and revenue goals.

## Template

Design {GAME_TITLE} in {GENRE} for {PLATFORM} targeting {AUDIENCE} with {TEAM_SIZE} developers, {BUDGET} budget, {TIMELINE} development, achieving {RETENTION}% D7 retention and {REVENUE_TARGET} first year revenue.

**CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP AND PILLARS**

Define 30-second core loop players repeat throughout session. Action loop structure: input action → immediate feedback → visible progress → reward → repeat with variation (match-3: swap tiles → match forms → tiles clear with effects → score increases + special gem appears → cascade matches, 5-10 seconds per cycle maintaining flow state). Longer engagement loops nest core loop: 5-minute gameplay session (match-3: complete 3 levels progressing through themed world → earn stars unlocking new area → feel progression satisfaction → want one more level), 30-minute play session (roguelike: complete dungeon run → unlock new weapon/ability → theory-craft new build → test in next run), multi-hour sessions (MMO: complete quest chain → gain level and new skills → access new zone → repeat with increased challenge). Test core loop in paper prototype or minimal digital version within first 2 weeks identifying fun factor before production investment.

Establish 3 design pillars guiding all decisions. Primary pillar defines core mechanic: precision platforming (tight controls <50ms input lag, predictable physics, skill-based challenges rewarding mastery), strategic depth (rock-paper-scissors combat, positioning matters, counter-play options), creative expression (building systems, character customization, player-generated content). Secondary pillar provides unique hook: procedural generation creating infinite replayability (Hades roguelike dungeons, No Man's Sky universe), narrative innovation (branching storylines with consequence, environmental storytelling, player-driven emergent narratives), social integration (seamless co-op, asynchronous competition, community-created content). Tertiary pillar targets specific audience: accessibility for casual mobile players (one-handed controls, bite-sized sessions, generous progression), hardcore complexity for core gamers (deep systems mastery, competitive ladder, esports potential), nostalgia resonance (retro aesthetics, classic gameplay modernized, franchise continuation).

Design difficulty curve onboarding new players while maintaining engagement. Tutorial teaches one mechanic every 30-60 seconds through gameplay not text: level 1 teaches basic movement by requiring jump across gap (fail state obvious, success immediate), level 2 introduces enemy requiring new attack button, level 3 combines movement + combat organically. Easy entry phase (first 1-2 hours) maintains <15% death rate per encounter allowing experimentation, gradual learning curve (hours 3-10) introduces mechanics one at a time with 30-minute practice before next, mastery phase (10-20+ hours) expects system understanding combining mechanics for advanced challenges. Difficulty modes accommodate skill ranges: easy mode reduces enemy damage 50% and provides extra resources (story enjoyers, accessibility), normal balanced for average player (70% completion rate target), hard mode for challenge seekers (tighter margins, smarter AI, prestige rewards), optional ultra-hard for masochists (one-hit death, limited resources, bragging rights).

**PROGRESSION AND UNLOCKS**

Structure progression maintaining motivation through constant unlocks. Short-term progression provides rewards every 10-15 minutes: loot drops after encounters (random weapon with +5% damage, cosmetic item, crafting material creating anticipation), quest completion rewards (gold, XP, item choice enabling agency), achievement unlocks (cosmetic reward, title, tracked statistic validating playstyle). Medium-term progression unlocks every 30-60 minutes: level-up gaining skill point (allocate to talent tree, immediate power increase, build customization), new ability or weapon type (changes gameplay options, renews engagement), new area or game mode access (environmental variety, mechanical variety). Long-term progression spans 10-20+ hours: prestige systems allowing restart with bonuses (roguelikes permanent unlocks, NG+ with new content, seasonal ladder resets), endgame content unlocking (raids, ranked PvP, challenge modes), narrative conclusion providing closure (final boss, story resolution, credits roll but gameplay continues).

Implement leveling mechanics balancing power fantasy with challenge. XP-based leveling uses exponential curve: level 1→2 requires 100 XP (30 minutes casual play), level 49→50 requires 50,000 XP (10 hours), total 1→50 requires 200 hours providing long-term goal. Skill-based progression rewards mastery not time: improve performance metrics (speedrun times, combo execution, accuracy percentage), unlock higher difficulty tiers, matchmaking rating increases. Hybrid systems combine both: player level provides attribute points (health, damage, defense), skill trees unlock through gameplay achievements (deal 10K damage with fire magic to unlock advanced fire branch), equipment creates horizontal progression (legendary sword different playstyle versus legendary axe, both viable endgame).

Design economy balancing sources and sinks. Currency generation: enemy drops (10-50 gold per kill scaling with zone), quest rewards (500 gold story quest, 50 gold repeatable daily), passive generation (guild base generates 100/hour, investor buildings in idle game). Currency sinks: equipment upgrades (linear: +1 costs 1K, +2 costs 2K, +3 costs 3K totaling 6K for +3), cosmetic purchases (5K-20K per skin creating gold dump for wealthy players), consumable items (100 gold healing potion, 50 uses per session). Balance source/sink ratio 1:1.2 (generate 1000 gold/hour, sinks require 1200 gold/hour optimal progress maintaining scarcity). Secondary currencies create friction: premium currency purchased with real money or earned slowly (1 gem per day login, $1 USD = 100 gems), faction currencies requiring reputation grinding, event-specific currencies creating time pressure.

**MONETIZATION STRATEGY AND ETHICS**

Select business model matching platform and audience. Premium purchase ($20-60) suits PC/console single-player: upfront cost recovers development ($30 indie, $40 mid-tier, $60 AAA matching production value), no additional monetization required (unlocks earned through gameplay), DLC expansions provide ongoing revenue ($15-30 per expansion adding 10-20 hours, season pass bundles at discount). Free-to-play (F2P) dominates mobile and live-service games: 2-5% of players ever pay (100K downloads → 2K-5K paying users), ARPU $3-5 across all players (paying and non-paying), ARPPU $50-100 for paying segment, LTV targets $50-100 total spending per paying player over lifetime. Hybrid models combine approaches: buy-to-play with optional cosmetics (Overwatch $40 base + $10-20 cosmetic skins, Path of Exile free with $20-60 stash tabs), season pass providing content value ($10 per 3-month season, rewards worth $50 if bought separately, completion requires 40-60 hours).

Implement F2P monetization ethically avoiding pay-to-win. Cosmetics-only approach maintains competitive integrity: character skins ($5-20), weapon skins ($10), finishers and emotes ($5), battle pass cosmetic rewards ($10/season, all gameplay impacting items earnable free). Convenience items respect player time without requiring purchase: XP boosters (+50% XP for 24 hours, $2, alternative to 2 hours grinding), inventory expansion (quality of life not required, $5 permanent unlock), crafting time skip (wait 4 hours free or pay $1, balances patience versus payment). Gacha/loot boxes require transparent odds disclosure: legendary drop rate 1%, epic 5%, rare 20%, common 74% clearly displayed, pity system guaranteeing legendary every 100 pulls preventing extreme bad luck, regional regulations complied with (Belgium/Netherlands ban loot boxes, age verification where required).

Design battle pass seasonal engagement. 100-tier progression unlocked through gameplay (not direct purchase): free track provides value (20% of rewards, entices purchase), premium track $10 unlocks full rewards (cosmetics, premium currency, XP boosters), tier skip option $1 per tier whales purchasing entire pass for $100 (acceptable convenience not required). Reward pacing front-loaded: tiers 1-25 require 1 hour each (instant gratification for new buyers), tiers 26-75 require 2 hours (steady progression), tiers 76-100 require 3-4 hours (prestige completion challenge), average player completing 70-80 tiers over 3-month season (incentivizes playing more or buying skips). Season renewal drives recurring revenue: 70% of season 1 buyers purchase season 2 pass (proven value, sunk cost fallacy, FOMO for exclusive rewards), limited-time cosmetics never return creating artificial scarcity.

**LIVE OPERATIONS AND RETENTION**

Establish daily engagement loops habituating players. Login rewards escalate with streak: day 1-7 small rewards (50 gold, consumables, common loot), day 8-14 better rewards (200 gold, crafting materials, rare loot), day 15+ best rewards (500 gold, premium currency, legendary loot, streak breaks reset to day 1 creating anxiety maintaining habit). Daily quests refresh every 24 hours: 3-5 simple quests (play 3 matches, deal 10K damage, complete 1 dungeon), 30-60 minute total completion time, rewards currency and battle pass XP, completion provides dopamine hit. First-win-of-day bonus doubles rewards encouraging at least one session: applies to any game mode, resets midnight UTC, stacks for casual players (missed Monday/Tuesday, get 3x on Wednesday) versus punishes (lost value) based on design philosophy.

Design seasonal events driving engagement spikes. Major events every 6-8 weeks aligned with holidays/themes (Halloween horror event, winter holiday event, summer beach event, anniversary celebration), special limited-time game mode (holiday-themed map, unique ruleset, exclusive rewards), event-specific currency and shop (earn tokens playing event modes, spend in limited-time shop, items never return creating urgency), event battle pass supplements main pass (free for active players, additional paid content option, extra monetization opportunity). Weekly mini-events maintain engagement between major events: weekend XP bonus (+100% XP Saturday/Sunday, encourages playing most active days), limited-time challenges (complete 10 matches with specific character, cosmetic reward, promotes trying new content), rotating game modes (fan favorite modes return temporarily, brings back lapsed players).

Implement social features multiplying retention. Guild/clan systems create community: guild hall shared space (chat, notice board, shared bank for resources), guild missions requiring cooperation (raid bosses, territory control, rewards distributed to members), guild versus guild competition (leaderboards, tournaments, prestige rewards). Friend referral incentivizes organic growth: inviter receives rewards when friend reaches milestones (level 10: 100 gems, level 30: exclusive skin, first purchase: premium currency), both players receive bonus playing together (+10% XP, faster queue times, co-op exclusive content), viral coefficient >1.0 creates exponential growth (each player brings 1.2 friends who stick around). Social proof and FOMO drive engagement: leaderboards showing friend rankings (competitive motivation, visible when friends surpass you), activity feed broadcasting achievements ("PlayerName unlocked Legendary Sword!", creates envy and aspiration), limited-time status symbols (top 100 players receive exclusive title for season, visible flex motivating competition).

**TECHNICAL FOUNDATION AND PLATFORMS**

Choose game engine matching team expertise and target platforms. Unity dominates mobile and indie PC: cross-platform deployment (single codebase exports to iOS/Android/PC/console with minimal changes), large asset store (thousands of plugins, character models, effects accelerating development), C# scripting accessible to programmers, free for revenue <$100K/year ($40/month Pro subscription for bigger studios). Unreal Engine 5 excels for high-fidelity AAA: Nanite virtualized geometry (billions of polygons rendered efficiently, photorealistic environments), Lumen global illumination (real-time dynamic lighting, no baking required), Blueprint visual scripting (designers prototype without code, programmers optimize in C++), 5% royalty after $1M revenue (expensive for hits, free during development). Godot open-source alternative for indies: completely free (no royalties, no subscriptions), lightweight (faster iteration, lower system requirements), GDScript Python-like language (easy learning curve), smaller ecosystem than Unity/Unreal (less third-party assets, more custom development).

Optimize performance targeting platform constraints. PC minimum specs serve broadest audience: GTX 1060 GPU from 2016 (50%+ of Steam users have equivalent or better), i5-8400 CPU, 8GB RAM, 1080p 60fps on low settings, 50GB SSD storage. Recommended specs showcase quality: RTX 3070 GPU, i7-10700 CPU, 16GB RAM, 1440p 60fps or 1080p 120fps high settings, ray tracing optional ultra. Console generation targets: last-gen (PS4/Xbox One) requires aggressive optimization (<5% of budget if supporting, many drop last-gen), current-gen (PS5/Xbox Series X) 4K 60fps performance mode or 4K 30fps quality mode with ray tracing, load times <5 seconds leveraging SSD. Mobile optimization critical for F2P success: iPhone 11+ or Android 10+ minimum (covers 70% active devices), battery drain <5% per 15-minute session (excessive drain causes uninstalls), install size <500MB (cellular download limit without WiFi), thermal management preventing device overheating.

Implement multiplayer infrastructure for scale. Client-server authoritative architecture prevents cheating: client sends inputs to server (move forward, fire weapon), server validates and executes (check movement physics, verify line of sight, calculate damage), server broadcasts results to all clients (player position, damage numbers, death events), clients display smoothly with prediction/interpolation. Dedicated servers for competitive integrity: rent from AWS/GCP game services ($1-2 per CCU per month), automatic scaling handling launch spikes (10 servers normally, 100 during weekend events, 1000 at launch), regional deployment reducing latency (US-East, US-West, EU-West, Asia-Pacific servers <100ms ping for 95% players). Peer-to-peer option for casual co-op: host player runs server (saves infrastructure costs, acceptable for PvE), host migration prevents disconnection catastrophe (new host elected when original leaves), NAT punchthrough enables connections (STUN/TURN servers relay if direct connection fails).

**TESTING AND BALANCING**

Structure playtesting validating design decisions. Internal QA testing focuses on bugs: regression testing (new patch doesn't break existing features, 100+ test cases per build), edge case testing (use items at full inventory, pause during cutscene, unexpected input combinations), performance testing (60fps minimum maintained, memory usage <4GB, no crashes over 4-hour session), compatibility testing (controller support, different resolutions, graphics settings, console certification requirements). Focus group playtesting evaluates fun and onboarding: recruit target audience (10-20 players per session, compensate $50-100 for 2-3 hours), observe without interrupting (watch where players struggle, frustrated expressions, comments to friends), interview afterward (what was fun, what was confusing, would you recommend to friend, net promoter score), iterate rapidly (test every 2 weeks during production, address top 3 pain points each sprint).

Balance game economy through simulation and telemetry. Simulated playthroughs model progression: script AI player behavior (completes quests, grinds enemies, purchases upgrades), run 10,000 simulations with variance (some focus main story, others explore, whales spending $100+), analyze results (50th percentile player reaches endgame at 80 hours target, 95th percentile at 50 hours, economy remains interesting throughout). Live telemetry monitors real players: heatmaps show where players die most (difficult encounters tuned or telegraphed better), weapon usage statistics identify overpowered weapons (nerf sword used by 80% of players, buff unused hammer), purchase analytics guide pricing (experimental $4.99 skin sells 40% more than $5.99 despite 20% less revenue, price elasticity insights).

Iterate balance through patches post-launch. Hotfix schedule addresses critical issues: game-breaking bugs (item duplication exploits, progression blockers, server crashes) patched within 24-48 hours, emergency maintenance (take servers offline, deploy fix, compensate players with apology currency). Bi-weekly balance patches maintain meta: nerf overperforming strategies by 5-10% at a time (avoid over-nerfing creating unplayability, gradual adjustments encourage adaptation), buff underutilized content (forgotten weapons, unpopular characters, unused abilities receiving small buffs testing viability), communicate changes transparently (patch notes explain reasoning: "sword damage reduced 10% because 80% pick rate indicates dominance, monitoring impact"). Major quarterly rebalances allow systemic changes: rework failed mechanics (replace unpopular crafting system with streamlined version, redesign confusing skill trees), address power creep (increase enemy difficulty in old content scaling with player power), seasonal meta shifts (intentionally promote different strategies each season maintaining freshness).

Deliver game development as:

1. **GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT** - Core loop definition, progression systems, economy design, level flow, narrative structure, technical specifications (20-40 pages)

2. **PLAYABLE PROTOTYPE** - Vertical slice demonstrating core loop (15-30 minutes gameplay), placeholder art acceptable, feel and pacing validated through testing

3. **BALANCE SPREADSHEETS** - Economy tuning (currency generation/sinks), progression curves (XP requirements, difficulty scaling), combat balance (weapon damage, enemy health)

4. **MONETIZATION MODEL** - Revenue projections, pricing strategy, conversion funnel, LTV calculations, ethical guidelines, A/B testing plan

5. **PRODUCTION ASSETS** - Final art and audio, optimized builds for platforms, localized content (EFIGS minimum, CJK for global), QA test plan

6. **LIVE OPS ROADMAP** - Content calendar (seasons, events, updates), community management plan, analytics dashboard, patch schedule, 2-year vision

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Mobile Match-3 F2P
**Prompt:** Design casual match-3 puzzle game for iOS/Android targeting 25-45 year old casual players with 5-person team, $500K budget, 12-month development achieving D1 45%, D7 20%, D30 10% retention and $0.85 ARPDAU.

**Expected Output:** Core loop: swap adjacent tiles → 3+ matching tiles clear → special gems cascade → earn points and stars → progress through level (30-60 seconds per level, session 15-20 minutes completing 5-10 levels). Pillars: (1) accessible match-3 mechanics (no skill ceiling, relaxing not stressful, one-handed portrait mode, generous time limits), (2) meta-progression unlocking areas (linear world map 500+ levels, themed worlds every 50 levels with unique tile sets and mechanics, storyline following character journey), (3) social integration (friend leaderboards per level showing high scores, lives gifting system, competitive weekly tournaments). Progression: complete level earning 1-3 stars based on score (1 star minimum to progress, 3 stars for perfection enabling completionist goals), 10 levels unlocks new area (environmental variety sustaining interest), power-ups unlocked (level 5: rocket clears row, level 15: bomb clears 3x3, level 30: rainbow clears all of one color), soft currency (coins) purchases pre-game boosters or continues. Monetization: F2P with lives system (5 lives regenerate 1 per 30 minutes or purchase 5 for $0.99, wait or pay creating revenue), coin shop (100 coins $0.99, 500 coins $3.99 best value, 2000 coins $9.99 for whales), remove ads $2.99 permanent (ad-supported free tier, premium removes annoyance), special offers ($4.99 starter pack with 1000 coins + boosters + ad-free 1 week, limited-time discount events). Target 3% conversion rate (100K downloads → 3K paying users), $0.10 ARPDAU from ads, $0.75 ARPDAU from IAP totaling $0.85, average paying user LTV $50 over 6 months. Daily engagement: daily login reward (day 1-7 coins/boosters escalating, day 7 premium currency, resets encouraging daily check-in), daily challenge level (unique objective earning bonus coins, changes every 24 hours, FOMO for missing day), spin wheel free daily (random reward: coins, boosters, lives creating excitement). Events: weekend tournaments (play designated levels, highest score wins, rewards tiered by rank: top 1% legendary booster, top 10% epic booster, participation coins), seasonal events (Halloween-themed levels October, Christmas December, limited-time tile skins and backgrounds exclusive to event), alliance/guild system (join 50-player team, team tournaments, shared lives pool, chat fostering community increasing retention 50%). Balance: difficulty curve gradual (levels 1-20 tutorial difficulty 95% completion, levels 21-50 easy 85% completion, levels 51+ varied difficulty 60-80% average, intentional difficulty spike every 20 levels monetizing frustration 40% completion), power-up balance (rocket 15% more effective than bomb but costs 2x coins, rainbow 5x power costs 5x price premium luxury), economy (average 100 coins earned per hour, boosters cost 50-200 coins, whales spending $100+ have infinite continues). Technical: Unity 2023 LTS, C# scripting, TextMesh Pro UI, 2D sprite rendering (low battery drain, runs on iPhone 8+/Android 8+), install size 150MB (compressed textures, lightweight framework), analytics via GameAnalytics tracking funnel (download → tutorial complete 70% target → level 10 reached 40% → first IAP 3%), A/B testing difficulty curves, live ops tools (change shop offers server-side, deploy events without app update, feature flags enabling gradual rollout). Development: month 1-3 core loop prototype (paper prototype tested internally, digital Unity build iOS/Android, 20 levels playable validating fun), month 4-6 meta progression (world map, 100 levels, power-up system, economy tuning), month 7-9 live ops features (daily quests, events system, shop, IAP integration, ads SDK), month 10-12 content production (500 levels designed, art finalized, localization EFIGS, soft launch Philippines/Canada testing metrics, global launch). Post-launch: new levels weekly (15 levels per week maintaining content treadmill, art pipeline creating 60 levels/month, difficulty algorithm procedurally adjusting), events monthly (holiday themed, new mechanics, exclusive rewards), quarterly feature updates (social features, new power-ups, UI improvements addressing feedback), year 2 vision (PvP mode, clan wars, prestige system resetting progress with bonuses).

### Example 2: PC Indie Roguelike
**Prompt:** Design roguelike dungeon crawler for PC/Steam targeting core gamers with 5-person indie team, $300K budget, 18-month development achieving 89% positive Steam reviews and 200K sales at $19.99.

**Expected Output:** Core loop: explore procedural dungeon → encounter enemies in rooms → defeat using action combat → collect randomized loot upgrades → progress deeper with increased power and challenge → inevitable death → permanent unlocks and knowledge → retry with new build (run duration 30-90 minutes, session multiple runs iterating strategy). Pillars: (1) deep build variety (50+ weapons with unique movesets, 100+ passive items synergizing unexpectedly, theorycrafting between runs), (2) skill-based combat (dodge rolls with i-frames, parry mechanics, attack animation commitment punishing button mashing, pattern recognition for enemies), (3) meaningful progression (permanent unlocks add new items to pool, knowledge of enemy patterns and synergies persist, player skill improvement most important). Progression: in-run progression (level up choosing between 3 random upgrades, find weapons in chests, shops spend gold accumulated during run, boss rewards powerful items, each floor 10-15 minutes), meta-progression (unlock new starting classes with different stats/weapons, unlock new items appearing in future runs, shortcuts to later floors after first clear, bestiary tracking defeated enemies revealing weaknesses), difficulty scaling (first floor baby easy teaching mechanics, floor 5 boss difficulty spike 30% death rate, floor 10 final boss mastery check 60% death rate first attempts). Combat balance: weapon variety (fast dagger 20 DPS high mobility, slow hammer 60 DPS high stagger, ranged bow 30 DPS safety, magic 40 DPS area damage, all viable playstyles), enemy design (telegraphed attacks 0.5s wind-up allowing reaction, punish patterns encouraging different counters, elite variants with modifiers creating emergent challenges), boss fights (3-phase fights introducing mechanics progressively, no RNG instant kills, skill ceiling allows no-hit runs). Monetization: premium purchase $19.99 (recovering $300K budget requires 15K sales at 70% Steam cut = $10/sale, break-even at 30K sales, profit at 200K sales $1.4M revenue), no DLC planned (complete experience at launch, free content updates building goodwill), optional cosmetic DLC $4.99 (soundtrack, artbook supporting developers, released 6 months post-launch). Replayability: procedural generation (room layouts randomized, enemy placement varied, item spawns different each run ensuring no two runs identical), seeded runs (daily challenge same seed all players, leaderboards for score/time, community sharing interesting seeds), unlockable characters (beat game with starting character unlocking 5 additional with unique mechanics, each changing playstyle significantly), difficulty modifiers (beat game unlocking hard mode, heat system adding optional challenges for better rewards, endless mode testing limits). Technical: Unity 2023, 2D pixel art (nostalgic aesthetic, 4-person art team manageable scope), controller support primary (designed for gamepad, keyboard/mouse secondary), 60fps locked (action gameplay demands responsiveness), mod support (Steam Workshop integration, expose JSON data for community tweaking drop rates/stats, allow custom items and enemies). Development: month 1-6 core combat feel (prototype combat mechanics paper testing, program 10 weapons and 20 enemies, iterate until combat feels tight and responsive, internal playtesting weekly), month 7-12 systems and content (procedural generation algorithms, 30+ items, 5 biomes with distinct enemies and bosses, meta progression unlocks, economy balancing through simulation), month 13-18 polish and content expansion (expand to 50 weapons and 100 items, particle effects and juice, soundtrack composition, 20-hour closed beta Steam playtest gathering feedback, bug fixes and balance iteration). Marketing: build wishlist pre-launch (Twitter devlog weekly showing combat GIFs, Reddit gamedev posts, Steam page 6 months early, demo at Steam Next Fest 50K wishlists), influencer outreach (send keys to 50 roguelike streamers/YouTubers, encourage sharing interesting runs, streamer audience converts 5-10%), launch discount (10% off first week encouraging impulse purchases, review copies to press week early, launch day coordinating influencers all streaming simultaneously). Post-launch: free content updates (month 3: new biome and 10 items, month 6: new playable character and hard mode, month 12: endless mode and daily challenges, maintain community engagement), bug fixes (weekly patches first month, bi-weekly afterward, active Discord communication), modding support (Steam Workshop 3 months post-launch, community-created content extending longevity, most popular mods integrated officially with credit).

### Example 3: AAA Open-World RPG
**Prompt:** Design open-world action RPG for PS5/Xbox Series X/PC targeting core gamers with 150-person team, $50M budget, 4-year development achieving 85 Metacritic and 5M copies sold at $70.

**Expected Output:** Core loop: explore vast open world (15km² seamless map) → discover quests and locations → engage in action combat encounters → loot gear and progress character → upgrade abilities and equipment → tackle higher difficulty content (loop 30-60 minutes), session 2-6 hours (complete quest chains, explore region, boss encounter). Pillars: (1) player-driven exploration (no quest markers, environmental clues guide discovery, verticality enabling climbing and gliding, hidden secrets rewarding curiosity), (2) dynamic combat (weapon-based movesets, dodge/parry timing, build customization via skill trees and gear, difficulty scaling with player skill), (3) emergent storytelling (player choices affect world state, faction reputation systems, multiple quest solutions, character relationship dynamics). Progression: main story 40-hour critical path (linear narrative arc 50 missions, cinematic production values motion-captured performances, branching choices 3 major paths affecting ending), side content 60+ hours (100 side quests character-driven stories, 30 world events dynamic encounters, 20 dungeons multi-floor challenges, collectibles lore codex 500 entries), character progression (XP leveling 1-50 taking 80 hours, skill trees 3 specializations with 50 nodes each, equipment rarity common to legendary with randomized stats and set bonuses). Combat: real-time action (lock-on targeting, light/heavy attacks comboing, dodge with i-frames 0.3s window, parry with 0.2s window, punish windows after successful parries), weapon variety (swords, axes, spears, bows, magic each unique playstyle, dual-wielding for speed builds, two-handed for damage, sword and shield for defense), build diversity (strength scaling for melee, dexterity for finesse, intelligence for magic, hybrid builds viable, respec allowed at towns encouraging experimentation). Economy: gold from enemies/quests/treasure (10,000 gold accumulated by endgame), equipment shops (tiered prices: common 100g, rare 1000g, epic 5000g, legendary 20000g), upgrade materials (rare drops required for weapon enchantment, grinding specific enemies for best gear, player auction house trading). Monetization: premium $70 base game (complete 100+ hour experience, no cut content), deluxe $90 (early access 3 days, cosmetic armor sets, digital artbook and soundtrack), season pass $30 (3 DLC expansions adding 10 hours each over year 1, $15 separately, buy together save 33%), cosmetic packs $5-10 post-launch (transmog skins, mount variants, no stat advantages). Live service elements: seasonal events (free limited-time quests during holidays, themed rewards, replayable annually), NG+ mode (replay with increased difficulty and exclusive rewards, maintain character progression), photo mode (robust tools for virtual photography, community sharing, free marketing via social media). Technical: Unreal Engine 5 (Nanite geometry enabling film-quality assets, Lumen global illumination dynamic lighting, Niagara VFX for magic effects), performance targets (4K 30fps quality mode with ray tracing, 1440p 60fps performance mode, PC scalable 1080p-4K with DLSS/FSR upscaling), SSD optimization (<5s fast travel, seamless world streaming no loading screens). Development: year 1 pre-production (finalize design pillars, vertical slice 30-minute demo proving core loop fun, engine customization for open world), year 2 production ramp (block out full world greybox, program all combat systems, narrative script first draft 200K words), year 3 full production (art production 10K unique assets, motion capture 15 hours cinematics, voice recording 500K words, systems integration), year 4 polish and optimization (bug fixing 5000+ logged issues, performance optimization 60fps consistent, playtesting 100+ external testers, balance tuning, certification approval). Marketing: announcement trailer (E3 equivalent show, 2 years pre-launch building hype), quarterly dev diaries (transparency building community trust, gameplay reveals, feature deep-dives), influencer program (early access 50 top RPG creators, embargo lift coordinated launch day, organic coverage worth $5M equivalent ads), review embargo (lift 1 week early confident in 85+ Metacritic, pre-orders spike on positive reviews). Post-launch roadmap: month 1-3 bug fixes and QoL (patch weekly addressing top community requests, add color-blind modes and accessibility options, performance improvements), month 4-6 DLC 1 (new region 15 hours content, level cap increase 50→60, new weapon types), month 7-12 DLC 2-3 (conclude story threads, endgame raid content, transmog system), year 2 complete edition ($40 base game + all DLC, platform expansion to Switch 2 if technically viable).
