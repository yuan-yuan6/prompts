# Wealth Management Strategy - Complete Overview

This comprehensive wealth management system has been divided into 3 focused parts for easier navigation and implementation. Use this guide to understand the structure and select the right section for your needs.

## Quick Wealth Navigation Prompt
Navigate wealth strategy for [net worth level: <$500K/mass affluent $500K-$2M/HNW $2M-$10M/UHNW $10M+]. Priority: [foundation/investment/tax/retirement/estate/insurance]. Approach: comprehensive (32 weeks) or targeted (4-12 weeks). Start: Part 1 for foundation → Part 2 for tax/retirement/estate → Part 3 for risk/implementation. Key integration: investment drives tax, retirement informs allocation, estate requires insurance.

## Quick Start

Navigate the Wealth Management Strategy in 4 steps:

1. **Identify Your Wealth Level** - Choose based on net worth:
   - **Mass Affluent ($500K-$2M):** Focus on Part 1 (Foundation & Investment) + essential coverage from Part 3
   - **High Net Worth ($2M-$10M):** Use Part 1 (sophisticated strategies) + Part 2 (trusts & estate) + Part 3 (comprehensive insurance)
   - **Ultra-High Net Worth ($10M+):** Implement all three parts fully with advanced strategies (dynasty trusts, international planning, family office)
   - **Starting Out (<$500K):** Begin with Part 1 (goal setting, cash flow, systematic investing)

2. **Define Your Immediate Priority** - What's most pressing?
   - **Foundation/Goals:** Part 1, Section 1 for SMART goals, cash flow analysis, net worth building
   - **Investment Portfolio:** Part 1, Section 2 for asset allocation, portfolio construction, rebalancing
   - **Tax Optimization:** Part 2, Section 3 for tax-efficient investing, Roth conversions, business strategies
   - **Retirement Planning:** Part 2, Section 4 for income planning, Social Security optimization, distributions
   - **Estate Planning:** Part 2, Section 5 for trusts, wealth transfer, succession planning
   - **Risk/Insurance:** Part 3, Section 6 for life, disability, property, liability coverage

3. **Choose Your Implementation Approach** - Two paths available:
   - **Comprehensive (32 weeks):** Sequential implementation through all three parts following the 4-phase timeline in Part 3
   - **Targeted (4-12 weeks):** Jump to specific section for immediate need, then expand to other areas
   - **Modular:** Address one domain at a time (investment → tax → retirement → estate → insurance)

4. **Understand the Integration Points** - How parts connect:
   - Investment strategy (Part 1) drives tax optimization needs (Part 2)
   - Retirement goals (Part 2) inform asset allocation decisions (Part 1)
   - Estate planning (Part 2) requires insurance solutions (Part 3)
   - All strategies need implementation roadmap (Part 3)

**Pro Tip:** For new comprehensive plans, start with Part 1 to establish foundation and investment strategy, then add Part 2 for tax/retirement/estate optimization, and complete with Part 3 for risk management and implementation. For focused needs (e.g., "optimize my taxes" or "plan my retirement"), jump directly to the relevant part.

## System Architecture

The wealth management strategy is organized into three interconnected parts:
