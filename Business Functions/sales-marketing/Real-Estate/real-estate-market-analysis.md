# Real Estate Market Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to analyze real estate markets with reliable data, sound methods, and actionable outputs for investment or development decisions.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess real estate market analysis readiness for [MARKET] and asset type [ASSET_TYPE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Scope & decision clarity, (2) Data sources & quality, (3) Supply/demand modeling, (4) Competitive & comps analysis, (5) Risk & scenario planning, (6) Reporting & actionability. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Decision Clarity
- 1 — Initial: Research questions are vague; outputs not tied to decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Decisions and hypotheses documented; scope and success criteria defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Analysis is decision-grade; scope is prioritized and repeatable.

### 2) Data Sources & Quality
- 1 — Initial: Data is fragmented; definitions inconsistent; gaps common.
- 3 — Defined: Data sources identified; QA routines; assumptions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted and monitored; updates are timely and consistent.

### 3) Supply/Demand Modeling
- 1 — Initial: Modeling is simplistic; drivers not captured.
- 3 — Defined: Demand drivers and supply pipeline modeled; scenarios defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Models are calibrated and validated; forecasts improve predictably.

### 4) Competitive & Comps Analysis
- 1 — Initial: Comps are anecdotal; competitive set unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Comparable selection criteria; competitive benchmarking documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Comps framework is repeatable; insights directly inform strategy.

### 5) Risk & Scenario Planning
- 1 — Initial: Risks are not documented; sensitivity analysis missing.
- 3 — Defined: Key risks and sensitivities identified; scenario set defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scenarios are used routinely; risk mitigations are explicit and tracked.

### 6) Reporting & Actionability
- 1 — Initial: Outputs are descriptive; actions and owners unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Recommendations tie to decisions; format and cadence defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Insights translate into clear actions; outcomes are tracked and improved.

## Deliverables
- Market analysis readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Market definition and decision questions
- Data source inventory and QA plan
- Model outputs (supply/demand, comps, scenarios)
- Actionable recommendations with assumptions and risks

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [MARKET]: City/region/zip cluster
- [ASSET_TYPE]: Multifamily, office, industrial, retail, etc.
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Forecast horizon
- [DATA_SOURCES]: Listings, permits, leases, macro data
- [SCENARIOS]: Base/upside/downside
- [KEY_ASSUMPTIONS]: Rent growth, vacancy, cap rates

## Example (Condensed)
- Market: Secondary metro multifamily expansion
- Scores (1–5): Scope 3; Data 2; Modeling 2; Comps 3; Risk 2; Actionability 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize data definitions; build scenario model; align outputs to investment committee decisions
