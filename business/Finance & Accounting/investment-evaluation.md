# Investment Evaluation Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive investment evaluation strategies covering ROI analysis, NPV calculations, and risk assessment to support informed investment decisions and capital allocation optimization.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
"Evaluate a $5M manufacturing facility expansion for IndustrialCorp. Expected incremental revenue: $2M/year for 10 years, operating margin 40%, WACC 10%, implementation timeline 18 months. Analyze NPV, IRR, payback period, and assess market, operational, and financial risks. Compare to alternative investments."

### When to Use
- Evaluating capital expenditure projects and investments
- Analyzing acquisition targets or partnership opportunities
- Prioritizing project portfolios and allocating capital budgets
- Assessing R&D projects or technology investments
- Supporting investment committee decisions with financial analysis

### 3-Step Workflow
1. **Gather Investment Details**: Define investment type, amount, timeline, and expected benefits; collect financial projections, cost estimates, market data, and identify key risks and assumptions
2. **Generate Evaluation**: Input parameters into the template to create comprehensive analysis including DCF/NPV, ROI metrics, risk assessment, sensitivity analysis, and strategic value evaluation
3. **Decide and Monitor**: Review financial metrics and strategic fit, compare alternatives, make investment decision, establish monitoring framework, and conduct post-investment performance reviews

### Time Estimate
- Data collection and analysis setup: 2-4 hours
- Evaluation generation and scenario analysis: 3-5 hours
- Total: 5-9 hours per major investment evaluated
