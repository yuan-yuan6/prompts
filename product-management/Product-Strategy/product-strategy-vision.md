## Best Practices

### Strategy Development
1. **Start with customer insight, not technology** - Understand problems before designing solutions
2. **Make strategic choices** - Say no to opportunities that don't fit
3. **Be opinionated** - Bland strategies that try to please everyone fail
4. **Test assumptions early** - Identify and validate riskiest assumptions first
5. **Think in systems** - Consider flywheels and network effects

### Vision Crafting
1. **Make it inspiring** - Should energize team and attract talent
2. **Make it specific** - "Change the world" is not a vision
3. **Make it believable** - Stretch goal but achievable with execution
4. **Paint the future** - Help people visualize success
5. **Connect to purpose** - Tie to company mission and values

### Positioning
1. **Own a category** - Be #1 in a specific category vs #3 in broad category
2. **Different, not better** - Differentiation beats feature parity
3. **Focus on ICP** - Narrowly define ideal customer, broader appeal comes later
4. **Evidence-based** - Back claims with proof points and case studies
5. **Consistent messaging** - Align all GTM teams on positioning

### Metrics & Goals
1. **North Star first** - Single metric that captures value creation
2. **Input metrics matter** - Lead indicators you can influence
3. **Segments, not aggregates** - Different metrics for different customer segments
4. **Acceptable tradeoffs** - Be explicit about what you're optimizing for
5. **Review cadence** - Weekly/monthly reviews, not just quarterly

### Stakeholder Management
1. **Create alignment early** - Get exec buy-in before detailed planning
2. **Tell a story** - Narrative beats slides
3. **Show, don't just tell** - Prototypes and demos make strategy tangible
4. **Address concerns head-on** - Don't ignore elephants in the room
5. **Update regularly** - Strategy is living document, not one-time exercise

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **"Boiling the ocean"** - Trying to serve everyone vs focused strategy
✅ Instead: Choose specific target segment and nail it before expanding

❌ **Feature lists as strategy** - Listing features instead of strategic choices
✅ Instead: Articulate strategic pillars and how they compound over time

❌ **Competitor-driven** - Copying competitor features without differentiation
✅ Instead: Play your own game - build on unique insights and advantages

❌ **Vague vision** - "Best-in-class" and "world-class" are meaningless
✅ Instead: Specific, measurable outcomes and painted future state

❌ **Strategy without tradeoffs** - Trying to do everything
✅ Instead: Explicit choices about what NOT to do

❌ **Metrics without context** - Goals without understanding baseline and capacity
✅ Instead: Realistic targets based on current state and growth capacity

❌ **Static strategy** - Set it and forget it
✅ Instead: Regular review and adaptation as you learn
