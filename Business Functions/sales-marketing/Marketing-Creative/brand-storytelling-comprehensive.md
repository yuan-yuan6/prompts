# Comprehensive Brand Storytelling Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to develop and scale a comprehensive brand storytelling system across touchpoints: narrative architecture, voice, asset library, governance, and measurement.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess comprehensive brand storytelling readiness for [BRAND_NAME] ([ORGANIZATION_TYPE]) targeting [PRIMARY_AUDIENCE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Purpose & differentiation, (2) Audience/community insight, (3) Narrative architecture & story library, (4) Voice/tone system & channel adaptation, (5) Operating model & governance, (6) Measurement & evolution. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Purpose & Differentiation
- 1 — Initial: Purpose/positioning unclear; storytelling is generic; values aren’t operational.
- 3 — Defined: Purpose, values, and positioning are documented; story themes map to strategy.
- 5 — Optimized: Story system reinforces differentiation; themes and proof points are actively maintained.

### 2) Audience/Community Insight
- 1 — Initial: Little research; community unknown; cultural context ignored.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and communities mapped; motivations and tensions documented; research informs briefs.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous insight pipeline; community feedback loops; cultural nuance handled with intent.

### 3) Narrative Architecture & Story Library
- 1 — Initial: No coherent narrative; assets are one-off; inconsistent story arcs.
- 3 — Defined: Narrative architecture (origin, values, transformation, proof); story library organized by use.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular assets across lengths and formats; evidence integrated; versioning and reuse are frictionless.

### 4) Voice/Tone System & Channel Adaptation
- 1 — Initial: Voice is inconsistent; tone is improvised; channel adaptations feel disconnected.
- 3 — Defined: Voice/tone guidelines with examples; channel adaptations follow rules.
- 5 — Optimized: Voice system is trained and audited; adaptations are fast while preserving identity.

### 5) Operating Model & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; approvals subjective; rollout and training absent.
- 3 — Defined: Roles and decision rights; review process; enablement materials exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; teams self-serve; quality is maintained through principles and evidence.

### 6) Measurement & Evolution
- 1 — Initial: No measurement plan; stories are not tested; iteration is random.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework and qualitative feedback signals; experimentation plan; learnings captured.
- 5 — Optimized: Story performance is measured end-to-end; feedback loops trigger updates; coherence remains stable.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence-based notes
- Narrative architecture and message pillars
- Voice/tone system with channel examples
- Story library taxonomy (formats, owners, versioning)
- Enablement plan (training, templates, governance)
- Measurement framework and 90-day roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [ORGANIZATION_TYPE]: B2C, B2B, nonprofit, public sector, etc.
- [PRIMARY_AUDIENCE]: Primary audience/community
- [CORE_PURPOSE]: Brand purpose/why
- [BRAND_VALUES]: Values expressed through actions
- [PROOF_POINTS]: Evidence supporting claims
- [TOUCHPOINTS]: Channels and moments where stories appear

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Heritage Coffee Roasters
- Objective: Modernize the brand narrative while preserving authenticity
- Scores (1–5): Purpose 4; Insight 2; Library 2; Voice 3; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Limited audience/community insight; weak story library reuse; inconsistent governance
- 90-day priorities: Build insight pipeline; create modular story library; launch enablement + review principles
