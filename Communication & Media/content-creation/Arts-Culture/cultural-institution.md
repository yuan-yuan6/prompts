## Usage Example

### Regional History Museum — Institutional Assessment and Strategic Repositioning

**Context:** Riverside Cultural Museum assessing readiness for major strategic shift and capital campaign. 45-year-old institution in Midwestern city of 250,000 serving 3-county region. Collections of 8,500 objects spanning local indigenous heritage (pre-contact through contemporary), regional settler history (1800s-present), and regional visual arts (primarily 20th-21st century). Current annual attendance 28,000 (pre-pandemic high of 35,000). Operating budget $1.8M with 18 FTE staff. Museum considering $8M capital campaign for building expansion adding 12,000 sq ft (current facility 22,000 sq ft built 1978), collection storage upgrade, and endowment growth to $6M (current $2.3M). Board wants readiness assessment before launching campaign publicly.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 2.9/5.0** (Developing, approaching Established threshold)
- **Collection Management & Preservation: 2.4/5.0** — Significant deficiencies. Preservation infrastructure inadequate (storage at 85% capacity, climate control unreliable with 4 system failures in past 2 years causing temperature spikes, no environmental monitoring system, pest evidence in 3 storage areas, fire suppression covers only 60% of storage, disaster plan outdated from 2011 never tested). Cataloging 72% complete (2,380 objects lacking database records, backlog from 1990s accessions, provenance documentation weak for 40% of collection particularly indigenous materials creating legal and ethical concerns, condition reports exist for only 55% of objects, digital photography completed for only 45% of collection limiting online access and research). Conservation expertise limited (no staff conservator, consultant conservator hired only reactively for crisis interventions averaging $12K annually, preventive conservation program minimal, treatment documentation inconsistent, conservation backlog estimated at 400+ objects needing intervention, no conservation lab space, ethical considerations for indigenous materials not consistently addressed risking relationships with tribal communities). Acquisition strategy somewhat defined (collecting policy from 2015 broadly appropriate, acquisitions committee functional, but due diligence processes informal relying on director knowledge not systematic title research, deaccessioning policy on paper but not practiced in 12 years leading to collection bloat, storage capacity crisis limiting ability to accept donations appropriately). Legal and ethical compliance concerning (title documentation adequate for post-1950 objects but gaps for earlier materials, NAGPRA compliance partially complete with initial inventory done but consultations stalled due to staff turnover and tribal relationship challenges, several indigenous objects of questionable provenance not actively being addressed, loan agreements standardized but insurance valuations outdated). Collections accessibility limited (no online database—only internal access, 8% of collection digitized far below 40-50% sector norms, research access welcomed but inadequate staff support limiting service, objects rarely available for exhibition due to conservation concerns or inability to locate in disorganized storage, minimal loans out due to condition and insurance issues). Storage planning critical (85% capacity with 5-7 years before full at current acquisition rate, storage conditions rated 5/10 by consultant, compact storage appropriate for only 30% of collection, specialized storage needs for textiles and works on paper unmet, expansion essential within 3-5 years).

**Strengths:** Strong regional focus and niche positioning (collection relevance to community clear and valued, indigenous heritage materials significant and rare regionally, strong representation of underrecognized regional artists providing unique value), acquisition discipline improving with fewer but better objects added recently, research interest from university partners attracted by specialized collection areas despite access challenges, community attachment to institution with long history and family memories creating goodwill foundation.

**Critical Gap:** Collection care crisis—inadequate storage, environmental control failures, conservation backlog, and incomplete documentation threaten collection integrity and community trust. Failure to address risks accreditation, insurability, loan eligibility, and donor confidence before campaign.

- **Exhibition & Programming: 3.4/5.0** — Relative strength. Exhibition quality good (narratives clear and accessible, object selection appropriate, interpretive methods mix traditional and hands-on effectively, spatial design competent within facility constraints, lighting adequate but aging, labels meet readability standards, accessibility compliance adequate with wheelchair access and large-print labels but no audio descriptions or ASL, installations safe and professional, evaluation informal through comment cards only). Educational programming strong (school programs robust with 12,000 student visits annually and curriculum-aligned programming earning teacher loyalty, family programs popular with 45 events annually averaging 125 participants, adult education modest with 8 lectures annually 40-60 attendance, community programs limited but growing including senior programs and new immigrant family days, docent corps of 28 well-trained and dedicated, program evaluation basic through surveys showing 4.3/5 satisfaction, accessibility considerations growing with 2 sensory-friendly events piloted successfully, school partnerships with 47 district schools formalized). Cultural programming appropriate (regional artists featured in 3-4 exhibitions annually connecting contemporary and historical practice, indigenous cultural events twice annually co-produced with tribal cultural centers though more opportunity exists, community traditions celebrated through annual events like Harvest Festival and Winter Celebration attracting 500-800). Scholarly contribution modest (exhibition catalogs rare with only 3 in past decade due to budget constraints, staff publications infrequent, symposia hosted occasionally, collection-based research by external scholars welcomed but infrequent, contribution to field knowledge limited by capacity not quality). Innovation emerging (digital pilot project creating online exhibition attracted 2,300 views showing appetite, participatory elements in recent exhibition tested successfully, collaboration with university digital humanities lab exploring virtual reality application to indigenous collection pending funding, responsive programming during pandemic shifted online effectively demonstrating agility).

**Strengths:** Education programming excellence as institutional strength (strong school relationships, skilled educators, community-responsive programs, foundation for growth), exhibition quality competitive with peer institutions creating credibility, indigenous partnerships growing and authentic though needing investment to deepen, innovation mindset with entrepreneurial staff willing to experiment within constraints.

**Moderate Gap:** Limited scholarly contribution and publication reducing sector visibility and knowledge impact—opportunity to elevate through partnerships, digital projects, or focused capacity building in areas of collection strength.

- **Visitor Experience & Engagement: 3.1/5.0** — Mixed performance. Audience diversity improving but gaps remain (visitor demographics: 78% white (community 71% white), 9% African American (community 14%), 6% Latino (community 11%), 4% Asian (community 3%), 3% indigenous (community 1% enrolled tribal members but 4% indigenous heritage), median income $58K (community $52K showing economic accessibility better than ethnic), age distribution skewed older with 58% over 50 and only 12% 18-35). Satisfaction strong (visitor surveys show 4.2/5 overall satisfaction, 82% would recommend, specific strengths in staff friendliness 4.6/5 and program quality 4.4/5, weaknesses in facility quality 3.1/5 and food service 2.8/5, response rate 18% adequate, comparison to regional museums shows competitive performance, addressing facility concerns through capital campaign appropriately prioritized). Accessibility provisions adequate (physical accessibility with elevator, ramps, accessible restrooms meeting ADA, sensory accessibility limited to large-print labels only—no audio, tactile, or ASL programming except 2 pilots, cognitive accessibility basic, program accessibility good with wheelchair seating and materials alternatives, website accessibility fails WCAG standards needing remediation, staff training on disability minimal, consultation with disability community occurred once in 2019 not sustained). Engagement metrics moderate (average visit duration 78 minutes appropriate for facility size, repeat visitation 34% annually indicating loyalty, membership 980 households with 68% retention, program attendance averages 72% capacity indicating appropriate sizing and demand, social media following 4,200 Facebook, 1,800 Instagram with engagement rates 3.2% and 2.1% respectively—adequate not strong, email list 6,500 with 28% open rate and 4% click rate above sector averages showing quality communications, donation rate 8% of visitors including small gift boxes throughout facility). Facility quality limiting (building condition rated 6/10 by facilities consultant with deferred maintenance estimated $680K, galleries adequate but aging with inflexible layouts and tired finishes, public amenities minimal—restrooms small and dated, limited seating, no coat check, café/food service very limited with vending machines only consistently rated lowest in satisfaction, wayfinding adequate but not great, back-of-house space 40% of needed based on staffing and collections creating operational inefficiency, energy inefficiency with HVAC systems past useful life increasing operating costs, security adequate with cameras and guards but outdated systems). Digital presence developing (website redesigned 2020 with improved user experience but lacking online collection database, virtual exhibitions nonexistent until pandemic pilot showed 300% increase in digital engagement, social media consistent but not strategic with organic posting only no paid promotion, email communications valued by subscribers with quality content, no e-commerce except memberships—unable to sell tickets or programs online limiting accessibility, virtual programming expanded during pandemic with Zoom programs but not sustained post-reopening despite audience demand).

**Strengths:** Strong visitor satisfaction despite facility limitations demonstrates program and staff quality overcoming environment, membership loyalty showing committed base to build from, educational programming creating positive experiences and word-of-mouth, pandemic digital pivoting revealed capabilities and audience appetite, accessibility commitment growing with pilot programs showing path forward.

**Critical Gap:** Facility quality significantly limiting experience and capacity—documented as primary satisfaction weakness and barrier to increasing attendance, addressing through capital campaign appropriately prioritized. Digital presence underdeveloped relative to community expectations and competitive environment, missing accessibility provisions excluding portions of community from full participation.

- **Organizational Capacity & Governance: 2.7/5.0** — Developing systems. Governance structure functional but gaps (board of 21 members with adequate diversity—38% people of color improving from 19% five years ago, fiduciary responsibility understood with finance backgrounds on board, strategic governance improving but occasional operational micromanagement, committee structure includes executive, finance, development, and nominating but no collections committee concerning for collection-focused institution, term limits of 3 three-year terms with option for 4th term if officer creating long-serving board with mixed benefits, board giving at 100% participation but wide range from $250 to $15K with median $1,200, board recruitment improving with nomination committee active and skills matrix developed, orientation occurs but ongoing education inconsistent, no board self-evaluation ever conducted missing opportunity for improvement). Staff expertise adequate but stretched (18 FTE for $1.8M budget and scope appropriate but tight, key positions filled except collections manager vacancy 9 months creating registrar overload, diversity improving with 28% staff of color versus 15% three years ago showing intentional work, professional development budget of $8K annually insufficient for 18 staff limiting conference attendance and training, salaries averaging 12% below regional museum peer group per AAM survey creating retention risk particularly for specialized roles, performance management system implemented 2019 and functional with goals and reviews, succession planning informal with knowledge loss concern if director or chief curator retired, organizational culture described as collaborative and mission-driven but strained by under-resourcing with burnout concern). Operational systems mixed (financial management system adequate with QuickBooks and monthly board reports, HR systems basic with outsourced payroll but limited HRIS functionality, collection management system using PastPerfect which is functional but limiting—migration to more robust system needed for growth, facility management reactive not preventive with deferred maintenance accumulating, project management informal without software or methodology creating coordination challenges for complex initiatives like capital campaign, communication internal weekly staff meetings and email but no intranet or collaboration platform, risk management adequate with insurance and basic policies, no business continuity plan developed creating vulnerability). Technology infrastructure dated (IT infrastructure adequate for current operations but aging, network connectivity inconsistent in older building sections, no IT staff—outsourced to local vendor with mixed results, collection database aging and limited as noted, website CMS enables basic updates but cumbersome, no CRM system—donor and member data in separate Excel files and email lists limiting relationship management for campaign, financial software adequate, no digital asset management system with photos scattered across individual computers and drives creating chaos and risk). Strategic planning approaching end of current plan (2020-2024 strategic plan comprehensive with good goals but implementation uneven due to pandemic disruption and capacity constraints, planning process in 2019 was inclusive with consultant facilitation earning buy-in, environmental scan and SWOT analysis thorough and realistic, goals are SMART in design though measurement inconsistent, resource allocation attempted though budget realities limited follow-through on some initiatives, progress monitoring quarterly by board but pandemic shifted priorities, new planning process needed for 2025-2029 with capital campaign integration essential).

**Strengths:** Board commitment growing with improving diversity and engagement, governance practices professionalizing with strategic focus, staff dedicated and capable with strong institutional knowledge and community connections, strategic planning discipline established providing framework, collaborative culture enabling integrated work despite resource constraints, mission-driven decision-making consistently referenced by staff and board.

**Critical Gaps:** Collections committee absence concerning for collection-focused institution reducing specialized governance oversight, staff compensation below market threatening retention during critical campaign period, technology infrastructure limiting efficiency and campaign management capability, no business continuity plan creating vulnerability to disruptions.

- **Financial Sustainability & Development: 2.6/5.0** — Weaknesses in sustainability. Revenue diversification concerning (earned revenue 18% of budget below 25-35% target primarily admission $98K and program fees $92K with limited facility rental and no significant shop or café revenue, individual giving 32% of budget with annual fund $285K, major gifts $185K, and planned giving only $15K annually showing need for major gift cultivation and planned giving marketing, foundation grants 24% of budget with regional foundations $275K and national grants $165K showing competitive success but concentration risk, corporate sponsorships 8% of budget $145K from 12 companies showing moderate support, government funding 11% of budget from city $125K and state $75K providing base but limited, endowment income 7% of budget with $2.3M endowment spinning off $115K at 5% showing undercapitalization, no auxiliary revenue, revenue mix concerning with top 3 sources providing 78% creating vulnerability). Fundraising capability limited (development staff of 1.5 FTE—director and half-time development coordinator insufficient for campaign creating urgent need for campaign director hire, board involvement improving with development committee active but only 40% of board makes introductions or cultivates prospects showing need for training and accountability, donor pipeline shallow with 47 prospects at major gift level $10K+ but limited $25K+ prospects for campaign leadership gifts, case for support articulated but not compelling with limited impact measurement weakening argument, donor stewardship basic with thank you letters and newsletter but no strategic engagement plans for top donors, fundraising events minimal with annual benefit generating $45K net and member preview events cultivating but not asking, grant writing strong with skilled staff securing competitive grants showing capability, planned giving program nascent with no marketing and estate gifts accidental not cultivated). Endowment health weak (endowment of $2.3M equals 1.3× operating budget far below 3-5× target providing minimal stability, spending rate at 5% appropriate, investment returns averaging 6.8% over 10 years adequate relative to balanced portfolio target, no quasi-endowment with board reluctant to designate reserves reducing flexibility, true endowment $1.8M with $500K board-designated, planned giving pipeline minimal with only 8 documented estate intent totaling estimated $840K, endowment growth strategy through campaign appropriate targeting $3.7M addition to reach $6M total improving but not solving capitalization). Cost management adequate (budget process inclusive with department input and board approval, expense monitoring monthly with few variances showing discipline, cost containment through salary freezes during pandemic and reduced hours creating burnout risk not sustainable long-term, limited shared services exploration with neighboring arts organizations showing opportunity, facility efficiency poor due to aging systems increasing costs $40-50K annually versus modern building, technology investments deferred due to budget constraints, procurement competitive, benchmarking shows salaries 12% below peers, operating costs 8% below peers, and program spending 52% of budget below 60% target indicating underfunding of mission).

**Strengths:** Grant writing strength securing competitive foundation support showing institutional credibility, budget discipline with consistent balanced budgets demonstrating financial management competency, board fiscal oversight strong with finance committee engaged and informed, cost consciousness preventing waste while supporting mission, campaign goal realistic relative to donor base and needs if aggressively executed.

**Critical Gaps:** Revenue concentration risk with top sources providing 78% creating vulnerability if any source decreases, major gift pipeline shallow for $8M campaign creating urgency for prospect identification and cultivation, development staffing grossly inadequate for campaign requiring immediate campaign director hire and possibly additional gift officer, endowment undercapitalization providing minimal income cushion and requiring campaign emphasis on endowment not just capital, planned giving program underdeveloped missing intergenerational wealth transfer opportunity.

- **Community Impact & Relevance: 3.2/5.0** — Emerging strength. Cultural relevance improving (programming increasingly addresses current issues with 2023 exhibition on regional racial history during civil rights era attracting 8,500 visitors and generating community conversation showing willingness to tackle difficult subjects, diverse cultural representation growing with indigenous programming expanded and Latino heritage programming launched showing responsiveness, contemporary relevance through regional artist exhibitions connecting historical collections to present, timely programming responding to anniversaries and current events with agility, community voice in content development growing through advisory groups for indigenous and African American history exhibitions, youth engagement programs including teen advisory board of 12 members piloted 2022 showing investment in next generation, experimentation encouraged with staff empowered to pilot programs and learn from failures, relevance evaluation through community conversations and surveys showing 73% of community aware of museum up from 58% in 2018). Social equity commitment growing (DEAI strategic plan developed 2021 with specific goals for staff diversity, community representation, accessibility, and economic access showing intentionality, staff diversity 28% people of color improving steadily, board diversity 38% people of color and 52% women showing progress, pay equity analysis conducted 2020 revealing no significant gaps, accessible pricing with $5 admission, free admission first Sunday monthly, free for members, and $2 for students/seniors making affordable, free community days quarterly eliminating cost barrier for those months, transportation barriers being addressed through free shuttle pilot from transit center showing responsiveness, community employment providing 18 FTE with hiring preference for local residents, procurement equity tracked with 18% minority-owned vendors improving from 9% three years ago). Partnership ecosystem moderate (12 school districts with formal agreements creating education pipeline, community organization partnerships with 8 local cultural organizations, libraries, and social service agencies extending reach, university collaboration with regional public university on research projects and student internships providing mutual benefit, corporate partnerships primarily sponsorship not deeper engagement, government partnerships through city and county support and coordination, no international partnerships, grassroots partnerships growing with neighborhood associations on outreach programs). Educational contribution strong (K-12 education serving 12,000 students annually with curriculum-aligned programs contributing to educational ecosystem, adult education modest through lectures and programs, teacher professional development through summer institute for 20 teachers annually building capacity, lifelong learning through diverse programs, community education responsive to needs identified through surveys, research support for university and independent scholars, public programs providing cultural enrichment accessible at low or no cost). Public value demonstration developing (impact measurement through visitor surveys and program evaluations but lacking comprehensive outcome data, transformation stories collected informally but not systematically reducing evidence base, economic impact study from 2018 showed $2.8M regional economic impact through spending and jobs, social impact evidence anecdotal through testimonials but not rigorously measured, educational outcomes measured through pre-post tests showing learning gains but sample sizes small, cultural preservation outcomes clear through collection care and interpretation but not quantified, ROI calculation showing $3.50 community value per $1 of public funding but methodology basic, public awareness growing with 73% name recognition).

**Strengths:** Cultural relevance intentionally cultivated with responsive programming earning community trust, equity commitment authentic with concrete actions and investments beyond rhetoric, educational contribution robust and valued by schools creating strong community relationship and rationale for support, partnership ecosystem providing reach multiplier and community integration, public value growing recognition though requiring better documentation.

**Moderate Gap:** Public value demonstration underdeveloped with limited outcome measurement reducing campaign case strength—opportunity to invest in evaluation and storytelling documenting impact more rigorously and compellingly.

**Critical Observations & Campaign Readiness:**

1. **Campaign Feasibility Assessment: CONDITIONAL GREEN LIGHT** — Campaign viable but requiring 12-18 month preparatory phase addressing critical gaps before public launch. Institution has mission credibility, community goodwill, and legitimate capital needs, but development infrastructure inadequate for $8M campaign, and collection care crisis must be addressed to maintain donor confidence.

2. **Development Infrastructure Crisis** (Impact: CRITICAL) — 1.5 FTE development staff cannot execute $8M campaign. **Action Required:** Immediate hire of campaign director at $85-95K plus benefits ($110-120K total) with campaign management experience, major gift cultivation skills, and 3-5 year commitment. Consider campaign consultant at $3-5K monthly for 24 months providing strategy, board training, and accountability ($72-120K total). Hire additional gift officer if campaign director assessment confirms need after 6 months ($60-70K range). Development infrastructure investment of $230-280K over campaign period essential, amortized across campaign overhead budget typically 8-12% of goal.

3. **Collection Care Crisis Threatening Credibility** (Impact: HIGH) — Campaign including collection storage and environmental control upgrade wise, but current collection care deficiencies risk donor confidence if visible. **Action Required:** Emergency collection care investments before campaign launch—environmental monitoring system $35K, pest management program $8K annually, fire suppression completion $120K, conservation triage on highest risk objects $40K, cataloging sprint completing remaining 28% $45K, provenance research on concerning objects $25K, NAGPRA consultation resumption and completion $30K ($303K total over 18 months). Frame to donors as "pre-campaign investments demonstrating seriousness" and include in quiet phase cultivation conversations showing problem awareness and action. Consider collections assessment by independent consultant ($15-25K) generating credible third-party validation of needs for case for support.

4. **Board Campaign Readiness Gaps** (Impact: HIGH) — Only 40% of board actively cultivating donors insufficient for campaign. **Action Required:** Board development intensive including campaign expectations workshop, moves management training, individual gift goal-setting with each board member ($10K minimum, $25K stretch for campaign period), prospect identification exercises generating lists from each board member's networks, accountability structure with monthly reporting to development committee, recognition for board giving and cultivation activity. Consider adding 3-5 campaign-focused board members with wealth capacity and networks during quiet phase. Board campaign giving target: $1.6-2.0M (20-25% of goal) requiring lead gifts from board members demonstrating commitment before asking community.

5. **Major Gift Pipeline Shallow for Goal** (Impact: HIGH) — 47 prospects at $10K+ level insufficient for $8M campaign requiring 8-12 gifts at $100K+, 15-20 at $50K+, and 30-40 at $25K+. **Action Required:** Aggressive prospect research and identification—wealth screening of donor database $8-12K identifying capacity, board and staff networking generating introductions, corporate campaign targeting 15-20 companies for $50-150K gifts, foundation portfolio building with 8-10 major local/regional foundations at $100-250K. Quiet phase of 12-18 months securing $4-5M (50-62% of goal) in leadership commitments before public launch essential. Campaign timeline: 18-month quiet phase, 6-month public phase, 12-month completion phase (36 months total with 18 months preparatory).

6. **Case for Support Needs Impact Evidence** (Impact: MEDIUM) — Campaign materials require compelling impact data and stories documenting community value. **Action Required:** Impact documentation project—commission economic impact study update $25K, conduct outcome evaluation of educational programs with longitudinal data $15K, develop 15-20 transformation stories through professional interviewing and writing $8K, create data visualization of community reach and engagement $5K, video testimonials from educators, students, and community members $15K (total $68K). Integrate into case for support showing problem, solution, and impact with emotional resonance and quantitative credibility.
