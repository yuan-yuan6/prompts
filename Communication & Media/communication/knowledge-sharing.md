# Knowledge Sharing & Expertise Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for facilitating organizational learning, distributing best practices, capturing lessons learned, sharing expertise effectively, and building institutional knowledge that drives continuous improvement and innovation.

## Quick Knowledge Sharing Prompt

Create a knowledge sharing program for [organization/team] of [size] people. Identify subject matter experts in [domain areas], establish sharing formats including [session types], implement after-action review process for [project types], create expert directory on [platform], and design recognition program for [knowledge contribution]. Target [participation rate] with monthly [cadence] and capture lessons learned in [repository system].

## Quick Start

Create a knowledge sharing culture in 3 practical steps:

1. **Identify Your Experts** - Map out who knows what in your organization. Create a simple expert directory with names, areas of expertise, and contact information. Make it searchable and accessible (shared spreadsheet, intranet page, or collaboration tool profile). Update quarterly and encourage self-nomination.

2. **Launch "Lunch & Learn" Sessions** - Schedule monthly 30-45 minute sessions where team members share expertise, project learnings, or industry insights. Keep it informal and interactive. Record sessions for those who can't attend live. Create a simple template: Topic overview (5 min) → Key learnings (15 min) → Q&A (15 min) → Resources/next steps (5 min).

3. **Implement After-Action Reviews** - After completing any project or major milestone, hold a 30-minute retrospective with the team. Ask four questions: What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Why were there differences? What can we learn? Document insights in a shared location and share with relevant teams.

**Pro Tip**: Start small with one knowledge sharing mechanism rather than trying to implement everything at once. A successful lunch & learn series will naturally lead to requests for documentation, expert directories, and communities of practice. Build momentum with quick wins.
