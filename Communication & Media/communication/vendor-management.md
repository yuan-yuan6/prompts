# Vendor Management & Procurement Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage **vendor relationships and procurement** strategically—optimizing value, mitigating risk, and ensuring performance at scale. Use this to diagnose capability gaps and build a roadmap for operational excellence.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **vendor management readiness** for {VENDOR_PORTFOLIO}. The procurement objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a vendor management & procurement readiness assessment for {VENDOR_PORTFOLIO}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Provide evidence-based findings and actionable recommendations.

**1) VENDOR SEGMENTATION & STRATEGY**
- Vendors are segmented by criticality, spend, and strategic value
- Sourcing strategy exists per category (single vs. multi-source, TCO-based)
- Vendor selection criteria are clear and consistently applied
- Portfolio is balanced for risk, innovation access, and cost optimization

**2) CONTRACT & RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT**
- Contracts are clear on scope, pricing, SLAs, termination, and risk allocation
- Renewal pipeline and negotiation strategy are proactive and data-driven
- Governance structure defines decision rights, cadence, and escalation paths
- Strategic vendors have engagement models that foster partnership and co-innovation

**3) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY**
- KPIs are defined per vendor and tied to business outcomes
- Scorecards track quality, delivery, cost, responsiveness, and compliance
- Performance reviews happen on schedule with documented action plans
- Recognition and consequences exist for high/low performers

**4) RISK, COMPLIANCE & CONTINUITY**
- Vendor risk is assessed (financial, operational, cyber, ESG, concentration)
- Critical vendors have business continuity and disaster recovery plans
- Compliance and audit requirements are tracked and enforced
- Incident response and escalation protocols are tested and documented

**5) OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY & SYSTEMS**
- Procurement processes are standardized and automated where appropriate
- Purchase-to-pay workflows minimize cycle time and approval friction
- Spend analytics and reporting provide visibility by category, vendor, and trend
- Vendor portals or systems enable self-service and transparency

**6) CAPABILITY & VENDOR DEVELOPMENT**
- Procurement team has skills in negotiation, category management, and risk
- Vendor training and onboarding programs exist for complex engagements
- Collaboration forums drive innovation and continuous improvement
- Vendor exit and transition processes minimize disruption

---

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, top procurement risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **VENDOR PORTFOLIO MATRIX**
- Segment vendors by criticality and performance (strategic/preferred/transactional/at-risk)
- Highlight biggest dependencies and gaps

4) **PERFORMANCE & RISK DASHBOARD**
- Top 5 vendors: performance score, SLA compliance, open issues, renewal dates
- Top risks: vendor concentration, compliance gaps, or continuity threats

5) **IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP**
- Prioritized actions to close gaps in segmentation, measurement, risk, and efficiency
- Owners, dependencies, and success metrics

6) **30/60/90-DAY ACTION PLAN**
- Quick wins (scorecards, escalation paths) and foundational changes (contracts, systems)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, inconsistent, minimal oversight)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic processes exist, significant gaps in measurement and risk)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, scaling challenges and inconsistent execution)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (measured, proactive, continuous optimization)
- 5.0: Optimized (strategic value realization, high trust, innovation partnership)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {VENDOR_PORTFOLIO}: Vendor count, spend, categories, and critical dependencies
- {OBJECTIVES}: Cost savings, quality, risk mitigation, sustainability, innovation goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Budget, systems, team capacity, compliance requirements, timeline

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {VENDOR_PORTFOLIO}: 120 vendors, $45M annual spend across IT (40%), professional services (30%), facilities (20%), other (10%). Top 3 vendors = 55% of spend. Mission-critical: cloud infrastructure (AWS), payroll (ADP), ERP (SAP).
- {OBJECTIVES}: Reduce spend by 12% over 12 months, achieve 95% SLA compliance, eliminate 3 single-source dependencies, establish ESG compliance reporting for top 20 vendors.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Procurement team of 4; contract repository is decentralized; vendor performance data is manual; 18-month ERP migration underway.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.5 (Developing)
- Top risks: vendor concentration (55% in top 3), no BCP for AWS/ADP, manual SLA tracking
- Key improvements: (1) implement vendor segmentation and scorecards, (2) formalize governance and escalation, (3) automate spend analytics

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Vendor Segmentation & Strategy: 2/5 — segmentation exists informally; TCO analysis missing
- Contract & Relationship Management: 3/5 — contracts exist; renewals are reactive
- Performance Measurement: 2/5 — KPIs defined for 30% of vendors; no scorecards
- Risk, Compliance & Continuity: 2/5 — risk register incomplete; no BCP validation
- Operational Efficiency: 2/5 — manual approval workflows; no spend dashboard
- Capability & Development: 3/5 — team skilled; no vendor training program

**3) VENDOR PORTFOLIO MATRIX**
- Strategic (5 vendors, 60% spend): AWS, ADP, SAP, legal counsel, security vendor
- Preferred (15 vendors, 25% spend): consultancies, staffing agencies, SaaS tools
- Transactional (80 vendors, 12% spend): office supplies, travel, small services
- At-risk (20 vendors, 3% spend): poor performance or low engagement
- Biggest dependencies: AWS (no backup plan), ADP (payroll single-source)

**4) PERFORMANCE & RISK DASHBOARD**
- AWS: 4.2/5 performance, 98% SLA, issue: no BCP testing, renewal in 6 months
- ADP: 3.8/5, 92% SLA, issue: payroll error rate rising, renewal in 3 months
- SAP: 3.5/5, 88% SLA, issue: support responsiveness declining, renewal in 9 months
- Top risks: vendor concentration (55% in top 3), single-source payroll, no cyber audit for 40% of IT vendors

**5) IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP**
- Q1: implement vendor segmentation + scorecard framework (owner: procurement lead)
- Q2: establish quarterly business reviews for strategic vendors (owner: category managers)
- Q3: automate spend analytics dashboard + contract repository (owner: IT + procurement)
- Q4: validate BCP for AWS/ADP; identify backup vendors for payroll (owner: risk manager)
- Success metrics: scorecard coverage 80%+, spend visibility real-time, SLA compliance 95%+

**6) 30/60/90-DAY ACTION PLAN**
- 30 days: define vendor segmentation criteria + identify strategic/preferred/transactional
- 60 days: deploy scorecard for top 10 vendors; document escalation paths
- 90 days: centralize contract repository; run BCP tabletop for AWS/ADP
- Metrics: segmentation complete, scorecard adoption, contract centralization %

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Segment vendors by criticality and spend; tailor governance and KPIs accordingly.
2) Define SLAs explicitly in contracts with measurement, reporting, and consequences.
3) Track performance with scorecards reviewed quarterly for strategic vendors.
4) Assess and mitigate concentration risk; maintain backup options for critical services.
5) Validate business continuity plans annually with tabletop exercises.
6) Automate spend analytics and contract lifecycle tracking to reduce manual overhead.
7) Build strategic partnerships through joint innovation forums and value-sharing.
8) Establish exit and transition playbooks to minimize disruption when switching vendors.
