# AI Data Strategy and Management

## Purpose
Design and implement comprehensive data strategies that support AI/ML initiatives. This framework covers data collection, quality management, feature engineering infrastructure, and governance practices essential for building reliable AI systems.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
```
AI DATA STRATEGY FOR: E-commerce Recommendation System

1. DATA SOURCES
   - User behavior: Clickstream, purchases, searches (real-time)
   - Product catalog: Descriptions, categories, images (batch daily)
   - Customer profiles: Demographics, preferences (batch weekly)
   Volume: 50M events/day, 2M products, 5M customers

2. DATA QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
   - Completeness: >95% for required fields
   - Freshness: Behavior data <5 min latency
   - Accuracy: Product prices 100% match source

3. FEATURE STORE DESIGN
   - Online features: User last-N interactions (Redis, <10ms)
   - Offline features: User lifetime value, product popularity (Spark)
   - Feature refresh: Online=real-time, Offline=daily

4. DATA GOVERNANCE
   - PII handling: User IDs pseudonymized, no raw emails in ML
   - Retention: 2 years behavioral, 7 years transactional
   - Access: ML team read-only, Data Eng write access
```

### When to Use This
- Starting a new AI/ML project and need to plan data infrastructure
- Scaling from prototype to production AI systems
- Addressing data quality issues affecting model performance
- Building shared data assets across multiple ML use cases
- Establishing data governance for AI compliance

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Inventory** - Catalog available data sources and assess quality
2. **Design** - Architecture data pipelines and storage for ML needs
3. **Implement** - Build feature stores, pipelines, and quality checks
4. **Govern** - Establish access controls, lineage, and documentation
5. **Monitor** - Track data quality metrics and pipeline health

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Business Outcomes** - Define data requirements from ML objectives, not available data. Identify what predictions you need before cataloging data sources.

2. **Design for Reusability** - Build feature stores and pipelines that serve multiple models. Shared infrastructure reduces duplication and improves consistency.

3. **Automate Quality Checks** - Implement data validation at every pipeline stage. Catch quality issues before they reach model training.

4. **Version Everything** - Track data versions alongside model versions. Enable reproducibility and debugging by maintaining complete lineage.

5. **Plan for Scale** - Design architecture for 10x current volume. Avoid rearchitecting when data growth outpaces infrastructure.

6. **Document Obsessively** - Maintain data dictionaries, feature definitions, and pipeline documentation. Future you will thank present you.

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Training-Serving Skew** - Features computed differently in training vs. serving
✅ Instead: Use feature store to ensure identical computation in both contexts

❌ **Data Leakage** - Using future information in training features
✅ Instead: Implement point-in-time correct feature retrieval

❌ **Undocumented Transformations** - Logic buried in notebooks
✅ Instead: Codify all transformations in version-controlled pipelines

❌ **Ignoring Data Drift** - Assuming data distributions stay constant
✅ Instead: Monitor feature distributions and alert on significant drift

❌ **Over-Engineering Early** - Building complex infrastructure before validating ML value
✅ Instead: Start simple, iterate based on proven model value

❌ **Siloed Feature Development** - Each team building duplicate features
✅ Instead: Establish central feature store with discovery and sharing
