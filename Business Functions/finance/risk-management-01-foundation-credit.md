# Risk Management Readiness Assessment — Foundation & Credit Risk

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to run core risk governance and credit risk management with clear decision rights, consistent policies, reliable measurement, and repeatable review cadence.

## Quick Prompt
Assess readiness for [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME] to implement ERM foundation and credit risk management. Evaluate governance and risk appetite, credit policy and underwriting, portfolio monitoring and early warning, credit loss measurement and stress testing, data and systems, and culture/accountability. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Governance, Decision Rights & Risk Appetite
- 1: Governance is informal; risk appetite is not operationalized.
- 3: Appetite exists; limits and escalation are partially defined.
- 5: Appetite, limits, escalation, and board oversight are consistent and enforced.

2) Credit Policy, Underwriting & Approval Controls
- 1: Underwriting varies by team; documentation is inconsistent.
- 3: Policy exists; exceptions are managed but uneven.
- 5: Standards, exception governance, and approvals are consistent and auditable.

3) Portfolio Monitoring, Concentrations & Early Warning
- 1: Monitoring is reactive; concentrations are discovered late.
- 3: Periodic monitoring; early warning indicators exist for key segments.
- 5: Standard dashboards, concentration controls, and watchlist governance.

4) Credit Loss Measurement & Stress Testing
- 1: Loss expectations are qualitative; stress testing is sporadic.
- 3: Basic stress tests and provisioning logic exist.
- 5: Documented methodology, scenario design, and decision-linked outputs.

5) Data, Systems & Reporting Reliability
- 1: Data is fragmented; reporting is manual and inconsistent.
- 3: Core systems feed reports; reconciliation is periodic.
- 5: Traceable lineage, reconciliations, and consistent definitions are standard.

6) Risk Culture, Accountability & Three Lines
- 1: Risk ownership is unclear; escalation is inconsistent.
- 3: Roles exist; training and accountability are partial.
- 5: Clear ownership, incentives, training, and escalation norms across lines.

## Deliverables
- Risk governance map (committees, charters, decision rights, escalation)
- Risk appetite statement with operational limits and triggers
- Credit policy and underwriting standards with exception framework
- Portfolio monitoring pack (concentrations, watchlist, KRIs)
- Stress test summary and management action triggers

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent governance and credit decisions.
- Level 2: Documented — policies exist; enforcement varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — monitoring and approvals are standard for most cycles.
- Level 4: Managed — stress testing, triggers, and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — outcomes feedback improves underwriting and limits.

## Variables
- [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME]
- [INSTITUTION_TYPE]
- [TOTAL_ASSETS]
- [PORTFOLIO_SEGMENTS]
- [RISK_APPETITE_LIMITS]
- [CONCENTRATION_LIMITS]
- [EARLY_WARNING_INDICATORS]
- [STRESS_SCENARIOS]

## Example (Condensed)
Community bank with CRE concentration.
- Appetite: single-borrower and CRE limits with escalation triggers.
- Underwriting: standardized cash flow, collateral, and covenant requirements.
- Monitoring: watchlist governance and quarterly concentration review.
- Stress: downside CRE price shock with management actions tied to triggers.
