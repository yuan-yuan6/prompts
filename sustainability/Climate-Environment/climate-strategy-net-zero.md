# Climate Strategy & Net Zero Planning Template

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive climate strategy with science-based emissions reduction targets, credible net zero transition plan, decarbonization roadmap across Scope 1, 2, and 3, alignment with Paris Agreement 1.5°C pathway, and transparent carbon management approach.

## Quick Start

**Need climate strategy quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Mid-size manufacturing company
Climate Commitment: Net zero by 2050, science-based targets (SBTi approved)
Baseline (2022): 85,000 tCO2e total (Scope 1: 30K, Scope 2: 15K, Scope 3: 40K)

Targets:
- 2030: 50% reduction absolute (Scope 1+2), 30% reduction Scope 3 (vs 2022)
- 2040: 90% reduction (Scope 1+2+3)
- 2050: Net zero (residual <5%, high-quality removals)

Decarbonization Levers:
1. Energy efficiency: -20% energy use by 2028 ($30M investment, $4M/year savings)
2. Renewable electricity: 100% by 2027 ($15M PPAs, rooftop solar)
3. Electrification: Replace gas boilers, forklifts by 2032 ($25M)
4. Sustainable materials: 50% lower-carbon inputs by 2035 (supplier engagement)
5. Carbon removals: 2,500 tCO2e/year from 2045 (nature-based + DACCS)

Investment: $120M over 15 years; ROI positive with carbon pricing avoided
```

### When to Use This
- Setting first climate strategy or refreshing existing commitments
- Preparing science-based targets (SBTi) submission
- Responding to investor/customer net zero requirements
- Aligning with Paris Agreement and 1.5°C pathway
- Preparing TCFD climate disclosure

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Carbon Footprint Baseline** - Measure Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions (4-6 weeks)
2. **Target Setting** - Set science-based near and long-term targets (2-3 weeks)
3. **Abatement Analysis** - Identify decarbonization levers and costs (4-6 weeks)
4. **Transition Plan** - Build detailed roadmap with initiatives (4-6 weeks)
5. **Governance & Reporting** - Establish tracking, disclosure, accountability (2-3 weeks)

```
Company: Automotive parts ($2B revenue, 85,000 tCO2e: Scope 1 35%, Scope 2 18%, Scope 3 47%)
Commitment: Net zero 2050, SBTi 1.5°C approved (2030: -50% Scope 1+2, -30% Scope 3)

- 2030: 50% total reduction via efficiency, solar, supplier engagement
- 2035: Electrification (boilers, forklifts, fleet) - 25K tCO2e
- 2040: Green hydrogen, circular materials - 85% reduction
- 2050: <4K tCO2e residual + 4K tCO2e removals = Net Zero
Investment: $120M (positive NPV with carbon pricing scenario)
```

### Example 2: Technology Company Climate Strategy

- 2030: Cloud providers 50% reduction (AWS, Azure partnerships)
- 2035: Sustainable software practices, customer data center efficiency
- 2040: 90% Scope 3 reduction + 5K tCO2e removals = Net Zero
Investment: $25M (mainly cloud decarbonization, employee programs)
Focus: Scope 3 Category 1 (cloud) partnerships, Category 6 (travel reduction)
```

### Example 3: Retail Company Climate Strategy
```
Company: Omnichannel retailer ($4B revenue, 550,000 tCO2e: 15% stores/logistics, 85% products Scope 3)
Commitment: Net zero 2050, SBTi 1.5°C targets

- 2050: <30K tCO2e residual + removals = Net Zero
Investment: $200M over 25 years
Key: Product decarbonization (work with brands), last-mile delivery EVs
```

## Best Practices

### Target Setting
1. **Science-based** - Align with SBTi, not arbitrary
2. **Absolute + intensity** - Both matter; absolute is primary
3. **Include Scope 3** - Often 80%+ of footprint
4. **Interim milestones** - 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2050
5. **Net zero = 90%+ reduction** - Not offsets for current emissions

### Decarbonization
1. **Abatement curve** - Prioritize lowest cost per tonne first
2. **Quick wins** - Build momentum with efficiency, renewables
3. **Deep cuts** - Don't stop at easy 20%, plan for 90%+
4. **Value chain critical** - Engage suppliers early
5. **Removals last** - Only for hard-to-abate residual (<10%)

### Transition Plan
1. **Credible pathway** - Specific initiatives, not aspirations
2. **Resourced** - Budget allocated for decarbonization
3. **Accountable** - Owners for each lever, executive KPIs
4. **Transparent** - Annual reporting on progress
5. **Adaptive** - Revise as technology improves

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Offsetting instead of reducing** - Buying offsets without deep decarbonization
✅ Instead: 90%+ absolute reduction, then removals for residual

❌ **Scope 3 avoidance** - Only addressing direct emissions (Scope 1+2)
✅ Instead: Comprehensive strategy for all scopes including Scope 3

❌ **Vague commitments** - "Carbon neutral" without defining scope or pathway
✅ Instead: Specific targets, transparent methodology, clear roadmap

❌ **Unrealistic timeline** - Net zero next year without credible plan
✅ Instead: Ambitious but achievable targets (2040-2050 typical for net zero)

❌ **Technology wishful thinking** - Assuming future tech will solve it
✅ Instead: Plan with available technology, adapt as new solutions emerge
