## Best Practices

1. **Define clear research objectives** - Know what questions you need to answer
2. **Use mixed methods** - Combine qualitative and quantitative approaches
3. **Recruit representative participants** - Ensure diversity in your research sample
4. **Remain objective and unbiased** - Avoid leading questions and confirmation bias
5. **Document everything** - Record sessions, take detailed notes, save artifacts
6. **Involve stakeholders early** - Share findings and insights regularly
7. **Validate assumptions** - Test hypotheses with real users
8. **Look for patterns** - Synthesize data to identify themes and trends
9. **Make findings actionable** - Translate insights into design recommendations
10. **Iterate and refine** - Research is ongoing, not one-time activity

## Tips for Success

- Schedule buffer time for participant recruitment and rescheduling
- Test your research materials with a pilot participant first
- Record sessions (with permission) for detailed analysis later
- Use collaborative synthesis workshops to build team alignment
- Create visual artifacts like personas and journey maps for stakeholder communication
- Build a research repository for ongoing reference and learning
- Balance depth and breadth based on project constraints
- Consider remote research methods for broader participant reach
- Compensate participants appropriately for their time
- Follow ethical research practices and obtain proper consent
