# Curriculum Development Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to create or redesign a curriculum (program, course sequence, training plan) and turn it into an actionable build-and-launch plan.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess curriculum-development readiness for **{CURRICULUM_SCOPE}** for **{LEARNER_AUDIENCE}** with constraints **{CONSTRAINTS}**.
>
> Score readiness 1–5 across six dimensions. Provide a maturity scorecard, gap analysis, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day plan.

---

## Readiness Dimensions (Score 1–5)

### 1) Scope & Stakeholder Readiness
- Clear scope boundaries (what’s in/out)
- Stakeholders identified and aligned (sponsor, faculty/SMEs, ops)
- Decision rights and approval process defined

### 2) Learner Needs & Context Readiness
- Learner baseline and needs known (skills, accessibility, motivations)
- Learning environment understood (workplace, school, remote/hybrid)
- Constraints documented (time, budget, tools, compliance)

### 3) Outcomes & Competency Readiness
- Competencies/outcomes defined and measurable
- Alignment to standards or role requirements (if applicable)
- Progression levels defined (beginner → proficient → advanced)

### 4) Content & Pathway Readiness
- Module map and sequencing (prereqs, progression)
- Content sources and effort plan (build vs buy vs curate)
- Practical work integrated (projects, labs, practice tasks)

### 5) Assessment & Quality Readiness
- Assessment plan mapped to outcomes (formative + summative)
- Rubrics and grading criteria defined
- Quality controls (review, updates, consistency) planned

### 6) Launch & Operations Readiness
- Delivery plan (cadence, facilitation, LMS/tooling)
- Learner support plan (office hours, feedback timelines, accommodations)
- Measurement plan (completion, satisfaction, mastery, outcomes)

## Required Output Format

1) **Executive Summary**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Current maturity level (1–5)
- Top 3 recommendations

2) **Dimension Scorecard**
- Table: Dimension | Score (1–5) | Evidence | Gap

3) **Curriculum Blueprint**
- Competencies/outcomes (5–12)
- Pathway structure (phases/modules)
- Assessment methods and evidence artifacts

4) **Gap Analysis (Top 5)**
- Ranked by impact × urgency

5) **90-Day Plan**
- Weeks 1–4: define outcomes + module outline + assessment blueprint
- Weeks 5–8: build/curate content + create 1 pilot module
- Weeks 9–12: pilot + iterate + finalize launch package

6) **Success Metrics**
- Baseline → 30/60/90-day targets

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Ad hoc:** Informal content; unclear outcomes; inconsistent delivery.
- **2 — Emerging:** Some structure; gaps in measurement and sequencing.
- **3 — Defined:** Outcomes, sequence, and assessments are coherent.
- **4 — Managed:** Delivery is consistent; metrics drive iteration.
- **5 — Optimized:** Highly repeatable; strong transfer to real performance.

## Variables

| Variable | What to provide | Example |
|---|---|---|
| {CURRICULUM_SCOPE} | What you’re building | "Onboarding curriculum for junior analysts" |
| {LEARNER_AUDIENCE} | Who it’s for | "New hires with mixed experience" |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Time/budget/tools constraints | "6 weeks; 3 hrs/week; LMS required" |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {CURRICULUM_SCOPE}: "8-week onboarding curriculum for junior analysts"
- {LEARNER_AUDIENCE}: "New hires; mixed Excel skill; no SQL"
- {CONSTRAINTS}: "3 hrs/week; async-first; must include accessibility accommodations"

**Output (abridged)**
- Overall readiness: 3.1/5 (Defined)
- Top recommendations: narrow tool scope; add rubric-based milestones; pilot one module early

Scorecard highlights
- Scope & Stakeholder: 3 — Sponsor exists; SME time not committed
- Learner Needs: 4 — Baseline and constraints are clear
- Outcomes & Competencies: 3 — Outcomes drafted; need measurable artifacts
- Content & Pathway: 3 — Module list exists; prerequisites need refinement
- Assessment & Quality: 2 — Rubrics missing; review cycle unclear
- Launch & Operations: 4 — Delivery plan exists; support timelines need definition

## Best Practices (8)
1. Write outcomes as observable behaviors and artifacts.
2. Keep the pathway short and sequenced; avoid “everything at once.”
3. Map every assessment to an outcome.
4. Use rubrics to standardize evaluation and feedback.
5. Favor practice and projects over passive content.
6. Pilot early with a small cohort and iterate quickly.
7. Design for accessibility from the start.
8. Track a few metrics consistently and use them to improve.
