# Ad Copy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready a team is to create effective ad copy that matches the offer, fits channel constraints, and supports measurable testing and iteration.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess ad copy readiness for [BRAND_NAME] promoting [OFFER] to [TARGET_AUDIENCE] on [PRIMARY_PLATFORM] with objective [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Offer & positioning, (2) Audience & insights, (3) Message architecture & creative system, (4) Channel fit & format constraints, (5) Production workflow & quality, (6) Measurement, testing & compliance. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 30-day improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Offer & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: The offer is unclear or generic; ads rely on vague claims; differentiation is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Clear offer, audience promise, and proof points; messaging ties to a single positioning statement.
- 5 — Optimized: Offers are intentionally designed and segmented; proof is strong; messaging is consistent across funnel and channels.

### 2) Audience & Insights
- 1 — Initial: Audience is broad; pain points and objections are assumptions; limited clarity on intent.
- 3 — Defined: Primary personas and key objections are documented; message angles map to motivations.
- 5 — Optimized: Insights are continuously refreshed (research + performance); segmentation and creative personalization are repeatable.

### 3) Message Architecture & Creative System
- 1 — Initial: One-off headlines and CTAs; weak consistency; little reuse of proven patterns.
- 3 — Defined: Message pillars, angle library, and CTA conventions; variants generated systematically.
- 5 — Optimized: A governed creative system (angles → claims → proof → CTAs) enables fast iteration without brand drift.

### 4) Channel Fit & Format Constraints
- 1 — Initial: Copy ignores character limits and placements; creative is not adapted by channel.
- 3 — Defined: Channel-specific templates exist; copy respects constraints and matches platform intent.
- 5 — Optimized: Intent, placements, and creative formats are matched to funnel stage; adaptations are automated and quality-checked.

### 5) Production Workflow & Quality
- 1 — Initial: Ad creation is ad-hoc; reviews are inconsistent; errors ship; ownership unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Brief → draft → review → approval workflow; QA checklist; versioning for variants.
- 5 — Optimized: High-throughput production with clear SLAs; reusable components; minimal rework via strong briefs and feedback loops.

### 6) Measurement, Testing & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Little testing; unclear KPIs; tracking gaps; compliance checked late.
- 3 — Defined: A/B testing routine; KPI definitions; tracking is verified; policy/compliance checklist exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program with learnings repository; statistically sound testing; compliance and claim substantiation are built-in.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence notes and top gaps
- Offer statement, message pillars, and proof points library
- Channel copy templates (limits, placements, and intent notes)
- Test plan (hypotheses, variants, success metrics)
- QA and compliance checklist (claims, disclosures, approvals)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand or product name
- [OFFER]: Offer (trial, demo, discount, bundle, consultation)
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE]: Primary persona/segment
- [PRIMARY_PLATFORM]: Primary channel (Search, Meta, LinkedIn, Display, etc.)
- [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE]: Awareness, traffic, lead, or purchase objective
- [PROOF_ELEMENT]: Testimonial, metric, case study, certification, or guarantee

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: B2B workflow tool
- Channel/objective: LinkedIn lead gen → demo requests
- Scores (1–5): Offer 3; Audience 2; Message System 2; Channel Fit 3; Workflow 3; Testing/Compliance 2
- Top gaps: Weak persona objections map; limited angle library; inconsistent learnings capture
- 30-day priorities: Define top personas + objections; build an angle library; set a weekly testing cadence with tracking QA
