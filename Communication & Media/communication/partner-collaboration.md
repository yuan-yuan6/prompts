## Purpose
Assess readiness to build **successful strategic partnerships** that drive mutual value, innovation, and market expansion. Use this to diagnose gaps in partner strategy, enablement, governance, and performance management.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **partner collaboration readiness** for {PARTNER_CONTEXT}. The partnership objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a partner collaboration & strategic alliances readiness assessment for {PARTNER_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (partner satisfaction, revenue/pipeline, engagement quality, issue resolution).

**1) PARTNER STRATEGY & VALUE PROPOSITION**
- Partner types and tiers are defined (strategic, channel, tech, referral)
- Mutual value proposition is clear and validated with partners
- Ideal partner profile and selection criteria exist
- Portfolio is balanced for strategic fit, market coverage, and risk

**2) ONBOARDING & ENABLEMENT**
- Onboarding plans set clear expectations, milestones, and success criteria
- Training covers product, positioning, sales process, and support
- Resources are accessible (portal, docs, tools, contacts)
- Time-to-first-deal and partner ramp metrics are tracked

**3) GOVERNANCE & COMMUNICATION**
- Governance structure defines roles, decision rights, and escalation paths
- Regular cadence exists (QBRs, ops syncs, executive reviews)
- Communication is proactive and transparent (roadmaps, changes, wins)
- Conflict resolution process is documented and followed

**4) GO-TO-MARKET & CO-SELLING**
- Joint go-to-market plan exists with target segments and plays
- Marketing and sales assets are co-developed and co-branded
- Lead routing, opportunity registration, and deal collaboration are clear
- Partner-sourced pipeline and revenue are tracked and attributed

**5) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT & OPTIMIZATION**
- KPIs are defined per partner tier (pipeline, revenue, satisfaction, engagement)
- Scorecards track activity, outcomes, and partnership health
- Performance reviews happen on schedule with action plans
- Partner feedback drives program iteration and improvement

**6) RELATIONSHIP DEPTH & TRUST**
- Executive sponsorship exists for strategic partnerships
- Relationship extends beyond single point of contact
- Partners feel valued and see mutual investment

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, partnership value realized, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **PARTNER PORTFOLIO MAP**
- Segment partners by tier and health (strategic/channel/tech; engaged/passive/at-risk)
- Highlight top performers, gaps in coverage, and at-risk relationships

4) **ENABLEMENT GAP ANALYSIS**
- Partner feedback on training, resources, and support effectiveness
- Recommendations for improving onboarding and ongoing enablement

5) **PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD**
- Per-partner: pipeline, revenue, deal count, engagement level, satisfaction score
- Top contributors and underperformers

- Actions to improve enablement, governance, and performance
- Metrics (partner-sourced revenue, engagement rate, satisfaction, time-to-first-deal)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad hoc, transactional, minimal enablement, low performance)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic processes, inconsistent execution, limited value)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, solid enablement, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (measured, high-performing, strong relationships, continuous improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (strategic, co-innovation, mutual growth, industry-leading)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {PARTNER_CONTEXT}: Partner types, count, tiers, current engagement, and tooling
- {OBJECTIVES}: Revenue, pipeline, market expansion, innovation, and satisfaction goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Resources, budget, tools, geographic reach, competitive dynamics

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {PARTNER_CONTEXT}: SaaS company with 25 partners (5 strategic, 15 channel, 5 tech integration). Partner-sourced revenue: $8M (20% of total). Tools: partner portal, Salesforce PRM.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Grow partner revenue to $15M (30% of total) in 12 months, improve partner satisfaction from 6.8 to 8.5/10, launch 3 co-innovation initiatives.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 2-person partner team; limited co-marketing budget; 40% of partners inactive; executive bandwidth limited.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.8 (Developing)
- Partner value: $8M revenue; 10 active partners; 15 passive/dormant
- Top improvements: (1) revitalize dormant partners via re-onboarding, (2) formalize QBR cadence, (3) launch co-sell playbook

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Partner Strategy & Value Proposition: 3/5 — tiers defined; value prop not validated
- Onboarding & Enablement: 2/5 — onboarding checklist exists; training outdated
- Governance & Communication: 3/5 — QBRs inconsistent (30% completion)
- Go-to-Market & Co-Selling: 2/5 — no joint GTM plan; lead routing unclear
- Performance Measurement: 3/5 — revenue tracked; engagement not measured
- Relationship Depth & Trust: 3/5 — exec sponsors for 3 partners; others single-threaded

**3) PARTNER PORTFOLIO MAP**
- Strategic (5 partners, $6M revenue): 3 engaged, 1 passive, 1 at-risk (champion left)
- Channel (15 partners, $2M revenue): 5 active, 7 passive, 3 dormant
- Tech integration (5 partners, $0 revenue): 2 launching, 3 stalled
- Coverage gaps: no partners in APAC; underserved SMB segment
- At-risk: Partner X ($1.5M ARR) — champion departed; no exec relationship

**4) ENABLEMENT GAP ANALYSIS**
- Partner feedback (from survey):
  - Training: 5/10 — outdated product training; no sales methodology
  - Resources: 6/10 — portal hard to navigate; no co-branded assets
  - Support: 7/10 — responsive but no dedicated partner SE
- Recommendations: refresh training quarterly; create co-sell playbook; assign partner SEs for top 10

**5) PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD**
- Top performers: Partner A ($2.5M, 12 deals, high engagement), Partner B ($2M, 8 deals)
- Underperformers: Partner D ($50K, 1 deal, low engagement), Partners E-G (dormant, $0)
- Avg time-to-first-deal: 6 months (goal: 3 months)
- Engagement rate: 40% of partners active in last 90 days
- Partner satisfaction: 6.8/10

**6) 30/60/90-DAY PARTNERSHIP PLAN**
- 30 days: re-onboard 7 passive partners; refresh training; deploy co-sell playbook
- 60 days: establish QBR cadence for top 10 partners; assign partner SEs; launch co-marketing campaign
- 90 days: launch 1 co-innovation pilot; expand APAC partner coverage; retire 3 dormant partners
- Metrics: partner revenue (goal $12M), active partner % (goal 70%), satisfaction (goal 8.5/10), time-to-first-deal (goal 3 months)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Segment partners by strategic value and tailor enablement, engagement, and resources accordingly.
2) Validate mutual value proposition early; ensure both sides see clear ROI.
3) Onboard with clear milestones and track time-to-first-deal as a leading indicator.
4) Formalize governance with regular QBRs for strategic partners and operational syncs for others.
5) Co-develop GTM assets and plays; avoid one-sided marketing that partners won't use.
6) Measure partner engagement (training completion, portal usage, deal reg) not just revenue.
7) Build exec-to-exec relationships in strategic partnerships; don't stay single-threaded.
8) Prune dormant partners annually; focus resources on those driving mutual value.
