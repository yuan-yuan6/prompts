# Change Management & Adoption Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to execute an organizational change with strong adoption and sustained behavior change. This framework scores maturity across six dimensions, pinpoints adoption risks, and produces a practical 30/60/90-day plan.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **change management readiness** for {CHANGE_CONTEXT}. The desired outcomes are {TARGET_OUTCOMES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a change management & adoption readiness assessment for {CHANGE_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (behaviors, artifacts, decisions, capacity).

**1) SPONSORSHIP & GOVERNANCE**
- Executive sponsor is active, visible, and accountable
- Decision rights, escalation paths, and cadence are defined
- Leaders align on “why now” and key tradeoffs
- Managers are equipped to reinforce change locally

**2) STAKEHOLDER INSIGHT & SEGMENTATION**
- Stakeholders segmented by impact, influence, and readiness
- Resistance drivers are identified (fear, workload, incentives, trust)
- Change capacity and change fatigue are assessed
- Champions network is credible and distributed across teams

**3) COMMUNICATION & MESSAGE DISCIPLINE**
- Core messages answer: why, what, when, WIIFM, support, expectations
- Multi-channel plan exists (leader cascade, team meetings, async updates)
- Feedback loops are present (listening sessions, FAQs, pulse checks)
- Messaging is consistent across levels and locations

**4) ENABLEMENT (TRAINING & SUPPORT)**
- Role-based training is scoped and scheduled
- Job aids, playbooks, and in-the-flow support are available
- Help channels and escalation are staffed (office hours, support desk)
- Dependencies (systems, policy, process) are addressed in enablement

**5) ADOPTION MEASUREMENT & LEADING INDICATORS**
- Clear adoption definition (usage, behavior, proficiency, outcomes)
- Baselines exist and instrumentation is feasible
- Leading indicators are tracked (completions, usage depth, error rates)
- Targets and reporting cadence are defined by audience

**6) REINFORCEMENT & SUSTAINABILITY**
- Incentives, performance expectations, and recognition align to change
- Process owners embed the change into SOPs and onboarding
- Risks to sustainment are mitigated (turnover, workload spikes)
- Continuous improvement loop exists (retro → iteration → re-communication)

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, biggest adoption risks, and the “one thing to fix first”

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **STAKEHOLDER & RESISTANCE MAP**
- Key groups, likely concerns, influence level, and engagement approach

4) **COMMUNICATION PLAN**
- Timeline by phase + channels + owners + key messages

5) **ENABLEMENT PLAN**
- Training paths, job aids, support model, and manager toolkit

6) **30/60/90-DAY ADOPTION & REINFORCEMENT PLAN**
- Actions, owners, dependencies, and metrics (leading + lagging)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, unclear ownership, inconsistent support)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic plan exists, gaps in insight and measurement)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, uneven execution at scale)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (measured adoption, strong reinforcement mechanisms)
- 5.0: Optimized (high trust, fast learning loops, durable behavior change)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {CHANGE_CONTEXT}: The change, scope, who is impacted, timeline, and dependencies
- {TARGET_OUTCOMES}: Adoption goals and business outcomes (measurable)
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Time, budget, capacity, tools, compliance, and delivery limits

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {CHANGE_CONTEXT}: Roll out a new CRM workflow and forecasting process across Sales (120 reps) and RevOps (18) in 6 weeks. Managers must run weekly pipeline reviews using the new stages. System is Salesforce with a new validation rule set.
- {TARGET_OUTCOMES}: 90% of opportunities use the new stages within 30 days; forecast accuracy improves from ±18% to ±10% by end of quarter; weekly pipeline reviews happen in every team.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Training time limited to 90 minutes per rep; two time zones; peak quarter-end workload; change team is 2 people.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.6 (Developing)
- Biggest risks: manager inconsistency, change fatigue at quarter-end, unclear “what good looks like” in pipeline reviews
- Fix first: create a manager toolkit with a single standard agenda, rubric, and examples

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Sponsorship & Governance: 3/5 — CRO supportive; escalation path unclear
- Stakeholder Insight: 2/5 — segmentation exists; resistance drivers not validated
- Communication: 3/5 — messages drafted; feedback loop missing
- Enablement: 2/5 — training planned; job aids not ready
- Measurement: 3/5 — Salesforce reports exist; leading indicators not defined
- Reinforcement: 2/5 — incentives/expectations not updated

**3) STAKEHOLDER & RESISTANCE MAP**
- Sales reps: concern about admin time → show “time saved” examples + shortcuts
- Sales managers: concern about accountability → provide rubric + office hours
- RevOps: concern about support load → define intake + triage + FAQ
- Finance: concern about forecast reliability → weekly readout with variance drivers

**4) COMMUNICATION PLAN**
- Week 0: sponsor announcement (why/what/when) + 1-page FAQ
- Weeks 1–2: manager cascade meetings + rep team meetings (live)
- Weeks 3–6: weekly adoption update + “top 5 pitfalls” micro-messages
- Ongoing: biweekly listening session + FAQ updates

**5) ENABLEMENT PLAN**
- Training: 60-min role-based training + 30-min hands-on lab
- Job aids: stage definition cheat sheet; pipeline review agenda; example “good opp”
- Support: daily office hours weeks 1–2; Slack channel with triage rules

**6) 30/60/90-DAY ADOPTION & REINFORCEMENT PLAN**
- 30 days: instrument adoption dashboard (stage usage, validation errors, time-in-stage)
- 60 days: update manager expectations + performance conversation guide
- 90 days: refine stages based on win/loss analysis; bake into onboarding
- Metrics: stage usage %, forecast variance, manager review completion rate

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Define adoption in behaviors, not just communications sent.
2) Equip managers first; they are the day-to-day change engine.
3) Segment stakeholders by impact and readiness; avoid one-size messaging.
4) Build two-way feedback loops (pulse checks, office hours, FAQs).
5) Make enablement role-based with job aids that fit real workflows.
6) Track leading indicators early (usage depth, errors, participation).
7) Align incentives and expectations so the new way is the easiest way.
8) Reinforce after launch with retros and iteration, not “set and forget”.
