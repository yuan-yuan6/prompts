# Budget Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build a sustainable budget across six dimensions: goals, cashflow clarity, budgeting method, spending controls, tools/automation, and review habits.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **budget readiness** for **{HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT}** pursuing **{FINANCIAL_GOALS}** within **{CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension **1–5**, explain why, and provide a 30-day setup plan (weekly steps), plus success metrics.

---

## Template

Conduct a budget planning readiness assessment for {HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT} pursuing {FINANCIAL_GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) GOALS & PRIORITIES**
- Clear goals (stability, debt payoff, savings, investing) with timelines
- “Must-haves” vs “nice-to-haves” defined
- Decision rules for tradeoffs (what gets cut first)

**2) CASHFLOW CLARITY**
- Reliable picture of income timing and variability
- Accurate baseline spending (last 30–90 days)
- Known irregular expenses (annual bills, gifts, travel, repairs)

**3) BUDGET METHOD FIT**
- Chosen method matches reality (zero-based, envelope, 50/30/20, pay-yourself-first)
- Categories are simple and behaviorally useful
- Buffer plan exists (minimum viable month)

**4) SPENDING CONTROLS & HABITS**
- Clear guardrails (caps, thresholds, “pause” rules)
- Friction where needed (cool-off periods, separate accounts)
- Alignment between partners/household members (if applicable)

**5) TOOLS & AUTOMATION**
- Tracking method is sustainable (app, spreadsheet, envelope)
- Bills automated where safe; due dates consolidated
- Visibility is easy (weekly snapshot)

**6) REVIEW & ADJUSTMENT**
- Weekly check-in habit exists
- Monthly closeout and learning loop (what changed, what to tweak)
- Triggers for re-planning (income change, big expense, life change)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 30 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **BUDGET MODEL RECOMMENDATION**
- Recommended method + why
- 5–8 categories with starting targets
- “Irregulars” strategy (sinking funds) and buffer approach

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **30-DAY SETUP PLAN**
- Week 1–4 steps: tracking, category targets, automations, check-in ritual

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30-day targets: tracking completion rate, overspend incidents, savings rate, cash buffer days, stress score

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, unclear where money goes)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some tracking, inconsistent follow-through)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable budget, occasional surprises)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (predictable cashflow, goals funded reliably)
- 5.0: Optimized (simple system, self-correcting habits)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT} | Income, household, situation | “Single, salaried; variable bonus; high rent city” |
| {FINANCIAL_GOALS} | 1–3 concrete goals | “Build $3k buffer; pay off $6k card; save for trip” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “No complex spreadsheets; 20 min/week maintenance” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {HOUSEHOLD_CONTEXT}: Couple, one income stable and one variable freelance; rent is high; wants fewer money arguments
- {FINANCIAL_GOALS}: Build $5,000 emergency buffer; stop carrying credit card balance; save $200/month for travel
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 30 minutes per week max; prefers simple categories; income varies month-to-month

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.0/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) baseline cashflow + irregulars, (2) pick a method that works with variable income, (3) set weekly money check-in

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Goals & Priorities | 4.0 | Clear buffer and payoff goals | Add timeline and milestones |
| Cashflow Clarity | 2.5 | Variable income not modeled | Track last 90 days and identify minimum income |
| Budget Method Fit | 3.0 | Open to simple categories | Use a “minimum month” baseline + upside allocation |
| Spending Controls | 2.5 | Overspend happens on dining | Set cap + pause rule for discretionary |
| Tools & Automation | 3.5 | Will use app | Automate bills + sinking funds transfer |
| Review & Adjustment | 2.5 | No consistent check-in | 15-min weekly ritual |

3) **BUDGET MODEL RECOMMENDATION**
- Method: pay-yourself-first + simple caps
- Starting targets: Housing, Groceries, Transport, Bills, Discretionary, Savings, Debt payoff, Irregulars
- Irregulars: sinking fund for annual/quarterly costs; hold buffer for variable income months

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Surprise expenses → no sinking funds → create 3 sinking funds (auto, health, gifts)
- Gap 2: Variable income whiplash → no minimum-month plan → budget to minimum income; allocate upside
- Gap 3: Discretionary creep → weak guardrails → weekly discretionary cap + shared visibility
- Gap 4: No review rhythm → drift → calendar the check-in
- Gap 5: Stress conflicts → unclear rules → agree on “pause + discuss” threshold

5) **30-DAY SETUP PLAN**
- Week 1: track spending; list irregulars; pick categories
- Week 2: set caps; set automations (bills + savings + sinking funds)
- Week 3: run first weekly review; adjust caps based on reality
- Week 4: close month; set next month targets; define variable-income allocation rule

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Tracking completion: 0% → 90% of transactions captured
- Overspend incidents: weekly → ≤1/week
- Savings rate: 0% → ≥5%
- Cash buffer: 0 days → 10 days
- Money stress (self-rated): 7/10 → 5/10

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Budget to your real patterns** — use the last 30–90 days, not wishful thinking.
2) **Keep categories simple** — fewer buckets increases follow-through.
3) **Fund irregulars on purpose** — sinking funds prevent “surprise” expenses.
4) **Use a weekly check-in** — small course corrections beat monthly resets.
5) **Choose one method and run it 30 days** — avoid constant tool-hopping.
6) **Create guardrails for discretionary** — caps and pause rules reduce regret.
7) **Automate the important moves** — bills, savings, and debt payments first.
8) **Measure stability, not perfection** — fewer surprises and less stress is the win.
