# Landing Pages Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and optimize landing pages that deliver message-match, reduce friction, and improve conversion outcomes through disciplined testing.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess landing page readiness for [CAMPAIGN_NAME] promoting [OFFER] to [TARGET_AUDIENCE] from [TRAFFIC_SOURCE] with conversion goal [CONVERSION_GOAL]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Offer clarity & message-match, (2) Information architecture & UX, (3) Copy, proof & objection handling, (4) Technical performance & tracking, (5) Experimentation & optimization, (6) Compliance, accessibility & governance. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Offer Clarity & Message-Match
- 1 — Initial: Offer is unclear; page doesn’t match ad intent; benefits and outcomes are vague.
- 3 — Defined: Clear value proposition and outcome; page aligns to campaign promise and audience intent.
- 5 — Optimized: Offer is segmented by audience/stage; message-match is audited across ads, page, and follow-up.

### 2) Information Architecture & UX
- 1 — Initial: Confusing layout; poor scannability; friction points are unmeasured.
- 3 — Defined: Clear section flow; mobile-first design; form friction is minimized intentionally.
- 5 — Optimized: UX is continuously tuned based on behavior data; components are modular and reusable.

### 3) Copy, Proof & Objection Handling
- 1 — Initial: Generic copy; limited proof; objections ignored.
- 3 — Defined: Benefit-led copy; proof elements; objection handling near CTA.
- 5 — Optimized: Claims map to evidence; proof is targeted by segment; objection handling is tested and improved.

### 4) Technical Performance & Tracking
- 1 — Initial: Slow pages; broken tracking; unclear attribution; QA is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Performance targets; tracking verified; analytics events defined; QA checklist exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Performance and tracking are continuously monitored; data is reliable and consistent across tools.

### 5) Experimentation & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: No testing cadence; changes are subjective; learnings are not captured.
- 3 — Defined: A/B testing plan; prioritized hypotheses; analysis routines; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program with sound methods; component-level learnings reused; optimization ties to business outcomes.

### 6) Compliance, Accessibility & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Disclosures missing; accessibility not considered; approvals are ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance and accessibility checklist; ownership and approvals.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance embedded; compliance/a11y are built-in and auditable; updates are fast and safe.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence and top gaps
- Landing page brief (objective, audience, offer, proof, objections)
- Page structure outline and component plan
- Tracking plan (events, conversions, QA checks)
- Testing plan (hypotheses, variants, success metrics)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [CAMPAIGN_NAME]: Campaign name
- [OFFER]: Offer and conversion ask
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE]: Primary persona/segment
- [TRAFFIC_SOURCE]: Paid search, paid social, email, referral, etc.
- [CONVERSION_GOAL]: Demo, trial, purchase, download, signup
- [PROOF_ELEMENTS]: Testimonials, stats, logos, certifications, guarantees

## Example (Condensed)
- Campaign: SaaS free trial landing page from paid search
- Scores (1–5): Offer 3; UX 3; Copy/Proof 2; Tech/Tracking 2; Testing 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Weak proof placement; inconsistent event tracking; no test cadence
- 60-day priorities: Fix tracking + QA; add targeted proof and objection handling; run biweekly tests on headline/CTA/form friction
