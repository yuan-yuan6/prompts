## Best Practices
- **Start with executive summary, not company history** - Investors decide in 5 minutes; put your best case upfront
- **Show traction before projections** - One real customer validates more than perfect spreadsheets
- **Be specific about use of funds** - "Marketing" is vague; "3 sales reps at $120K each" shows clear thinking
- **Address obvious risks directly** - Ignoring competition or challenges kills credibility
- **Keep financial projections realistic** - Hockey stick growth projections signal inexperience; show how you'll actually scale
