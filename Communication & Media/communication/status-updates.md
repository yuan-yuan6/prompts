# Status Updates & Progress Reporting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver **clear, timely, and actionable status updates** that keep stakeholders informed, aligned, and able to make decisions. Use this to diagnose gaps in format, cadence, and issue escalation.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **status reporting readiness** for {REPORTING_CONTEXT}. The communication objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a status updates & progress reporting readiness assessment for {REPORTING_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (stakeholder satisfaction, decision velocity, issue resolution speed, rework frequency).

**1) CLARITY & STRUCTURE**
- Overall status (Red/Yellow/Green) is stated upfront with one-sentence summary
- Format is consistent and scannable (3-3-3: accomplishments, in-progress, upcoming)
- Key information is highlighted (not buried in paragraphs)
- Jargon is minimized; audience-appropriate detail level is used

**2) TIMELINESS & CADENCE**
- Reports are delivered on schedule (not late)
- Cadence matches stakeholder needs and project phase (daily/weekly/milestone-based)
- Ad hoc updates happen when critical issues emerge
- Reporting rhythm is predictable and reliable

**3) ISSUE & RISK TRANSPARENCY**
- Blockers and risks are flagged explicitly (not hidden)
- Each issue includes: description, impact, owner, and resolution plan/date
- Escalation criteria are clear and followed
- Stakeholders trust that problems surface early

**4) METRICS & EVIDENCE**
- Progress is quantified (% complete, velocity, burn rate, milestones)
- Trends are shown (not just point-in-time snapshots)
- Actuals vs. plan are compared with variance explanations
- Leading indicators (not just lagging) are tracked

**5) ACTIONABILITY & DECISION SUPPORT**
- Asks and decisions needed are explicit
- Stakeholders know what action to take (if any)
- Reports enable informed decisions without additional meetings
- Follow-up on prior decisions/actions is tracked

**6) EFFICIENCY & AUTOMATION**
- Report creation is low-friction (templates, dashboards, automation)
- Data is pulled from systems (not manually compiled)
- Distribution is automated (scheduled emails, dashboards, portals)
- Time spent on reporting is proportional to value delivered

---

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, stakeholder satisfaction, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **REPORTING AUDIT**
- Recent reports reviewed (3–5 examples): clarity, timeliness, issue transparency
- Common failure modes (late, unclear status, hidden issues)

4) **TEMPLATE & STYLE GUIDE**
- Standard status update template (sections, structure, visual cues)
- Best practices for writing clear, actionable updates

5) **AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES**
- Current manual steps and time spent
- Recommendations for dashboards, tooling, and workflow automation

6) **30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- Actions to improve clarity, timeliness, and transparency
- Metrics (on-time delivery, stakeholder satisfaction, issue resolution time)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (inconsistent, late, unclear, issues hidden)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic structure, gaps in timeliness and transparency)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable format, solid execution, room for automation)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (timely, clear, transparent, measured effectiveness)
- 5.0: Optimized (automated, real-time, high trust, decision-enabling)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {REPORTING_CONTEXT}: Team/project scope, stakeholder types, current cadence/format, tooling
- {OBJECTIVES}: Stakeholder satisfaction, decision velocity, issue resolution speed goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Time, tools, data availability, audience preferences, reporting burden

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {REPORTING_CONTEXT}: Product development team (12 engineers, 2 PMs) building SaaS platform. Weekly status to VP Product, monthly to exec team. Format: email + slide deck. Tools: Jira, Google Docs. Stakeholder feedback: "updates are often late" and "hard to tell if we're on track".
- {OBJECTIVES}: Deliver 100% on-time weekly updates, improve stakeholder clarity score from 6/10 to 8.5/10, reduce time spent on reporting from 4h/week to 1h/week.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: No budget for new tools; VP prefers email over dashboards; exec team wants slide deck; Jira data is incomplete.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.5 (Developing)
- Key issues: 40% of updates late, status (R/Y/G) not used, issues buried in prose, 4h/week manual effort
- Top improvements: (1) adopt standard template with R/Y/G, (2) automate Jira data pull, (3) surface blockers explicitly

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Clarity & Structure: 2/5 — no consistent format; status buried; hard to scan
- Timeliness & Cadence: 2/5 — 40% late; ad hoc updates inconsistent
- Issue & Risk Transparency: 2/5 — issues mentioned casually; no owner or resolution date
- Metrics & Evidence: 3/5 — some data present but inconsistent; no trends
- Actionability: 2/5 — asks not explicit; stakeholders unclear on action
- Efficiency & Automation: 2/5 — fully manual; 4h/week effort

**3) REPORTING AUDIT**
- Report 1 (Week 12): late by 1 day; status unclear (prose says "mostly on track"); blocker mentioned in paragraph 3 (no owner); VP asked for clarification in 2 follow-up emails
- Report 2 (Week 15): on time; included velocity chart (good); no R/Y/G indicator; upcoming work vague ("continue feature work")
- Report 3 (Month-end exec): 3 days late; slide deck 15 pages; execs asked "are we on track?" (unclear from deck)
- Common failure modes: late delivery (2/3), unclear status (3/3), issues not surfaced (2/3)

**4) TEMPLATE & STYLE GUIDE**
- Standard weekly status template:
  - **Overall Status:** [Green/Yellow/Red] — One-sentence summary
  - **This Week (Accomplishments):** 3 bullets with completed work
  - **In Progress:** 3 bullets with active work (% complete, expected completion)
  - **Next Week (Upcoming):** 3 bullets with planned work
  - **Blockers & Risks:** Table (Issue, Impact, Owner, Resolution Plan, ETA)
  - **Metrics:** Sprint velocity, story points completed/remaining, burn-down trend
  - **Decisions Needed:** Explicit asks with context and deadline
- Best practices: R/Y/G upfront, surface issues early, quantify progress, highlight asks

**5) AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES**
- Current manual steps: copy Jira tickets (1h), write prose summaries (1.5h), format email/slides (1h), chase missing data (0.5h)
- Recommendations:
  - Build Jira dashboard showing sprint progress, velocity, blockers (saves 1h)
  - Use email template with auto-populated Jira links (saves 0.5h)
  - Create slide deck template pulling from Jira API (saves 1h)
  - Total time savings: 2.5h/week (4h → 1.5h)

**6) 30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- 30 days: adopt standard template with R/Y/G; train team on blocker escalation; deliver 100% on-time updates
- 60 days: build Jira dashboard for sprint metrics; automate email template with Jira data pull
- 90 days: create slide deck template with API integration; measure stakeholder satisfaction via quarterly survey
- Metrics: on-time delivery (goal 100%), stakeholder clarity (goal 8.5/10), reporting time (goal 1.5h/week)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Start every update with Red/Yellow/Green and a one-sentence status summary.
2) Use a consistent format (3-3-3: accomplishments, in-progress, upcoming) for easy scanning.
3) Surface blockers and risks explicitly with owner, impact, and resolution plan.
4) Quantify progress with metrics (% complete, velocity, burn rate) and show trends.
5) Make asks and decisions explicit—stakeholders should know what action to take.
6) Deliver on schedule every time; reliability builds trust.
7) Automate data collection and formatting where possible to reduce manual effort.
8) Tailor detail level to audience—execs want summary, team wants specifics.
