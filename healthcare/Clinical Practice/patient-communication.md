# Patient Communication Template

## Purpose
Develop effective patient communication strategies including education, instructions, and counseling to improve health outcomes, adherence, and patient satisfaction.

## Quick Start

**Need to communicate with patients quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Create patient education materials for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes patients. The communication should explain blood sugar monitoring, medication adherence, dietary changes, and exercise recommendations in simple terms for patients with basic health literacy. Use a supportive, encouraging tone and include visual aids.
```

### When to Use This
- Explaining diagnoses, treatment plans, or procedures to patients
- Creating patient education materials and discharge instructions
- Delivering difficult news or discussing treatment options
- Improving medication adherence and lifestyle changes

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Assess patient needs** - Consider health literacy, language, cultural factors
2. **Tailor communication** - Use appropriate language level and format
3. **Verify understanding** - Use teach-back method to confirm comprehension

**Time to complete**: 15-30 minutes for routine education, 45-60 minutes for complex discussions
