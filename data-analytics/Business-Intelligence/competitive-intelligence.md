# Competitive Intelligence Benchmarking Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive frameworks for market analysis, competitor benchmarking, and strategic intelligence gathering that enable data-driven competitive positioning, market opportunity identification, and strategic advantage creation.

## Quick Start

**Need competitive intelligence fast?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Analyze 3 top competitors by comparing: market share, pricing strategy, product features, customer reviews/ratings, and recent strategic moves. Create a SWOT analysis showing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Summarize findings in a competitive positioning matrix with actionable recommendations.
```

### When to Use This
- Strategic planning and market positioning
- Product development and feature prioritization
- Pricing strategy and competitive pricing
- Market entry and expansion decisions

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Identify competitors** - Select 3-5 key competitors to analyze
2. **Gather intelligence** - Collect data on positioning, pricing, features, and performance
3. **Analyze and report** - Create comparative analysis with strategic recommendations

**Time to complete**: 3-5 days for basic analysis, 2-4 weeks for comprehensive intelligence
