## Quick Start

**Launch Your UX Project in 1 Hour**

1. **Talk to 3 Users** (20 min): Ask "What's frustrating?" and "What do you wish existed?"
2. **Sketch 5 Screens** (15 min): Paper sketches of key flows - boxes and arrows only
3. **Pick Your Path** (10 min): Mobile app, web app, or responsive site?
4. **Build Quick Prototype** (15 min): Use Figma/Sketch or even PowerPoint - make it clickable

**Project-Type Fast Tracks**:
- **New Product**: Start Section 1 (User Research) → Understand before you design
- **Redesign**: Jump to Section 6 (Usability Testing) → Find what's broken first
- **Design System**: Begin Section 4 (Visual Design) → Components before pages

**UX Truth**: You can't design for everyone. Pick your primary user and serve them obsessively.

**Power Move**: Fill `[PRIMARY_USER_GROUPS]` and `[CORE_USER_NEEDS]` - everything else follows!
