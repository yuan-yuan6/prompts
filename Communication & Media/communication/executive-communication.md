# Executive Communication & Briefings Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for crafting executive-level communications, briefings, and presentations that deliver strategic insights, drive decision-making, and ensure leadership alignment.

## Quick Executive Communication Prompt

Prepare an executive briefing for [audience/role] on [topic/issue]. Lead with recommendation for [decision needed], support with data showing [key metrics/impact], present options including [alternatives], address risks of [concern areas], and request decision by [deadline]. Format for [time allocation] with backup materials covering [anticipated questions]. Include next steps pending approval.

## Quick Start

**Need to brief executives quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Audience: CEO and CFO
Purpose: Decision needed on major vendor failure contingency plan
Time available: 15-minute briefing before board call
Key message: Vendor X failure threatens Q4 delivery, recommend activating backup plan at $500K cost
Decision: Approve contingency activation and stakeholder communication
```

### When to Use This
- Preparing urgent executive decision briefings
- Creating quarterly executive performance updates
- Developing C-suite presentations for strategic initiatives
- Managing crisis communications to leadership

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Structure Message** - Lead with recommendation, support with key data, clearly state decision needed
2. **Visualize Impact** - Create executive dashboard showing performance, risks, and scenarios
3. **Prepare Delivery** - Anticipate questions, prepare backup materials, and plan follow-up actions

**Time to complete**: 30 minutes for urgent briefing, 2-4 hours for comprehensive executive presentation
