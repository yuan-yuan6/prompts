# Crisis Communication & Rapid Response Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to **respond to crises swiftly, transparently, and credibly**—protecting reputation, maintaining stakeholder trust, and enabling rapid recovery. Use this to diagnose gaps in preparedness, response protocols, and post-crisis learning.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **crisis communication readiness** for {CRISIS_CONTEXT}. The response objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a crisis communication & rapid response readiness assessment for {CRISIS_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (response time, message consistency, stakeholder sentiment, recovery speed).

**1) PREPAREDNESS & CRISIS PLANNING**
- Crisis response plan exists with roles, decision rights, and escalation paths
- Crisis scenarios are identified and playbooks are documented
- Spokesperson training and media kits are current
- Contact lists (team, legal, PR, regulators) are maintained and tested

**2) RAPID DETECTION & ACTIVATION**
- Monitoring tools detect issues early (social, media, ops, support tickets)
- Activation triggers and thresholds are defined
- Crisis team can assemble within 1–2 hours
- Fact verification and legal review happen in parallel (not sequentially)

**3) MESSAGE DISCIPLINE & STAKEHOLDER COORDINATION**
- Holding statement can be issued within 2 hours
- Core messages (facts, accountability, actions, support) are consistent across channels
- Stakeholder sequencing is clear (employees → customers → media → public)
- Spokesperson stays on message; unapproved voices are controlled

**4) CHANNEL EXECUTION & MEDIA RELATIONS**
- Multi-channel execution is coordinated (website, social, email, press, phone)
- Media inquiries are routed to trained spokesperson
- Social media is monitored 24/7 during crisis; responses are rapid and empathetic
- Crisis microsite or FAQ page is deployed within 4 hours

**5) TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY & EMPATHY**
- Messaging acknowledges impact and takes accountability (no defensiveness)
- Information is shared proactively (not just in response to questions)
- Regular updates happen even when "no new information" exists
- Empathy and support for affected stakeholders is evident in tone and actions

**6) RECOVERY & POST-CRISIS LEARNING**
- Recovery plan exists with corrective actions, timelines, and owners
- Post-crisis debrief happens within 1 week to capture lessons
- Reputation recovery actions are tracked and measured
- Crisis plan is updated based on lessons learned

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, biggest response gaps, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **CRISIS SCENARIO MATRIX**
- Top 5 crisis scenarios, current preparedness level, and gaps per scenario

4) **RAPID RESPONSE PLAYBOOK**
- Hour-by-hour timeline (0–2h, 2–6h, 6–24h, 24–72h, recovery)
- Roles, artifacts, channels, and decision points

5) **STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION MAP**
- Per stakeholder group: message priorities, channels, cadence, spokesperson

6) **30/60/90-DAY CRISIS READINESS PLAN**
- Actions to improve preparedness, response speed, and post-crisis recovery
- Metrics (detection time, response time, sentiment recovery, stakeholder trust)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, slow, inconsistent, reputational damage)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic plan exists, gaps in speed and coordination)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable process, solid execution, room for optimization)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (proactive, fast, transparent, strong trust recovery)
- 5.0: Optimized (anticipates crises, exemplary response, reputation strengthened)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {CRISIS_CONTEXT}: Org profile, likely crisis types, past incidents, current preparedness level
- {OBJECTIVES}: Response time, trust preservation, reputation recovery goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Team size, tools, legal/regulatory requirements, geographic complexity

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {CRISIS_CONTEXT}: Healthcare provider (4 hospitals, 2,500 staff). Likely crises: data breach, patient safety incident, regulatory violation, natural disaster. Last crisis (data breach 18 months ago): 8-hour response delay, inconsistent messaging, patient trust dropped 15 points. No crisis plan update since.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Reduce response time to <2 hours for holding statement, maintain patient trust >80% during crisis, recover reputation to baseline within 90 days.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 2-person comms team; legal approval required for all external statements; 24/7 ops but no dedicated crisis monitoring; HIPAA restrictions on disclosure.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.4 (Developing)
- Biggest gaps: no updated crisis plan, 8-hour response time, legal bottleneck, no post-crisis debrief conducted
- Fix first: update crisis plan with playbooks, pre-approve holding statement templates, establish crisis monitoring

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Preparedness & Planning: 2/5 — outdated plan; no playbooks; spokesperson untrained
- Rapid Detection & Activation: 2/5 — no monitoring; 8h delay last time
- Message Discipline: 2/5 — inconsistent messaging; no stakeholder sequencing
- Channel Execution: 3/5 — website works; social media reactive
- Transparency & Accountability: 3/5 — eventually transparent but too slow
- Recovery & Learning: 1/5 — no debrief; no plan update; no reputation tracking

**3) CRISIS SCENARIO MATRIX**
- Data breach: preparedness 2/5 (gaps: HIPAA notification timeline unclear, patient comms template missing)
- Patient safety incident: preparedness 2/5 (gaps: clinical vs. comms roles unclear, media training needed)
- Regulatory violation: preparedness 3/5 (gaps: spokesperson designation for compliance issues, timeline for disclosure)
- Natural disaster: preparedness 3/5 (gaps: backup comms channels, staff family notification process)
- Workforce issue (strike, walkout): preparedness 1/5 (gaps: no plan, no messaging, no liaison with HR/legal)

**4) RAPID RESPONSE PLAYBOOK**
- 0–1h: detect issue via ops/social/media → notify crisis lead → assemble core team (comms, legal, ops, CEO) → verify facts
- 1–2h: legal approves holding statement → post to website/social → notify employees → brief board
- 2–6h: issue detailed statement with facts, actions, support resources → media inquiries routed to trained spokesperson → deploy FAQ microsite → notify regulators if required
- 6–24h: provide first update with corrective actions → monitor sentiment → prepare executive briefing for next business day
- 24–72h: regular updates (every 12–24h) → stakeholder outreach (patients, partners, community) → internal town hall
- Recovery: corrective actions tracked → reputation metrics monitored → debrief within 1 week → plan updated

**5) STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION MAP**
- Employees: priority = situational awareness + role clarity; channels = email + Slack + manager cascade; cadence = immediate + every 6h; spokesperson = CEO
- Patients (impacted): priority = safety + support + transparency; channels = phone + email + patient portal; cadence = immediate + daily; spokesperson = Chief Medical Officer
- Media: priority = facts + accountability + corrective actions; channels = press release + spokesperson interview; cadence = holding statement → detailed statement → updates as warranted; spokesperson = CEO or CMO (trained)
- Regulators: priority = compliance + cooperation; channels = direct notification + written report; cadence = per regulatory timeline; spokesperson = Chief Compliance Officer
- Board: priority = situational update + risk assessment; channels = email brief + emergency meeting; cadence = within 2h + daily; spokesperson = CEO

**6) 30/60/90-DAY CRISIS READINESS PLAN**
- 30 days: update crisis plan with playbooks for top 3 scenarios; pre-approve holding statement templates; establish crisis monitoring (social + media alerts)
- 60 days: train CEO and CMO as spokespersons; conduct tabletop exercise for data breach scenario; create crisis microsite framework
- 90 days: test rapid response playbook with full team; implement reputation tracking dashboard; establish quarterly crisis plan review
- Metrics: detection time (goal <30 min), holding statement time (goal <2h), patient trust during crisis (goal >80%), reputation recovery (goal baseline within 90 days)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Maintain an updated crisis plan with playbooks, roles, and pre-approved templates.
2) Monitor social media, news, and operations 24/7 for early detection.
3) Issue a holding statement within 2 hours acknowledging the situation and committing to transparency.
4) Sequence stakeholder communication: employees first, then affected parties, then media/public.
5) Stay on message with consistent facts, accountability, and actions across all channels.
6) Provide regular updates even when there's "no new information"—silence fuels rumors.
7) Show empathy and accountability in tone and actions; avoid defensiveness.
8) Conduct a post-crisis debrief within 1 week and update the crisis plan based on lessons learned.
