# Employee Relations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage employee relations issues consistently with fair processes, compliant documentation, and effective resolution outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess employee relations readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with [EMPLOYEE_COUNT] employees. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Policies & standards, (2) Intake & triage, (3) Investigation & documentation, (4) Resolution & remediation, (5) Manager enablement & communications, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Policies & Standards
- 1 — Initial: Policies unclear; inconsistent enforcement.
- 3 — Defined: Policies and procedures documented; training exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Standards are consistently applied; trust and compliance improve.

### 2) Intake & Triage
- 1 — Initial: Issues handled ad-hoc; escalation paths unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Intake channels and triage criteria; response SLAs.
- 5 — Optimized: Triage is fast and consistent; high-risk issues flagged early.

### 3) Investigation & Documentation
- 1 — Initial: Investigations inconsistent; documentation incomplete.
- 3 — Defined: Investigation process and templates; evidence handling standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Investigations are reliable, timely, and auditable.

### 4) Resolution & Remediation
- 1 — Initial: Resolutions vary; follow-through inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Resolution options and remediation plans; action tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Remediation is effective; recurrence declines.

### 5) Manager Enablement & Communications
- 1 — Initial: Managers unsure how to respond; messaging inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Manager guidance and comms templates; coaching resources.
- 5 — Optimized: Managers respond consistently; communication builds trust.

### 6) Measurement & Continuous Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No trend tracking; issues repeat.
- 3 — Defined: Case categories and trend reporting; review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Trends drive prevention; policies and training improve outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Employee relations readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Intake and triage workflow with SLAs
- Investigation templates and documentation standards
- Resolution and remediation playbook
- Trend dashboard and prevention plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [EMPLOYEE_COUNT]: Employee count
- [POLICY_SET]: Policies
- [SLA_HOURS]: Response SLA
- [CASE_TYPES]: Case categories
- [ESCALATION_PATH]: Escalation path

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Rapidly growing team with inconsistent ER handling
- Scores (1–5): Policies 3; Triage 2; Investigation 2; Resolution 2; Enablement 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define triage SLAs; standardize investigation templates; implement trend review cadence and manager enablement
