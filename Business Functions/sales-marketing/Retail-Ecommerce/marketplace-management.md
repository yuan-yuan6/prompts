# Marketplace Management Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive marketplace optimization strategies, multi-channel selling frameworks, platform-specific tactics, and performance analytics that maximize sales, visibility, and profitability across digital marketplaces.

## Quick Marketplace Management Prompt
Optimize marketplace presence for [COMPANY_NAME] selling [SKU_COUNT] SKUs across [PLATFORM_COUNT] platforms: [PLATFORMS] (Amazon/Walmart/eBay/Etsy). Set up FBA/fulfillment for Prime eligibility. Implement automated repricing within [PRICE_VARIANCE]% of Buy Box. Launch sponsored ads at [ACOS_TARGET]% ACoS targeting [KEYWORD_COUNT] keywords. Monitor seller metrics: Order Defect Rate <[ODR_TARGET]%, Late Shipment <[LSR_TARGET]%. Target [REVENUE_TARGET] monthly revenue, [CONVERSION_TARGET]% conversion, and [PROFIT_MARGIN]% profit margin.

## Quick Start

**For E-commerce Managers launching on Amazon:**
1. Start with 50-100 SKUs in your strongest category
2. Set up FBA for Prime eligibility to capture 70%+ of Amazon traffic
3. Implement automated repricing within 5% of Buy Box price
4. Run Sponsored Product ads at 10-15% ACoS targeting high-intent keywords
5. Monitor Order Defect Rate (<1%) and Late Shipment Rate (<4%) daily

**For Multi-Channel Sellers expanding platforms:**
1. Choose 2-3 complementary platforms based on your category performance
2. Set up centralized inventory management to prevent overselling
3. Create platform-specific listing optimization (Amazon vs Walmart vs eBay)
4. Establish channel-specific pricing strategies with 5-10% variance tolerance
5. Implement unified customer service across all channels within 24 hours

**Expected Timeline:** Week 1: Platform setup and listing migration | Week 2-4: Initial optimization and testing | Month 2-3: Scaling and automation | Month 4+: Performance optimization and expansion
