## Purpose
Create comprehensive wealth management and financial planning strategies covering goal setting, cash flow optimization, retirement planning, tax strategies, estate planning, insurance protection, and education funding to maximize client wealth preservation, growth, and transfer while ensuring financial security and legacy achievement.

## Quick Start

Create an effective wealth management plan in 1-2 hours with these practical examples:

### Example 1: Young Professional Financial Plan
Develop comprehensive plan for 35-year-old client:
```
Client Profile:
- Age: 35, married, 2 young children
- Income: $150K combined household
- Net Worth: $250K ($150K retirement, $75K home equity, $25K cash)
- Goals: Save for college, buy larger home, retire comfortably
- Risk Tolerance: Moderate-aggressive (long time horizon)

Quick Financial Snapshot:
Monthly Income: $12,500 gross ($9,200 net after taxes)
Monthly Expenses: $7,500
Monthly Savings: $1,700 (18.5% savings rate - good!)

Priority Actions (Next 90 Days):
1. Emergency Fund: Increase from $25K to $45K
   Action: Automate $500/month to high-yield savings (4.5% APY)

2. Retirement: Boost from 12% to 15% of income
   Action: Increase 401(k) to $1,500/month ($22.5K/year, get full match)

3. College Savings: Start 529 plans for children (ages 2 and 4)
   Action: Contribute $300/month per child ($7,200/year total)
   Projection: $190K per child by age 18 (7% growth assumption)

4. Insurance Gap: Add term life insurance
   Action: Purchase $1M 30-year term policies ($75/month combined)

5. Estate Planning: Create basic documents
   Action: Execute wills, healthcare proxies, guardian designations

Year 1 Financial Plan Summary:
- Emergency fund: Complete in 4 months
- Retirement savings: $27K annually (18% of income)
- College savings: $7.2K annually
- Insurance: $900 annually
- Estate docs: $2,000 one-time
Total Commitment: $37.1K/year (24% of gross income)
```

### Example 2: Pre-Retiree Planning
Retirement readiness assessment for 58-year-old client:
```
Client Profile:
- Age: 58, single, plans to retire at 65

- Assets: $1.5M ($1.2M retirement accounts, $300K taxable)
- Social Security: $2,800/month at age 67
- Pension: None
- Desired retirement income: $120K/year

Retirement Readiness Calculation:
Current savings: $1.5M
Years to retirement: 7
Additional contributions: $30K/year (max 401k + catch-up)
Expected value at 65: $2.3M (assuming 6% growth)

Retirement Income Analysis:
Portfolio withdrawals: $92K/year (4% safe withdrawal rate)
Social Security (delayed to 70): $3,900/month = $47K/year
Total Income: $139K/year
Target: $120K/year
Status: ✓ ON TRACK (with buffer)

Pre-Retirement Action Plan:
1. Maximize Retirement Contributions:
   - 401(k): $30,000/year ($23K + $7.5K catch-up)
   - HSA: $4,850/year (for healthcare costs)
   - Total: $34,850/year

2. Tax Optimization Strategy:
   - Convert $30K/year to Roth IRA (fill 24% bracket)

   - Reduces RMDs at age 73

3. Social Security Strategy:
   - Delay claiming until age 70 for 124% of FRA benefit
   - Use portfolio withdrawals ages 65-70

4. Healthcare Planning:
   - Max out HSA for retirement healthcare ($50K by age 65)

Current Tax Situation:
