# Wealth Management Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready you are to deliver a comprehensive wealth management strategy across goal setting, investment management, tax/retirement/estate planning, risk protection, and implementation governance with consistent inputs, documented decisions, and client-ready deliverables.

## Quick Prompt
Assess wealth strategy readiness for [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME] at [NET_WORTH_LEVEL]. Evaluate discovery and goal clarity, investment policy and execution, tax and retirement planning capability, estate and legacy readiness, insurance and protection coverage, and implementation/review governance. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Client Discovery & Goal Formulation
- 1: Goals are vague; inputs are incomplete or unreconciled.
- 3: Goals and inputs are documented; prioritization is partial.
- 5: Goals are specific, reconciled, and translated into decision rules with tradeoffs.

2) Investment Strategy & Portfolio Execution
- 1: Allocation is improvised; rebalancing is reactive.
- 3: Policy exists; implementation and costs are partially addressed.
- 5: IPS-level policy with asset location, rebalancing rules, and cost discipline.

3) Tax & Retirement Planning Capability
- 1: Tax picture is unclear; retirement is unmodeled.
- 3: Basic tax view and projections exist; sequencing is partially defined.
- 5: Multi-year tax strategy and scenario-driven retirement income plan.

4) Estate Planning & Legacy Readiness
- 1: Documents and beneficiaries are missing or stale.
- 3: Documents exist; alignment to titling is incomplete.
- 5: Documents, titling, beneficiaries, and governance are aligned and reviewed.

5) Risk Protection & Insurance Coverage
- 1: Coverage gaps and limits are unknown; adequacy is untested.
- 3: Inventory exists; assumptions may be outdated.
- 5: Coverage is current, sized to goals, and reviewed on cadence.

6) Implementation Governance & Accountability
- 1: Recommendations aren't tracked; reviews are sporadic.
- 3: Plans exist; owners and follow-through vary.
- 5: Sequenced tracker with owners, dates, evidence, and fixed review cadence.

## Deliverables
- Client discovery summary (goals, cash flow, balance sheet, risk profile)
- Investment policy and allocation plan (targets, ranges, costs, rebalancing)
- Tax and retirement planning memo (scenarios, sequencing, triggers)
- Estate readiness checklist (documents, titling, beneficiaries)
- Insurance coverage summary (inventory, adequacy, assumptions)
- Implementation tracker (actions, owners, dates, evidence)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — decisions are case-by-case; gaps discovered late.
- Level 2: Documented — plans exist; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — consistent analysis and implementation for most clients.
- Level 4: Managed — scenario-driven decisions with tracking and accountability.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from outcomes and reviews.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]
- [NET_WORTH_LEVEL]
- [LIFE_STAGE]
- [GOALS_PRIORITIZED]
- [RISK_TOLERANCE]
- [CURRENT_ALLOCATION]
- [TAX_JURISDICTION]
- [ESTATE_DOCUMENTS_STATUS]

## Example (Condensed)

- Start: reconcile inputs, confirm beneficiaries, size insurance.
- Execute: define IPS, model tax/retirement scenarios, track actions.
- Review: quarterly tracker with triggers for allocation, tax, and coverage.
