# Literature Reviews Overview

## Purpose
This overview provides guidance on conducting comprehensive literature reviews, including systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, and research syntheses. Use this as a starting point to understand the literature review process and select the appropriate focused prompt for your specific needs.

## What is a Literature Review?

A literature review is a comprehensive analysis of existing research on a specific topic that:
- Synthesizes current knowledge and evidence
- Identifies patterns, themes, and trends
- Evaluates research quality and methodological rigor
- Identifies knowledge gaps and research priorities
- Establishes theoretical foundations
- Informs evidence-based practice and policy

## Types of Literature Reviews

### Systematic Review
Rigorous, protocol-driven review using explicit methods to minimize bias, often including meta-analysis for quantitative synthesis of results.

### Narrative Review
Comprehensive overview providing context and interpretation, synthesizing findings across diverse studies without strict systematic methodology.

### Meta-Analysis
Statistical synthesis of quantitative data from multiple studies to estimate overall effect sizes and identify patterns.

### Scoping Review
Exploratory review mapping the breadth of literature, identifying key concepts, evidence types, and research gaps.

### Integrative Review
Synthesis combining diverse methodologies and perspectives to generate new frameworks or theoretical models.

## The Literature Review Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Strategy (Weeks 1-4)
**Use: literature-search-strategy.md**
- Define research questions and objectives
- Develop comprehensive search strategy
- Select appropriate databases and sources
- Design search strings with Boolean logic
- Plan citation tracking methods

### Phase 2: Screening and Selection (Weeks 5-12)
**Use: literature-screening-selection.md**
- Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Conduct multi-stage screening process
- Assess study quality and risk of bias
- Follow PRISMA flow diagram methodology
- Extract data systematically

### Phase 3: Analysis and Synthesis (Weeks 13-20)
**Use: literature-synthesis-analysis.md**
- Conduct thematic analysis
- Perform quantitative or qualitative synthesis
- Integrate evidence across studies
- Develop conceptual frameworks
- Identify patterns and gaps

### Phase 4: Writing and Organization (Weeks 21-24)
**Use: systematic-review-writing.md**
- Structure review sections logically
- Write critical analysis and discussion
- Develop evidence-based recommendations
- Ensure methodological transparency
- Address limitations and implications

### Phase 5: Citation and Documentation (Ongoing)
**Use: citation-reference-management.md**
- Manage references with citation software
- Format citations and bibliographies
- Ensure proper attribution
- Avoid plagiarism
- Maintain documentation standards

## Common Reporting Guidelines

- **PRISMA**: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
- **MOOSE**: Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
- **ENTREQ**: Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the synthesis of Qualitative research
- **RAMESES**: Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards
- **GRADE**: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation

## Getting Started

1. **Define your research question** using PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
2. **Choose review type** based on your research objectives and available resources
3. **Select appropriate focused prompts** from the 5 specialized templates
4. **Follow the systematic process** outlined in each focused prompt
5. **Maintain methodological rigor** throughout all stages
6. **Document thoroughly** for transparency and reproducibility

## Best Practices

1. **Register your protocol** (e.g., PROSPERO for systematic reviews)
2. **Use multiple reviewers** to reduce bias and improve reliability
3. **Document decisions** throughout the selection and analysis process
4. **Update searches** before final submission to capture recent publications
5. **Engage stakeholders** including end-users and content experts
6. **Plan for dissemination** beyond academic publication
7. **Consider equity and inclusion** in search and analysis strategies
8. **Acknowledge limitations** transparently in reporting

## Tips for Success

- Start with a clear, focused research question
- Allocate sufficient time for each phase (typically 6-12 months for systematic reviews)
- Use reference management software from the beginning
- Maintain organized documentation of all decisions
- Seek methodological expertise when needed
- Build in peer review and validation checkpoints
- Plan for iterative refinement of search strategies
- Consider resource constraints realistically
