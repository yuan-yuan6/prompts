# Performance Review System Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to implement and operate a performance review system with clear workflows, governance, and data that supports fair outcomes and development.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess performance review system readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with cadence [REVIEW_CADENCE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Review design & objectives, (2) Workflow & tooling, (3) Manager enablement, (4) Calibration & governance, (5) Communications & change management, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a rollout plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Review Design & Objectives
- 1 — Initial: Objectives unclear; review steps are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Review objectives and forms defined; scope and timeline documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Design is optimized; workload is balanced; outcomes are reliable.

### 2) Workflow & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Workflows are manual; reminders and tracking are weak.
- 3 — Defined: Tooling supports forms, reminders, approvals, and reporting.
- 5 — Optimized: Workflow is automated and reliable; cycle time is predictable.

### 3) Manager Enablement
- 1 — Initial: Managers lack guidance; review quality varies widely.
- 3 — Defined: Training and templates; examples of good feedback.
- 5 — Optimized: Enablement is continuous; quality and consistency are high.

### 4) Calibration & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Calibration absent; outcomes inconsistent or biased.
- 3 — Defined: Calibration process, decision rights, and documentation standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance is strong; decisions are fair, auditable, and consistent.

### 5) Communications & Change Management
- 1 — Initial: Employees confused by process; trust is low.
- 3 — Defined: Clear communications plan; FAQs; expectations set early.
- 5 — Optimized: High trust and transparency; adoption is smooth.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No measurement; issues surface late.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs tracked (completion, cycle time, distributions); retrospectives.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement reduces friction and improves outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Review system readiness scorecard and gap list
- End-to-end review workflow with owners and dates
- Tooling requirements and reporting spec
- Manager enablement content (training, templates)
- Calibration governance and measurement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [REVIEW_CADENCE]: Review cadence
- [TOOL]: HRIS/performance tool
- [RATING_SCALE]: Rating model
- [CALIBRATION_LEVELS]: Calibration levels
- [COMMUNICATION_PLAN]: Communications plan

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Moving from ad-hoc reviews to quarterly cycle
- Scores (1–5): Design 3; Workflow 2; Enablement 2; Governance 2; Comms 3; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Implement tooling workflow; build manager training; define calibration governance and KPI reporting
