# Financial Ratio Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to produce ratio analysis that is consistent, comparable, and decision-grade (credit review, board reporting, investment memos).

## Quick Prompt
Assess ratio analysis readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] in [INDUSTRY_SECTOR] for [ANALYSIS_PERIOD]. Evaluate data completeness and reconciliation, ratio definition standards, peer benchmarking discipline, interpretation and narrative quality, tooling/auditability, and review governance. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Data Inputs & Reconciliation
- 1: Statements are incomplete; figures don’t reconcile; adjustments are informal.
- 3: Standard statements exist; reconciliations and normalization happen for major cycles.
- 5: Traceable sources, reconciliation checks, and documented adjustments are standard.

2) Ratio Definitions & Calculation Standards
- 1: Teams use different definitions and cutoffs.
- 3: A core ratio list exists but exceptions are common.
- 5: Definitions, formulas, and treatment of one-time items are standardized and enforced.

3) Peer Set & Benchmarking Discipline
- 1: Comparables are selected ad hoc; benchmark sources aren’t cited.
- 3: Peer sets used for key decisions; updates are periodic.
- 5: Peer selection criteria, benchmark sources, and refresh cadence are defined and repeatable.

4) Interpretation, Drivers & Narrative
- 1: Ratios are listed without explanations.
- 3: Key movements are described with partial driver analysis.
- 5: Drivers, bridges, and business context connect ratios to actionable conclusions.

5) Tooling, Reproducibility & Auditability
- 1: Manual spreadsheets; hard-coded logic; hard to reproduce.
- 3: Shared workbooks and some versioning.
- 5: Clear inputs/outputs, controlled changes, QA checks, and reproducible calculations.

6) Review, Governance & Decision Use
- 1: No review checklist; results vary by analyst.
- 3: Reviews occur for high-stakes outputs.
- 5: Review gates, sign-offs, and decision criteria are consistent.

## Deliverables
- Ratio definition sheet (formulas and treatment rules)
- Ratio table (current, prior periods, and peer benchmarks)
- Trend and driver commentary (what changed and why)
- Flags and questions list (data gaps, anomalies, follow-ups)
- Recommendation summary aligned to the decision context

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — ratios computed inconsistently; weak comparability.
- Level 2: Documented — common templates exist; enforcement is inconsistent.
- Level 3: Repeatable — core ratio set, benchmarks, and commentary are standard.
- Level 4: Managed — QA, governance, and driver narratives are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvements via outcomes and feedback loops.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [ANALYSIS_PERIOD]
- [STATEMENT_YEARS]
- [PEER_SET] (3–5 peers)
- [ACCOUNTING_POLICY_NOTES] (lease accounting, revenue recognition)
- [NORMALIZATION_ADJUSTMENTS] (one-time items, FX, divestitures)
- [DECISION_CONTEXT] (credit review, board update, investment memo)

## Example (Condensed)
Credit review for a retail distributor.
- Inputs: 3-year statements reconciled; one-time restructuring charge normalized.
- Benchmarks: peer medians and historical ranges.
- Findings: liquidity improving but leverage elevated; interest coverage sensitive to margin compression.
- Output: ratio table + trend commentary + key questions for management.
