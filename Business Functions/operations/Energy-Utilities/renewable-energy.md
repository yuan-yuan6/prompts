# Renewable Energy Implementation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to implement renewable energy projects with consistent delivery, commissioning, and operational performance.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess project implementation readiness for renewable project [PROJECT]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Scope & permitting, (2) Engineering & design, (3) Procurement & supply chain, (4) Construction & commissioning, (5) Operations & monitoring, (6) Governance & risk. Provide a scorecard and delivery plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Permitting
- 1 — Initial: Permitting unclear; scope unstable.
- 3 — Defined: Permits and scope defined; change control exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Scope and permitting are stable with disciplined management.

### 2) Engineering & Design
- 1 — Initial: Design incomplete; standards inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Design standards and reviews; interfaces documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Design is mature; issues are caught early; rework minimized.

### 3) Procurement & Supply Chain
- 1 — Initial: Procurement reactive; lead times unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Procurement plan and vendor strategy; lead time tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Supply chain risks are managed proactively; alternates planned.

### 4) Construction & Commissioning
- 1 — Initial: Plans ad-hoc; commissioning unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Construction plan and commissioning checklist.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is reliable; commissioning is repeatable and efficient.

### 5) Operations & Monitoring
- 1 — Initial: Monitoring missing; performance issues go undetected.
- 3 — Defined: Ops model and monitoring plan; KPIs defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are mature; performance optimized continuously.

### 6) Governance & Risk
- 1 — Initial: Risks undocumented; reporting inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Risk register and reporting cadence; owners defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance is disciplined; risks are managed and learned from.

## Deliverables
- Implementation readiness scorecard
- Permitting and scope plan
- Design review and interface spec
- Procurement and supply chain plan
- Commissioning and operations plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROJECT]: Project name
- [TECH]: Technology
- [PERMITS]: Permits
- [VENDORS]: Vendors
- [COMMISSIONING]: Commissioning plan
- [KPIS]: KPIs

## Example (Condensed)
- Project: 100MW solar farm
- Scores (1–5): Scope 3; Design 2; Procurement 2; Construction 3; Ops 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Finalize design standards; de-risk procurement; formalize monitoring and ops model
