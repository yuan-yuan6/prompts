# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to draft a contract across six dimensions: Deal Context & Scope, Parties & Authority, Commercial Terms, Risk Allocation, Compliance & Regulatory, and Execution & Lifecycle. Identify gaps and produce a drafting package that reduces negotiation churn.

## Template

Conduct a contract drafting readiness assessment for {CONTRACT_TYPE} between {PARTY_A} and {PARTY_B} under {GOVERNING_LAW}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. DEAL CONTEXT & SCOPE READINESS**
- Purpose and business outcomes are defined
- Scope/deliverables and acceptance criteria are clear
- Assumptions, dependencies, and exclusions are explicit
- Timeline and milestones are realistic
- Success metrics and service levels are defined (if applicable)

**2. PARTIES & AUTHORITY READINESS**
- Correct legal entities are identified (including affiliates)
- Signatory authority is confirmed
- Notices/contact details are defined
- Use of subcontractors/third parties is clarified
- Required approvals are known (procurement, security, privacy)

**3. COMMERCIAL TERMS READINESS**
- Pricing model is defined (fixed, usage, milestones)
- Payment terms are defined (timing, invoicing, taxes)
- Term and renewal structure is defined
- Service credits/penalties are defined (if relevant)
- Change orders and rate cards are defined (if relevant)

**4. RISK ALLOCATION READINESS**
- Limitation of liability approach is defined and consistent
- Indemnities are aligned (IP, third-party claims, data incidents)
- Warranties and disclaimers match the product/service reality
- Insurance requirements are practical and verifiable
- IP ownership/licensing and confidentiality positions are clear

**5. COMPLIANCE & REGULATORY READINESS**
- Privacy/security requirements are captured (data types, processing, controls)
- Sector-specific requirements are identified (e.g., healthcare, finance)
- Export/sanctions and anti-corruption expectations are captured where relevant
- Recordkeeping/audit rights are clarified
- Third-party/vendor obligations and flow-down clauses are defined

**6. EXECUTION & LIFECYCLE READINESS**
- Required exhibits/schedules are identified (SOW, DPA, security addendum)
- Execution method is defined (wet/e-sign, counterparts)
- Amendment/change control process is defined
- Termination rights and transition obligations are workable
- Contract ownership for ongoing management is defined

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 drafting blockers
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **DRAFTING CHECKLIST** - Inputs required before first full draft
4. **OPEN ISSUES LIST** - Issues, owners, and required decisions
5. **FALLBACK POSITIONS** - Negotiation fallbacks aligned to risk tolerance
6. **SIGNATURE PACKAGE** - Execution steps, approvals, and final exhibits list

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (missing basics; high risk of churn)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some inputs exist; key positions unclear)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (most inputs/positions clear; manageable negotiation)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (repeatable playbooks and fast approvals)
- 5.0: Optimized (standardized terms with predictable cycle time)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "SaaS MSA + DPA" |
| `[PARTY_A]` | Party A | "Customer" |
| `[PARTY_B]` | Party B | "Vendor" |
| `[PURPOSE]` | Business purpose | "Customer support platform" |
| `[GOVERNING_LAW]` | Governing law | "Delaware" |

## Example

**SaaS Contract - Drafting Readiness**

> Assess contract drafting readiness for **SaaS MSA + DPA** between **Customer** and **Vendor** for **customer support platform** under **Delaware** law. Scope is mostly clear but acceptance criteria and data processing details are incomplete; signatory authority and affiliate coverage are unclear; commercial terms are agreed but renewal and change-order mechanics are missing; liability cap and IP indemnity positions are not aligned; privacy/security requirements need a DPA and security exhibit; execution requires procurement and security approvals. Provide a scorecard and a drafting checklist with owners for open issues.
