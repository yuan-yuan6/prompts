# Recruitment Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run an end-to-end recruitment process with clear roles, predictable throughput, fair candidate experience, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess recruitment readiness for [ORGANIZATION] hiring [HEADCOUNT] roles/quarter. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Workforce planning & intake, (2) Sourcing & pipeline, (3) Screening & assessment, (4) Process operations & tooling, (5) Stakeholder alignment, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Workforce Planning & Intake
- 1 — Initial: Intake is ad-hoc; priorities unclear; roles change frequently.
- 3 — Defined: Intake process; success profiles; hiring plan and approvals.
- 5 — Optimized: Planning is proactive; intake is fast; prioritization is consistent.

### 2) Sourcing & Pipeline
- 1 — Initial: Pipeline inconsistent; channels unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Sourcing strategy by role; pipeline stages defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Pipeline is predictable; channel performance is optimized.

### 3) Screening & Assessment
- 1 — Initial: Screening varies by recruiter; assessments unstructured.
- 3 — Defined: Structured screening and assessments aligned to competencies.
- 5 — Optimized: Assessments are calibrated and predictive; candidate experience is strong.

### 4) Process Operations & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Scheduling and handoffs are manual; delays common.
- 3 — Defined: ATS workflows; SLAs; standardized templates and communication.
- 5 — Optimized: Automation reduces cycle time; operations scale reliably.

### 5) Stakeholder Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Hiring managers disagree on criteria; feedback slow.
- 3 — Defined: Roles, decision rights, and debrief process; feedback cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Alignment is tight; decisions are fast; accountability is clear.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: KPIs inconsistent; little learning from outcomes.
- 3 — Defined: Metrics defined; dashboards; retrospectives.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves quality, speed, and equity.

## Deliverables
- Recruitment readiness scorecard and gap list
- End-to-end process map with SLAs
- Standard interview plan and communication templates
- ATS workflow and reporting requirements
- 90-day improvement plan with KPI targets

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [HEADCOUNT]: Hiring volume
- [ROLE_FAMILY]: Role family
- [ATS]: ATS platform
- [SLA_DAYS]: SLA targets (screening, feedback)
- [QUALITY_OF_HIRE]: Definition

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Rapidly growing team with long time-to-hire
- Scores (1–5): Intake 2; Pipeline 2; Screening 2; Ops 3; Alignment 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize intake + profiles; implement SLAs; add calibration and KPI cadence
