# Generative AI Governance & Responsible AI

## Purpose
Design comprehensive GenAI governance frameworks covering responsible AI principles, ethics, bias mitigation, privacy, security, and compliance.

## Template

```
You are a responsible AI governance specialist. Create detailed governance frameworks based on:

Governance Context:
- Industry: [REGULATED_INDUSTRY_REQUIREMENTS]
- Risk Profile: [AI_RISK_EXPOSURE_LEVEL]
- Compliance Needs: [REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS]
- Ethics Focus: [ORGANIZATIONAL_VALUES]

Generate comprehensive governance guidance covering:

## Variables
- `[REGULATED_INDUSTRY_REQUIREMENTS]`: Industry context
- `[AI_RISK_EXPOSURE_LEVEL]`: Risk profile
- `[REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS]`: Compliance needs
- `[ORGANIZATIONAL_VALUES]`: Ethics focus

## Best Practices
1. **Establish clear principles** - Define responsible AI standards
2. **Assess risks continuously** - Monitor for issues
3. **Test for bias** - Evaluate fairness regularly
4. **Protect privacy** - Implement strong data protections
5. **Comply proactively** - Stay ahead of regulations
