# Business Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether an organization is ready to produce a coherent business plan that is credible, internally aligned, and actionable. This focuses on evidence quality, financial realism, and the operating plan required to execute.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess business planning readiness for [ORGANIZATION] pursuing [STRATEGIC_GOAL] in [INDUSTRY] and [TARGET_MARKET]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategic narrative & differentiation, (2) Market and customer evidence, (3) Operating plan & execution readiness, (4) Financial model & unit economics, (5) Risks & assumptions management, (6) Governance & stakeholder alignment. Provide a scorecard, key gaps, and a 60–90 day plan to strengthen the plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategic Narrative & Differentiation
- 1 — Initial: Vision and positioning are generic; priorities are unclear; value proposition is not testable.
- 3 — Defined: Clear narrative, priorities, and differentiation; strategy ties to specific outcomes.
- 5 — Optimized: Narrative is crisp and evidence-backed; tradeoffs are explicit; stakeholders use it to make consistent decisions.

### 2) Market and Customer Evidence
- 1 — Initial: Market claims are unreferenced; customer needs are assumed; competitor view is superficial.
- 3 — Defined: Customer segments and problems are validated; market sizing assumptions are documented; competitor analysis is credible.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous customer insight; measurable market signals; segment economics and competitive dynamics inform choices.

### 3) Operating Plan & Execution Readiness
- 1 — Initial: Roadmap is aspirational; owners are unclear; dependencies and capacity are not planned.
- 3 — Defined: Roadmap has milestones, owners, and dependencies; resourcing plan exists; execution risks are identified.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model supports delivery; cross-functional routines drive execution; plans are updated based on learning.

### 4) Financial Model & Unit Economics
- 1 — Initial: Numbers are top-down only; drivers are unclear; sensitivity is missing.
- 3 — Defined: Driver-based model; scenario analysis exists; unit economics and cash needs are explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Model is auditable and linked to operational drivers; assumptions are governed; forecasting improves with feedback.

### 5) Risks & Assumptions Management
- 1 — Initial: Risks are listed but not owned; assumptions are implicit.
- 3 — Defined: Key assumptions are documented; risks have owners and mitigation plans; triggers are defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Assumptions are tested systematically; mitigation is tracked; decision gates incorporate risk and evidence.

### 6) Governance & Stakeholder Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Stakeholders disagree on priorities; approvals are slow; decision rights are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights and review cadence exist; alignment is explicit; escalation paths are defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance accelerates decisions; alignment persists through execution; accountability is clear.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Gap list with recommended improvements
- Business plan outline with required evidence per section
- 60–90 day plan to strengthen narrative, evidence, and model
- Success metrics (alignment, time-to-decision, forecast accuracy)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Target market definition
- [STRATEGIC_GOAL]: Goal (fundraising, new launch, annual plan)
- [REVENUE_MODEL]: Revenue model (subscription, transaction, services)
- [KEY_ASSUMPTIONS]: Top assumptions to validate

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Startup preparing seed round and 12-month operating plan
- Scores (1–5): Narrative 3; Market Evidence 2; Operating Plan 2; Financial Model 2; Risks 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Weak customer evidence, missing driver-based model, unclear resourcing and dependencies
- 60–90 day priorities: Validate segment pain points; build driver model + scenarios; define roadmap owners, milestones, and capacity plan
