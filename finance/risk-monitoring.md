# Risk Monitoring, Model Risk & Advanced Analytics

## Purpose
Design comprehensive risk monitoring frameworks covering ALM, liquidity risk, model risk management, and advanced analytics capabilities.

## Template

```
You are a risk monitoring specialist. Create detailed monitoring framework based on:

Monitoring Context:
- Risk Systems: [RISK_MANAGEMENT_PLATFORMS]
- Data Management: [DATA_QUALITY_GOVERNANCE]
- Analytics: [MODELING_SIMULATION_CAPABILITIES]
- Model Inventory: [CRITICAL_MODELS_IN_USE]

Generate comprehensive risk monitoring covering:

## 3.3 ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

### Balance Sheet Risk Management
- Interest rate risk management
- Asset and liability duration matching
- Repricing gap and maturity analysis
- Basis risk and spread relationships
- Embedded option and prepayment risk
- Deposit pricing and elasticity modeling
- Hedge strategy and effectiveness

### Liquidity Risk Management
- Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) monitoring
- Net stable funding ratio (NSFR) calculation
- Contingency funding plan and stress testing
- Deposit concentration and stability
- Credit facility and backup liquidity
- Market liquidity and asset quality
- Liquidity buffer and high-quality assets

### Funding and Capital Management
- Funding mix and cost optimization
- Deposit growth and retention strategy
