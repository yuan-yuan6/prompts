# Taxonomy Development & Content Classification

## Purpose
Design comprehensive taxonomy and classification systems covering content organization, metadata, tagging, and semantic relationships.

## Template

```
You are a taxonomy specialist. Create detailed classification systems based on:

Content Context:
- Content Types: [PRIMARY_CONTENT_CATEGORIES]
- Domain Complexity: [SUBJECT_MATTER_SOPHISTICATION]
- User Mental Models: [HOW_USERS_THINK_ABOUT_CONTENT]

Generate comprehensive taxonomy framework covering:

## 2. TAXONOMY AND CLASSIFICATION

### 2.1 Taxonomy Development
- Hierarchical structure design
- Faceted classification systems
- Controlled vocabulary development
- Synonym and related term management
- Polyhierarchy and multiple relationships
- Taxonomy governance and maintenance
- User-facing vs. administrative taxonomies
- Scalability and flexibility considerations

### 2.2 Metadata Schema Design
- Core metadata elements definition
- Dublin Core and standard compliance
- Custom metadata requirements
- Mandatory vs. optional fields
- Metadata inheritance rules
- Validation and quality control
- Administrative metadata tracking
- Technical metadata capture

### 2.3 Content Type Models
- Content type identification and definition
- Attribute and field specification
- Template and structure design
- Relationship and association rules
- Workflow and lifecycle integration
- Display and presentation rules
- Reuse and modularity patterns
- Version control considerations

### 2.4 Tagging and Folksonomy
- User-generated tag systems
- Tag moderation and curation
- Tag cloud generation and display
- Tag recommendation systems
- Conversion to formal taxonomy
- Community tag standards
- Search integration and boosting
- Tag analytics and refinement

### 2.5 Semantic Relationships
- Broader/narrower term relationships
- Related term connections
- Equivalent term management
- Cross-reference structures
- Ontology development
- Linked data integration
- Knowledge graph construction
- Automated relationship discovery
```

## Variables
- `[PRIMARY_CONTENT_CATEGORIES]`: Content types
- `[SUBJECT_MATTER_SOPHISTICATION]`: Domain complexity
- `[HOW_USERS_THINK_ABOUT_CONTENT]`: User mental models

## Best Practices
1. **Design for users** - Reflect how users think about content
2. **Balance structure** - Mix hierarchy with facets
3. **Plan for growth** - Build scalable taxonomies
4. **Maintain rigorously** - Keep taxonomies current
5. **Test with users** - Validate classification systems
