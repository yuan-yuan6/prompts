# Social Activities Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build and sustain a healthier social life across six dimensions: intent, opportunity discovery, logistics, social confidence, follow-up, and boundaries. This framework identifies gaps and produces a practical 30-day plan.

## Template

Conduct a social activities readiness assessment for {PROFILE} pursuing {SOCIAL_GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) INTENT & FIT**
- Clarity on what connection means (friends, community, dating, professional)
- Alignment between goals and preferred settings (1:1, small group, large events, online-first)
- Realistic expectations (time-to-connection, rejection/ghosting tolerance)

**2) OPPORTUNITY DISCOVERY**
- Ability to identify viable places to meet people (recurring groups > one-offs)
- Quality of options (proximity, cost, schedule, values, vibe)
- Willingness to try multiple channels (classes, volunteering, clubs, friends-of-friends)

**3) LOGISTICS & COMMITMENT**
- Calendar capacity and energy management (workload, recovery time)
- Transportation, budget, accessibility constraints
- Systems that reduce friction (recurrence, reminders, default plans)

**4) SOCIAL CONFIDENCE & SKILLS**
- Comfort initiating conversation and joining groups
- Fundamentals (open questions, self-disclosure balance, active listening)
- Anxiety management via micro-goals (2 intros, 1 follow-up, exit plan)

**5) FOLLOW-UP & RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**
- Follow-up speed and consistency (24–72 hours)
- Ability to propose a next step (repeat event, coffee, walk, shared activity)
- Maintenance habits (light touches, invitations, remembering details)

**6) BOUNDARIES & WELLBEING**
- Healthy boundaries (time, money, emotional labor)
- Safety practices (public-first meetings, trust signals, exits)
- Sustainability (avoid burnout; choose activities you enjoy)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 30 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary constraint

3) **ACTIVITY FIT & FEASIBILITY**
- 8–12 candidate activities or group types
- For each: feasibility (High/Med/Low), why it fits, smallest next step

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **30-DAY PLAN**
- Weekly cadence (Week 1–4)
- Specific actions: discovery, outreach, attendance, follow-up
- 2 outreach scripts + 2 follow-up scripts

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30-day targets for: outreach attempts, events attended, follow-ups sent, 1:1 meetups, repeat attendance, wellbeing

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal consistency)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some attempts, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, occasional friction)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (consistent routines, improving quality)
- 5.0: Optimized (strong community flywheel, sustainable and fulfilling)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {PROFILE} | Who you are and your social style | “Introverted remote worker new to the city, prefers small groups” |
| {SOCIAL_GOALS} | What you want from your social life | “Make 2 close friends + find weekend activity partners” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “$50/week, Tue/Thu evenings only, social anxiety 6/10” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {PROFILE}: Introverted remote worker, 29, moved to Seattle 3 months ago, prefers small groups and structured activities
- {SOCIAL_GOALS}: Make 2 new friends and find 1 consistent weekend activity group
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Tue/Thu evenings + one weekend block; budget $40/week; social anxiety (6/10); no car

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.1/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities (30 days): (1) pick 2 recurring anchors, (2) send 2 invites/week, (3) follow up within 48 hours

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary constraint |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Intent & Fit | 4.0 | Clear preference for small groups + structure | Avoids unstructured parties |
| Opportunity Discovery | 3.0 | Uses Meetup but inconsistent screening | Too many options | 
| Logistics & Commitment | 3.0 | Stable windows Tue/Thu + weekend | No car limits locations |
| Social Confidence & Skills | 2.5 | Anxiety spikes at first contact | Avoidance after awkward moments |
| Follow-up & Relationship Building | 2.0 | Rarely proposes a second hang | Uncertainty about “pushing” |
| Boundaries & Wellbeing | 4.0 | Good self-care awareness | Over-committing risk |

3) **ACTIVITY FIT & FEASIBILITY**
- Beginner climbing class (High): structured, repeatable; next step: book intro class near light rail
- Board game café weekly night (High): conversation anchors; next step: attend and introduce yourself to 2 people
- Volunteer trail cleanup (Med): values-aligned; next step: register for one Saturday event
- Language exchange (Med): predictable format; next step: attend and ask one person to pair again next week
- Big nightlife party (Low): mismatched preference; next step: skip

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Attendance doesn’t convert → no follow-up habit → use scripts + schedule next step before leaving
- Gap 2: Option overload → missing screening rubric → commit to 2 anchors for 30 days; ignore the rest
- Gap 3: Approach anxiety → goals too large → micro-goal: 2 intros + 1 follow-up, then leave
- Gap 4: Transit friction → poor location filtering → choose only stations-within-10-min venues
- Gap 5: Fear of being “annoying” → unclear consent signals → ask explicitly and offer an easy out

5) **30-DAY PLAN**
- Week 1: choose 2 anchors; attend 1; send 2 invites; follow up within 48 hours
- Week 2: attend both anchors; ask 1 person to repeat; schedule 1 low-stakes 1:1 (coffee/walk)
- Week 3: repeat attendance; invite 1 person to join you; keep touches light
- Week 4: keep the best anchor; add 1 new option only if stable

Scripts:
- Outreach #1: “Hey—are you going to next week’s session? I’m planning to go and would love to say hi.”
- Outreach #2: “I’m checking out [event] on [day]. Want to join? Totally fine if not.”
- Follow-up #1: “Great meeting you at [event]. Want to do the next one together?”
- Follow-up #2: “I enjoyed chatting about [topic]. Want to grab coffee near [station] this week?”

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Outreach attempts: 0 → 8
- Events attended: 1/month → 6/month
- Follow-ups sent: 10% → 80% within 48 hours
- 1:1 meetups: 0 → 2
- Repeat attendance: 0 → 4 repeats
- Wellbeing (self-rated): 5/10 → 6.5/10

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Prefer recurring groups over one-offs** — repeated exposure builds trust faster.
2) **Use a two-anchor strategy** — commit to two weekly/biweekly activities for 30 days.
3) **Set micro-goals for each event** — e.g., 2 introductions + 1 follow-up.
4) **Follow up within 24–72 hours** — momentum matters more than perfect wording.
5) **Make the next step specific and easy** — propose time/place/activity with an opt-out.
6) **Track consistency, not charisma** — measure attendance and follow-up, not “how smooth it felt.”
7) **Protect energy with boundaries** — schedule recovery time and cap over-commitment.
8) **Review and prune monthly** — keep what energizes you; drop what drains you.
