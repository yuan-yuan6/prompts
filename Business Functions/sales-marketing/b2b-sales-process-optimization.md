# B2B Sales Process & Revenue Operations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to optimize a B2B sales process end-to-end, including qualification, opportunity progression, forecasting, tech stack, and RevOps governance.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess B2B sales process readiness for [COMPANY_TYPE] with [SALES_TEAM_SIZE] reps, avg deal size [DEAL_SIZE], and sales cycle [SALES_CYCLE] days. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) ICP & qualification, (2) Process stages & enablement, (3) Pipeline management & forecasting, (4) Tech stack & data, (5) RevOps operating model, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) ICP & Qualification
- 1 — Initial: ICP unclear; qualification inconsistent; low quality pipeline.
- 3 — Defined: ICP and personas; qualification framework; disqualifiers and thresholds.
- 5 — Optimized: ICP refined by outcomes; qualification is consistent; pipeline quality improves predictably.

### 2) Process Stages & Enablement
- 1 — Initial: Stages are vague; exit criteria unclear; enablement is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Stages and exit criteria; standard activities; enablement materials exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Process is coached and audited; enablement supports repeatable execution.

### 3) Pipeline Management & Forecasting
- 1 — Initial: Forecasting is subjective; pipeline hygiene weak; coverage unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Stage conversion benchmarks; pipeline review cadence; forecast method documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Forecast accuracy improves; leading indicators drive interventions; coverage targets are maintained.

### 4) Tech Stack & Data
- 1 — Initial: CRM data incomplete; workflows manual; reporting unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: CRM fields and workflows standardized; key integrations; dashboards exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Data quality monitored; automation reduces admin; analytics support decision-making.

### 5) RevOps Operating Model
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; changes ad-hoc; governance slow.
- 3 — Defined: RevOps roles and decision rights; change management; SLA governance.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales; governance enables speed; process improvements compound.

### 6) Measurement & Continuous Improvement
- 1 — Initial: Metrics inconsistent; no improvement loop.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework; cadence; action tracking; basic experimentation.
- 5 — Optimized: Improvement program; root-cause analysis; coaching and ops changes drive measurable gains.

## Deliverables
- Sales process readiness scorecard with top gaps
- Stage definitions with exit criteria and conversion benchmarks
- Qualification framework and routing/SLAs
- CRM workflow and data standards
- Forecasting method and pipeline operating cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [COMPANY_TYPE]: Organization type
- [SALES_TEAM_SIZE]: Number of sales reps
- [DEAL_SIZE]: Average deal size
- [SALES_CYCLE]: Average sales cycle length
- [CRM_PLATFORM]: CRM platform
- [WIN_RATE_TARGET]: Target win rate

## Example (Condensed)
- Company: Mid-market SaaS scaling sales team
- Scores (1–5): ICP 3; Process 2; Forecasting 2; Tech/Data 2; RevOps 3; Improvement 2
- Top gaps: Vague exit criteria; unreliable CRM data; inconsistent pipeline reviews
- 90-day priorities: Standardize stages + exit criteria; fix CRM data standards; implement weekly pipeline cadence and forecast method
