# Job Analysis & Role Definition Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to define roles clearly using job analysis that supports hiring, performance management, compensation, and workforce planning.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess job analysis readiness for [ROLE_FAMILY] across [ROLE_COUNT] roles. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Role purpose & outcomes, (2) Competencies & skills, (3) Responsibilities & scope, (4) Leveling & career paths, (5) Documentation & governance, (6) Adoption & maintenance. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Role Purpose & Outcomes
- 1 — Initial: Role purpose unclear; success measures missing.
- 3 — Defined: Role outcomes and responsibilities documented; success metrics defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Role definitions are outcome-based and consistently used across processes.

### 2) Competencies & Skills
- 1 — Initial: Skills requirements are vague or inflated.
- 3 — Defined: Competencies and skills mapped to role outcomes.
- 5 — Optimized: Competency models are validated and updated as work evolves.

### 3) Responsibilities & Scope
- 1 — Initial: Overlap and ambiguity between roles; scope creep common.
- 3 — Defined: Clear responsibilities and boundaries; interfaces defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scopes are well-managed; handoffs are smooth and measurable.

### 4) Leveling & Career Paths
- 1 — Initial: Levels unclear; career progression inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Leveling criteria and career ladders documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Leveling is applied consistently; mobility and development improve.

### 5) Documentation & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Docs scattered; updates uncontrolled.
- 3 — Defined: Single source of truth; owners and change process.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance keeps definitions current while enabling speed.

### 6) Adoption & Maintenance
- 1 — Initial: Definitions aren’t used; quickly become stale.
- 3 — Defined: Usage in hiring/performance/comp; review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Definitions are maintained continuously and drive consistent decisions.

## Deliverables
- Role definition readiness scorecard and gap list
- Role templates (purpose, responsibilities, outcomes)
- Competency and skills mapping
- Leveling criteria and career ladder
- Governance and review cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ROLE_FAMILY]: Role family
- [ROLE_COUNT]: Number of roles
- [COMPETENCY_MODEL]: Competency model
- [LEVELS]: Level count
- [OWNERS]: Role owners
- [REVIEW_CADENCE]: Review cadence

## Example (Condensed)
- Role family: Customer Success with inconsistent titles and expectations
- Scores (1–5): Purpose 2; Skills 2; Scope 2; Leveling 2; Governance 3; Adoption 2
- 60-day priorities: Create role templates; define leveling; set single source of truth and review cadence
