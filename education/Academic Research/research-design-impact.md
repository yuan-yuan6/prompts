Use mixed-methods evaluation with surveys, case studies, and longitudinal tracking. Measure economic impact (ROI), social impact (community capacity), environmental impact (carbon reduction)."

## Best Practices

1. **Plan dissemination from the beginning** - Don't wait until results are ready; start building relationships early
2. **Tailor messages to each audience** - Academics, practitioners, and public need different communication approaches
3. **Use multiple dissemination channels** - Combine traditional publications with social media, policy briefs, and community presentations
4. **Measure impact systematically** - Track not just outputs (publications) but outcomes (citations, policy changes, practice adoption)
5. **Invest in knowledge translation** - Allocate resources to bridge research-practice gap with implementation tools
6. **Embrace methodological innovation thoughtfully** - Use new methods when they genuinely improve research, not just for novelty
7. **Build sustainable partnerships** - Create long-term relationships with stakeholders beyond single projects
8. **Document lessons learned** - Capture what works and what doesn't for continuous improvement
9. **Plan for research sustainability** - Develop capacity and systems that outlast individual projects
10. **Think globally, act locally** - Consider international relevance while adapting to local contexts

## Tips for Success

- Create a dissemination timeline that starts before data collection ends
- Develop relationships with journalists and science communicators in your field
- Use plain language summaries alongside technical reports
- Build an online presence (website, social media) to share research updates
- Present at practitioner conferences, not just academic meetings
- Create visual abstracts and infographics that explain key findings simply
- Engage stakeholders in interpreting findings and developing recommendations
- Archive data and materials in open repositories for maximum accessibility
- Track dissemination metrics (downloads, citations, media mentions, policy citations)
- Invest time in learning new technologies that could enhance your research

## Customization Options

1. **Audience Emphasis**: Customize dissemination strategies for academic-focused (publications, conferences), practice-focused (training, toolkits), policy-focused (briefs, testimony), or public-focused (media, community events) research

2. **Innovation Level**: Scale from incremental improvements to existing methods to radical methodological innovations requiring substantial technology investment and method development

3. **Impact Scope**: Adapt for local community impact, regional or national policy influence, or international/global research contributions with appropriate dissemination and evaluation approaches

4. **Technology Integration Depth**: Range from basic digital tools to advanced AI/ML systems, big data analytics, or cutting-edge computational methods based on research needs and resources

5. **Sustainability Focus**: Customize for short-term project completion versus long-term program building with appropriate capacity development, infrastructure investment, and institutional partnerships
