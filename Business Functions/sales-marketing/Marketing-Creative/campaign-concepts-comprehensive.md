# Comprehensive Campaign Concepts Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to develop integrated campaign concepts that scale across channels, maintain creative coherence, and support measurable performance optimization.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess comprehensive campaign concept readiness for [CAMPAIGN_NAME] for [BRAND_CLIENT] targeting [TARGET_MARKET] with objective [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE] over [CAMPAIGN_DURATION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategy & objectives, (2) Audience insight & cultural context, (3) Big idea & message architecture, (4) Integrated activation & content plan, (5) Production operating model & governance, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategy & Objectives
- 1 — Initial: Objectives and success metrics are vague; concept is not tied to outcomes.
- 3 — Defined: Objective, audience, offer, and KPI targets are clear; constraints and tradeoffs are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy aligns budget, channel mix, and creative; decisions are fast; outcomes are monitored.

### 2) Audience Insight & Cultural Context
- 1 — Initial: Minimal research; insight is assumed; cultural nuance is ignored.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and segments documented; tensions and objections mapped; insights inform the big idea.
- 5 — Optimized: Insight pipeline exists; creative analytics inform updates; localization is intentional and governed.

### 3) Big Idea & Message Architecture
- 1 — Initial: Generic theme; inconsistent messaging; no clear proof/CTA system.
- 3 — Defined: Big idea, pillars, proof points, and CTA conventions; clear creative brief.
- 5 — Optimized: Message system scales across channels and stages; personalization rules are clear; brand coherence is maintained.

### 4) Integrated Activation & Content Plan
- 1 — Initial: Channel plan is a list; sequencing is unclear; asset needs are underestimated.
- 3 — Defined: Activation maps to funnel stages; content plan and cadence are feasible; dependencies tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Orchestrated execution across touchpoints; reuse and modularity reduce effort; optimization loops are fast.

### 5) Production Operating Model & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Roles unclear; approvals slow; rework is frequent.
- 3 — Defined: Production plan, owners, timelines, and review workflow; partner management is explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Predictable throughput with SLAs; governance ensures coherence; teams are enabled to self-serve.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Tracking and attribution are unclear; optimization is reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Measurement plan and KPI definitions; testing cadence; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program with creative analytics; attribution assumptions explicit; insights drive iteration.

## Deliverables
- Integrated readiness scorecard with top gaps
- Campaign concept brief (strategy, audience, big idea, pillars, proof, CTA)
- Activation plan (funnel mapping, channels, sequencing, cadence)
- Asset inventory (formats, specs, owners, timelines)
- Measurement and testing plan (KPIs, hypotheses, cadence)
- 90-day improvement roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [CAMPAIGN_NAME]: Campaign name
- [BRAND_CLIENT]: Brand or client
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Primary audience/segment
- [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE]: Awareness, acquisition, retention, reactivation
- [CAMPAIGN_DURATION]: Duration and milestones
- [CHANNEL_MIX]: Channels and key placements
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: KPI targets and measurement approach

## Example (Condensed)
- Campaign: Global product launch for a consumer electronics brand
- Channels: Paid social + search + PR + influencer + retail
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Insight 2; Big Idea 3; Activation 2; Operating Model 3; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Weak insight pipeline; unclear sequencing; limited learnings capture
- 90-day priorities: Establish insights + analytics loop; define sequencing and asset inventory; set weekly optimization cadence
