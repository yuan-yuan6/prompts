# Metaverse & Extended Reality (XR) Strategy Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for developing metaverse and XR strategies including virtual world development, immersive experiences, digital twin integration, virtual economy design, and enterprise XR implementation.

## Quick Metaverse/XR Prompt
Design [VR/AR/MR] experience for [use case: training/collaboration/commerce/entertainment]. Platform: [Unity/Unreal] with [Quest/HoloLens/Vision Pro]. Capacity: [X concurrent users]. Performance: 90fps minimum, <[Y]ms latency. Features: avatar system, social interactions, [spatial audio/haptics]. Economy: [subscription/NFT/virtual goods]. Infrastructure: [AWS Gamelift/Azure PlayFab] for state management. Analytics: user engagement, session duration, conversion.

## Quick Start

**Set Your Foundation:**
1. Define XR focus area: VR (immersive), AR (overlay), or MR (mixed reality)
2. Set target user base and concurrent user capacity
3. Identify primary use case: training, collaboration, commerce, entertainment, or digital twins

**Configure Key Parameters:**
4. Select platform stack: Unity/Unreal Engine for 3D, Meta Quest/HoloLens for hardware
5. Define graphics quality targets and performance metrics (90fps minimum for VR comfort)
6. Set monetization model: subscription, NFT sales, virtual real estate, or transaction fees

**Implement & Deploy (Ongoing):**
7. Build MVP with basic avatar system and social features using ready-made SDKs
8. Deploy cloud infrastructure for rendering and state management (AWS Gamelift or Azure PlayFab)
9. Implement user onboarding with comfort settings and accessibility features
10. Test with beta users for motion sickness, usability, and engagement metrics

**Pro Tips:** Start with WebXR for broad accessibility, prioritize comfort over visual fidelity, design for 5-10 minute sessions initially, and use spatial audio for immersion. Consider Meta Quest 3 for consumer VR and HoloLens 2 for enterprise AR.

## Template

Develop metaverse/XR strategy for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] targeting [USER_BASE] users, with [EXPERIENCE_COUNT] immersive experiences, [PLATFORM_TARGETS] platforms, achieving [ENGAGEMENT_TARGET] engagement rate, [REVENUE_MODEL] monetization, and [ROI_TARGET] ROI.
