# Regulatory Compliance Readiness Assessment - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
Use this overview to pick the right compliance readiness assessment and run them in the right order. The full set is split into three parts:

- **Part 1: Foundation & Governance** - Oversight, policy lifecycle, roles/resourcing, culture/training, baseline risk register, and evidence basics.
- **Part 2: Risk Management & Monitoring** - Risk taxonomy, monitoring/surveillance, KRIs/alerts, regulatory change management, training effectiveness, escalation.
- **Part 3: Implementation & Reporting** - Audits/testing, issues & CAPA, regulator engagement, dashboards/metrics, program delivery governance, continuous improvement.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> For **[ORGANIZATION]** in **[INDUSTRY]** operating across **[JURISDICTIONS]** under **[CORE_REGULATIONS]**, choose the best starting assessment: (1) If governance, ownership, policy control, and evidence are unclear, start with **Part 1**. (2) If governance exists but monitoring, investigations, KRIs, and regulatory change handling are inconsistent, start with **Part 2**. (3) If monitoring exists but audit/CAPA discipline, exam readiness, and performance reporting are weak, start with **Part 3**. Provide: the chosen starting part, a sequenced order for the remaining parts, and the minimum inputs needed (org chart/committees, policy inventory, risk register, monitoring coverage, audit/CAPA log).

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Use this decision guide for {ORGANIZATION}:

**A. Choose the starting point**

- Start with **Part 1** if any of these are true:
  - No clear three-lines-of-defense model or decision rights for exceptions
  - Policies/procedures exist but have no controlled lifecycle (review/approval/versioning)
  - Roles/resourcing are unclear (no SMEs, no control owners, no accountable approvals)
  - Evidence is scattered (training attestations, approvals, exceptions, control evidence)

- Start with **Part 2** if any of these are true:
  - Risk taxonomy exists, but monitoring coverage and investigations are inconsistent
  - Alerts are noisy and not tied to playbooks or escalation triggers
  - Regulatory change is managed ad-hoc (emails/spreadsheets without evidence)

- Start with **Part 3** if any of these are true:
  - Audits/testing lack repeatable procedures and evidence standards
  - CAPA closure is weak (no validation, recurrence tracking, or escalation)
  - Exam response is slow due to unclear owners and evidence retrieval problems

**B. Define scope**
- Jurisdictions: {JURISDICTIONS}
- Core regulations/obligations: {CORE_REGULATIONS}
- Business processes/products in scope: {IN_SCOPE_PROCESSES}
- Third parties in scope (if relevant): {IN_SCOPE_THIRD_PARTIES}

**C. Run the assessments**
- Run the selected part first and capture the scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.
- Run the remaining parts in sequence to produce a complete end-to-end roadmap.

Deliver your navigation output as:

1. **STARTING PART** - Which part and why
2. **SEQUENCE** - Recommended order for the remaining parts
3. **MINIMUM INPUTS** - Documents/data needed to run the assessments quickly
4. **STAKEHOLDERS** - Owners needed (compliance, legal, risk, audit, operations, IT)
5. **OUTPUT PACKAGE** - Scorecards + combined 90-day plan themes

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc program, limited accountability, weak evidence)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic components exist, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable governance/monitoring/audit processes)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured effectiveness, strong evidence discipline)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive risk management, continuous improvement)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "B2B Payments Company" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "FinTech" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US + EU" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "AML, privacy, consumer protection" |
| `[IN_SCOPE_PROCESSES]` | Processes/products in scope | "Onboarding, underwriting, payouts" |
| `[IN_SCOPE_THIRD_PARTIES]` | Vendors/partners in scope | "KYC provider, cloud hosting" |

## Example

**Choosing where to start**

> For **B2B Payments Company** in **FinTech** across **US + EU** under **AML, privacy, consumer protection**, start with **Part 2** because KRIs exist but thresholds are not tuned, investigations lack audit trails, and regulatory change handling is email-based. Then run **Part 3** to harden CAPA and exam readiness, and finish with **Part 1** to formalize decision rights and evidence standards.
