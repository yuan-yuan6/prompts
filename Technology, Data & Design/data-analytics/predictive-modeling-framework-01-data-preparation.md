# Predictive Modeling Framework Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive predictive modeling strategies covering regression analysis, classification algorithms, time series forecasting, ensemble methods, and AutoML implementation to enable data-driven decision making through accurate predictions, pattern recognition, and automated machine learning workflows.

## Quick Start

Build predictive models in 4 steps:

1. **Define Business Problem**: Specify your use case (e.g., "customer churn prediction for e-commerce with 10M customers, binary classification, 100+ features, daily updates, cloud deployment, 85% recall target").

2. **Prepare Data Pipeline**: Collect data from sources, assess quality (completeness, accuracy), handle missing values (imputation), encode categorical variables (one-hot, target encoding), engineer features (lags, interactions, aggregations), and split data (time-based or stratified).

3. **Select and Train Models**: Choose algorithms - Linear/Logistic Regression (interpretable), Random Forest/XGBoost (accurate), Neural Networks (complex patterns), or AutoML (automated). Configure hyperparameters, train with cross-validation, evaluate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC).

4. **Deploy and Monitor**: Build API endpoints, integrate with production systems, implement A/B testing, monitor performance metrics, detect data drift, set up retraining triggers, and track business impact (ROI, cost savings).
