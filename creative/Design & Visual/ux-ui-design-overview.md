# UX/UI Design - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This overview guide helps you navigate the UX/UI design prompt collection and select the appropriate template for your specific design deliverable needs.

## Quick Start

**Want to design user interfaces quickly?** Here's how to choose the right template:

### When to Use This Overview
- Starting a new UI/UX design project
- Need specific design deliverables (wireframes, prototypes, design systems)
- Planning user testing or validation
- Building design documentation
- Unsure which design artifact to create first

### Quick Template Selection
```
Your Design Need → Recommended Template:

1. Structure layouts and plan information architecture
   → wireframe-design.md (Sitemap, wireframes, navigation, 1-2 days)

2. Create interactive prototypes for testing
   → prototype-development.md (Clickable mockups, animations, 2-3 days)

3. Build scalable design system or component library
   → design-system-creation.md (Components, tokens, guidelines, 1-2 weeks)

4. Plan and conduct usability testing
   → usability-testing-plan.md (Test plan, scripts, analysis, 1 week)
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Start with wireframes** - Use wireframe-design.md to plan structure and layout
2. **Build prototype** - Use prototype-development.md to create interactive mockup
3. **Test with users** - Use usability-testing-plan.md to validate design decisions

**Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks for basic UI design cycle, 3-4 weeks with full design system

**Pro tip**: Go low-fidelity first. Start with simple wireframes to validate structure before investing time in high-fidelity visuals or comprehensive design systems.

## Typical Design Project Workflow

Most comprehensive UX/UI design projects follow this sequence:

```
1. WIREFRAME DESIGN
   └─> Create information architecture and wireframes
   └─> Define layout systems and navigation
   └─> Establish component structure

2. PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT
   └─> Build interactive prototypes
   └─> Design interactions and animations
   └─> Prepare for user testing

3. USABILITY TESTING
   └─> Conduct user testing sessions
   └─> Collect feedback and metrics
   └─> Identify issues for iteration

4. ITERATE & REFINE
   └─> Address usability findings
   └─> Refine designs based on feedback
   └─> Re-test critical flows if needed

5. DESIGN SYSTEM CREATION
   └─> Formalize design patterns
   └─> Create component library
   └─> Document for development
```

## Choosing the Right Template

### Choose **Wireframe Design** if you're:
- Starting a new product or feature
- Defining information architecture
- Planning responsive layouts
- Mapping user flows
- Working on structural foundation

### Choose **Prototype Development** if you're:
- Ready to test interactions
- Validating design concepts
- Presenting to stakeholders
- Designing animations and transitions
- Preparing for user testing

### Choose **Design System Creation** if you're:
- Scaling design across products
- Establishing design standards
- Creating reusable components
- Preparing for development handoff
- Building long-term design infrastructure

### Choose **Usability Testing Plan** if you're:
- Validating design decisions
- Testing with real users
- Measuring design effectiveness
- Identifying usability issues
- Planning research studies

## Using Multiple Templates Together

For comprehensive design projects, you'll often use multiple templates in sequence:

### Example 1: New Product Launch
1. Start with **Wireframe Design** to establish structure
2. Move to **Prototype Development** for interactive mockups
3. Use **Usability Testing Plan** to validate with users
4. Create **Design System** for scalable implementation

### Example 2: Feature Enhancement
1. Use **Wireframe Design** for new feature structure
2. Build **Prototype** to test the new interaction
3. Run **Usability Testing** to validate improvements
4. Update **Design System** with new components

### Example 3: Design System Initiative
1. Audit existing designs using **Wireframe** concepts
2. Create **Prototypes** to test pattern consistency
3. Conduct **Usability Testing** to validate components
4. Build comprehensive **Design System**

## Quick Reference

| Template | Primary Focus | Timeline | Team Size | Complexity |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Wireframe Design | Structure & IA | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 designers | Low-Medium |
| Prototype Development | Interactions | 1-3 weeks | 1-3 designers | Medium-High |
| Design System | Consistency | 4-12 weeks | 2-5 designers | High |
| Usability Testing | Validation | 2-4 weeks | 2-4 researchers | Medium |

## Best Practices Across All Templates

1. **Start with clear objectives** - Define success criteria before beginning
2. **Focus on user needs** - Base decisions on user research and data
3. **Iterate continuously** - Treat design as an ongoing process
4. **Document thoroughly** - Maintain clear records for team alignment
5. **Test early and often** - Validate assumptions with real users
6. **Maintain consistency** - Use established patterns and components
7. **Consider accessibility** - Design for all users from the start
8. **Collaborate actively** - Involve stakeholders and developers early
9. **Stay flexible** - Adapt based on feedback and constraints
10. **Measure impact** - Track metrics to validate design decisions

## Need Help Choosing?

Ask yourself:
- **What deliverable do I need to produce?** → Choose the matching template
- **What stage is my project in?** → Earlier stages use Wireframe, later use Prototype/System
- **Who is my audience?** → Stakeholders (Prototype), Developers (System), Users (Testing)
- **What's my timeline?** → Quick validation (Testing), Long-term (System)
