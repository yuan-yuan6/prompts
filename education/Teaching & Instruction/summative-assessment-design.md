## Purpose
Create comprehensive student assessment strategies covering formative and summative evaluation methods, rubric development, feedback systems, and performance measurement to enhance learning outcomes and provide meaningful evaluation of student progress and achievement.


## Quick Start

**Need to assess student learning quickly?** Use this minimal example:


### Minimal Example

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Plan assessment mix** - Combine formative checks and summative evaluations
2. **Create clear criteria** - Develop rubrics with specific performance levels
3. **Design feedback loops** - Build in timely, actionable feedback mechanisms

**Time to complete**: 1-2 hours for unit assessment plan, 3-5 hours for comprehensive strategy
