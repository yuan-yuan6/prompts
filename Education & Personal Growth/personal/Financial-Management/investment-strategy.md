# Investment Strategy Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive investment portfolios with proper risk management, diversification strategies, and long-term wealth building approaches tailored to individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

## Quick Investment Strategy Prompt

Develop an investment strategy for me. I'm [age] years old with [risk tolerance - conservative/moderate/aggressive] risk tolerance and [amount] to invest. My primary goal is [retirement/wealth building/specific purchase] with a [timeframe] horizon. Current investments include [existing holdings if any]. Recommend asset allocation percentages, specific low-cost fund options, rebalancing schedule, and tax-efficient account placement strategy.

## Quick Start

Begin building your investment strategy in 3 steps:

1. **Assess Your Starting Point** - Determine your:
   - Risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, or aggressive)
   - Investment timeline (years until you need the money)
   - Available capital for investing
   - Current financial obligations and emergency fund status

2. **Define Core Variables** - Fill in these key fields:
   - `INVESTOR_PROFILE`: Your current life stage (e.g., "35-year-old professional")
   - `RISK_TOLERANCE`: Based on your comfort with market volatility
   - `INVESTMENT_GOALS`: Primary objective (e.g., "Retirement in 30 years")
   - `INVESTMENT_TIMEFRAME`: When you'll need the money
   - `INVESTMENT_CAPITAL`: Amount available to invest

3. **Start Simple** - Begin with a basic diversified portfolio using low-cost index funds or target-date funds. Review quarterly and increase sophistication as you gain experience.

**Pro Tip**: If you're new to investing, start with a target-date fund matching your retirement year. It automatically adjusts risk as you age and requires minimal management.
