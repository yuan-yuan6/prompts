8. **Plan for iteration** - Budget time for feedback and refinement
9. **Monitor post-launch** - Track metrics and user feedback for optimization
10. **Document decisions** - Maintain rationale for future reference

## Tips for Success

- Create a handoff checklist to ensure nothing is missed
- Use design tokens to maintain consistency between design and code
- Build relationships with developers through pair design/coding sessions
- Automate visual regression testing to catch implementation drift
- Create a shared component library used by both design and development
- Use feature flags for safer, gradual rollouts
- Set up analytics before launch to track key metrics from day one
- Plan design QA checkpoints throughout implementation
- Document technical constraints early to avoid late surprises
- Celebrate launches and share learnings with the team

## Customization Options

### 1. Team Structure
Adapt collaboration approach for team setup (co-located, distributed, agency, in-house) with appropriate processes.

### 2. Technology Stack
Customize handoff for specific technologies (React, Vue, native mobile) with framework-appropriate specifications.

### 3. Project Complexity
Scale documentation and QA based on complexity (simple website vs. enterprise application) with appropriate rigor.

### 4. Timeline Constraints
Balance thoroughness with speed based on timeline (rapid launch vs. careful rollout) while maintaining quality.

### 5. Resource Availability
Adjust handoff detail and support level based on team size and expertise (large team vs. solo developer).
