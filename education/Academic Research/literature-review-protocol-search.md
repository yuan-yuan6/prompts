## Best Practices

1. **Register your protocol before starting** - Pre-registration ensures transparency and prevents outcome switching
2. **Involve an information specialist** - Librarians and search experts improve search quality significantly
3. **Test search strategies with known articles** - Verify your search captures key papers in the field
4. **Document everything systematically** - Comprehensive documentation enables reproducibility and transparency
5. **Use multiple databases** - No single database provides complete coverage of any field
6. **Balance sensitivity and specificity** - Aim for comprehensive coverage while managing feasibility
7. **Plan for search updates** - Literature reviews can take months; plan for updating searches
8. **Include grey literature strategically** - Consider unpublished work but assess quality carefully
9. **Establish clear stopping rules** - Define when search is complete to prevent scope creep
10. **Seek peer review of protocol** - External review identifies gaps and improves rigor

## Tips for Success

- Start with a focused research question using PICO or similar framework
- Conduct preliminary searches to assess literature volume and refine scope
- Consult with subject experts to identify key terms and databases
- Use controlled vocabulary (MeSH, etc.) alongside free-text terms
- Document search strategies exactly as executed for reproducibility
- Build in time for protocol revision based on pilot work
- Consider resource constraints when planning database coverage
- Plan for multi-stage screening with clear decision rules
- Establish inter-rater reliability targets before full screening
- Build consensus procedures into timeline and team workflow

## Next Steps

After completing your protocol and search strategy, proceed to:
- **[literature-review-selection-quality.md](literature-review-selection-quality.md)** - Study selection and quality assessment
- **[literature-review-extraction-synthesis.md](literature-review-extraction-synthesis.md)** - Data extraction and synthesis
