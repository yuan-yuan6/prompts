# Customer Experience Optimization Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to improve customer experience systematically through journey insights, experimentation, operational changes, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess CX optimization readiness for [BUSINESS] with current [NPS_BASELINE] NPS and goal [NPS_TARGET]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Journey visibility & feedback, (2) Root-cause analysis, (3) Experimentation & iteration, (4) Operational execution, (5) Cross-functional governance, (6) Measurement & outcomes. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Journey Visibility & Feedback
- 1 — Initial: Feedback is sporadic; journeys are not mapped.
- 3 — Defined: Journey maps and feedback sources; contact reasons and pain points tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Feedback is continuous; signals are unified and actionable.

### 2) Root-Cause Analysis
- 1 — Initial: Teams treat symptoms; problems recur.
- 3 — Defined: Root-cause methods and owners; defect categories defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Root causes are addressed systematically; recurrence declines.

### 3) Experimentation & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: Changes are untested; impact unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Basic experiment process; test backlog and prioritization.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation is routine; learnings compound and guide investment.

### 4) Operational Execution
- 1 — Initial: Improvements stall in handoffs; ownership unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Execution plan with owners, timelines, and QA.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is predictable; changes roll out reliably.

### 5) Cross-Functional Governance
- 1 — Initial: No alignment across teams; decisions are slow.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence; decision rights; escalation path.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; improvements scale across functions.

### 6) Measurement & Outcomes
- 1 — Initial: KPIs are inconsistent; impact isn’t tracked.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs and dashboards; outcomes tracked to initiatives.
- 5 — Optimized: Outcomes are predictable; CX improvements tie to retention and revenue.

## Deliverables
- CX readiness scorecard and prioritized gaps
- Journey map and top pain-point backlog
- Experimentation plan and measurement approach
- Execution plan with owners and timelines
- Governance cadence and KPI dashboard spec

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [NPS_BASELINE]: Current NPS/CSAT
- [NPS_TARGET]: Target NPS/CSAT
- [TOP_JOURNEYS]: Highest-volume journeys
- [CONTACT_RATE]: Support contact rate
- [CHURN_RATE]: Churn rate

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: E-commerce retailer with high returns and support contacts
- Scores (1–5): Visibility 3; RCA 2; Experiments 2; Execution 2; Governance 2; Outcomes 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize RCA; run top 5 experiments; implement governance cadence and KPI reporting
