# Grid Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage grid operations reliably, including forecasting, dispatch, reliability, and incident response.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess grid management readiness for system [GRID]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Observability & telemetry, (2) Forecasting & planning, (3) Dispatch & control, (4) Reliability & resilience, (5) Cyber/physical security, (6) Governance & compliance. Provide a scorecard and operational improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Observability & Telemetry
- 1 — Initial: Telemetry incomplete; visibility limited.
- 3 — Defined: Telemetry coverage defined; QA and alarms exist.
- 5 — Optimized: High-fidelity observability supports fast, accurate decisions.

### 2) Forecasting & Planning
- 1 — Initial: Forecasts unreliable; planning reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Forecasting models and planning cadence defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Forecasts are accurate; planning optimizes reliability and cost.

### 3) Dispatch & Control
- 1 — Initial: Controls inconsistent; manual interventions common.
- 3 — Defined: Dispatch procedures and control systems documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Dispatch is optimized with automation and strong safeguards.

### 4) Reliability & Resilience
- 1 — Initial: Outages frequent; response slow.
- 3 — Defined: Resilience plan exists; drills and playbooks used.
- 5 — Optimized: Resilience is strong; recovery is fast and repeatable.

### 5) Security
- 1 — Initial: Security controls weak; incidents unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Security standards and monitoring; incident response defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Security is mature with continuous monitoring and testing.

### 6) Governance & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Compliance ad-hoc; reporting inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance processes and reporting cadence defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance supports audits and continuous improvement.

## Deliverables
- Grid readiness scorecard and risk register
- Telemetry coverage and alarm plan
- Forecasting and planning process
- Dispatch/control SOPs and safeguards
- Resilience and incident response playbooks

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [GRID]: Grid/system
- [TELEMETRY]: Telemetry sources
- [FORECASTS]: Forecast types
- [DISPATCH]: Dispatch approach
- [RELIABILITY]: Reliability targets
- [COMPLIANCE]: Compliance requirements

## Example (Condensed)
- Grid: Regional distribution network
- Scores (1–5): Telemetry 2; Forecasting 2; Dispatch 3; Resilience 2; Security 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Expand telemetry; improve forecasting; formalize playbooks; strengthen security monitoring
