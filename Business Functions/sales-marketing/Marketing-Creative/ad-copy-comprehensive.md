# Comprehensive Ad Copy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan, produce, test, and scale ad copy across multiple platforms and formats while maintaining message consistency, compliance, and measurable performance improvement.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess comprehensive ad copy readiness for [BRAND] promoting [OFFER] to [PRIMARY_AUDIENCE] across [PRIMARY_PLATFORM] plus [SECONDARY_PLATFORMS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Offer & positioning, (2) Audience & insight system, (3) Creative/message architecture, (4) Channel adaptation & operations, (5) Production workflow & governance, (6) Measurement, experimentation & compliance. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan to improve copy quality and conversion outcomes.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Offer & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: Offers are inconsistent; differentiation is unclear; copy relies on generic promises.
- 3 — Defined: Clear positioning and value proposition; offers have owners; proof points are identified.
- 5 — Optimized: Offer strategy is segmented by audience and funnel stage; proof is continuously strengthened; messaging is consistent across touchpoints.

### 2) Audience & Insight System
- 1 — Initial: Audience definitions are broad; limited research; objections are poorly understood.
- 3 — Defined: Personas, intent signals, and objection maps exist; research and performance insights feed briefs.
- 5 — Optimized: Ongoing insight pipeline (research + creative analytics); segments are operationalized; learnings are captured and reused.

### 3) Creative/Message Architecture
- 1 — Initial: One-off copy; no structured angle library; brand voice drifts between campaigns.
- 3 — Defined: Message pillars, approved claims, CTA conventions; angle library supports rapid variants.
- 5 — Optimized: A coherent creative system scales across channels; claims/proof/CTAs are governed; personalization is controlled and measurable.

### 4) Channel Adaptation & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Copy is reused without adaptation; channel constraints are learned late.
- 3 — Defined: Platform-specific patterns and limits are documented; copy is adapted to placements and intent.
- 5 — Optimized: Channel playbooks and reusable templates; rapid adaptation without quality loss; clear orchestration across funnel stages.

### 5) Production Workflow & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Briefing and approvals are inconsistent; rework is high; ownership unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Creative brief standard; review/approval workflow; QA checklist; version control for variants.
- 5 — Optimized: Predictable throughput with SLAs; governance prevents brand drift; feedback loops reduce rework and improve outcomes.

### 6) Measurement, Experimentation & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: KPIs unclear; tracking gaps; testing is sporadic; compliance handled after drafts.
- 3 — Defined: Measurement plan; A/B testing cadence; tracking QA; compliance checks and substantiation process.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program; statistical rigor; creative analytics + learnings repository; compliance is embedded and auditable.

## Deliverables
- Multi-platform readiness scorecard with evidence and top gaps
- Offer/messaging framework (positioning, claims, proof, CTAs)
- Channel playbooks (formats, constraints, intent, do/don’t)
- Testing and measurement plan (hypotheses, metrics, cadence)
- Compliance and approvals workflow (claims substantiation, required disclosures)
- 90-day improvement roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND]: Brand or product name
- [OFFER]: Trial, demo, discount, bundle, subscription, consultation
- [PRIMARY_AUDIENCE]: Primary persona or segment
- [PRIMARY_PLATFORM]: Primary channel (Search, Meta, LinkedIn, Display)
- [SECONDARY_PLATFORMS]: Secondary channels to adapt copy to
- [CLAIM_TYPES]: Allowed claims and required substantiation
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: CTR, CVR, CAC, CPL, ROAS, retention, lift metrics

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: DTC skincare launching a subscription offer
- Channels: Meta + Google Search
- Scores (1–5): Offer 3; Insights 2; Message System 3; Channel Ops 2; Workflow 3; Testing/Compliance 2
- Top gaps: Weak objection handling; inconsistent channel adaptation; limited experimentation discipline
- 90-day priorities: Build objections/proof library; create channel playbooks; implement weekly test cadence and learnings repository
