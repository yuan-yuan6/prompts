# Financial Risk Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to identify, quantify, and communicate financial risks using scenarios, sensitivities, and a monitoring loop that supports timely mitigation.

## Quick Prompt
Assess financial risk readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] with [REVENUE] revenue and [TOTAL_DEBT] debt. Evaluate coverage of risk types (liquidity, credit, market, operating), scenario design discipline, quantification and thresholds, mitigation actionability, monitoring/KRIs, and governance/communication. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Risk Coverage & Inventory
- 1: Risks are discussed informally; key exposures are missing.
- 3: A list exists for major risks; periodic refresh.
- 5: Risk inventory is complete, owned, and refreshed on a cadence.

2) Scenario Design & Stress Testing
- 1: Single-point views; limited downside framing.
- 3: Base and downside scenarios exist for key decisions.
- 5: Driver-based scenarios, stress tests, and triggers are standardized.

3) Quantification, Metrics & Thresholds
- 1: Mostly qualitative; thresholds unclear.
- 3: Some quantification (cash runway, covenant headroom) for major risks.
- 5: Quantified sensitivities, KRIs, and thresholds tied to actions.

4) Liquidity & Funding Readiness
- 1: Cash planning is reactive; runway unclear.
- 3: Basic runway and debt schedule tracked.
- 5: Integrated liquidity model with contingency actions and access-to-capital plan.

5) Mitigation Planning & Ownership
- 1: Mitigations are vague; owners missing.
- 3: Mitigations exist for top risks; tracking is uneven.
- 5: Action plans have owners, timelines, costs, and measurable impact.

6) Governance, Monitoring & Communication
- 1: No monitoring cadence; stakeholders surprised.
- 3: Monthly/quarterly reviews for key risks.
- 5: Formal governance, dashboards, and escalation paths are standard.

## Deliverables
- Risk inventory (risk statement, owner, drivers, time horizon)
- Scenario set (base, downside, severe stress) with clear assumptions
- Sensitivity summary (key drivers and thresholds)
- Risk/impact summary (top risks and likelihood/impact view)
- Mitigation plan (actions, owners, timelines, triggers)
- Monitoring pack (KRIs, cadence, escalation rules)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — risk discussions are ad hoc and qualitative.
- Level 2: Documented — risk lists exist; scenarios are inconsistent.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard scenarios and metrics are used for key decisions.
- Level 4: Managed — quantified thresholds, monitoring, and mitigation governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — risks are managed proactively with continuous learning.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [REVENUE]
- [TOTAL_DEBT]
- [CASH]
- [DEBT_SCHEDULE]
- [COVENANTS] (definitions and thresholds)
- [RISK_TYPES] (liquidity, credit, market, operating)
- [SCENARIOS] (base, downside, stress)

## Example (Condensed)
Mid-market manufacturer with a refinance due in 18 months.
- Risks: liquidity (runway and revolver headroom), credit (customer concentration), market (rates/FX), operating (margin volatility).
- Scenarios: downside revenue -10% with margin -150 bps; stress revenue -20% with working capital drag.
- Outputs: covenant headroom by quarter, cash runway timing, triggers for cost actions and funding steps.
