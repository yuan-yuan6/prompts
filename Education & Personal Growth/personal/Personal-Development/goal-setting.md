# Goal Setting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to set, pursue, and achieve meaningful personal and professional goals across six dimensions: Goal Clarity & Design, Planning & Structure, Resources & Support, Tracking & Measurement, Motivation & Commitment, and Adaptation & Learning. This framework identifies capability gaps, prioritizes development areas, and creates actionable goal-achievement strategies.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **goal-setting readiness** for **{GOAL_CONTEXT}** pursuing **{TARGET_GOALS}**. Evaluate across: (1) **Goal clarity**—are goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)? Are priorities clear and conflicts resolved? (2) **Planning quality**—are milestones defined, actions broken down, and timelines realistic? (3) **Resources & support**—what time, budget, tools, and accountability systems are available? (4) **Tracking systems**—how will progress be measured? Are KPIs defined and reviews scheduled? (5) **Motivation & commitment**—what drives pursuit? Are obstacles anticipated? What's the resilience level? (6) **Adaptation readiness**—how flexible is the approach? Are feedback loops established? Provide a readiness scorecard (1-5 per dimension), gap analysis, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day goal-achievement action plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid goal-setting readiness evaluation.

## Maturity Scale

Use this scale for dimension scoring:

**1.0-1.9 (Ad hoc):** Goals vague or undefined, no structured planning, reactive approach, minimal tracking

**2.0-2.9 (Emerging):** Basic goals set but lacks SMART criteria, informal planning, inconsistent tracking, limited support systems

**3.0-3.9 (Defined):** Clear SMART goals, structured planning, regular tracking, some support systems in place

**4.0-4.9 (Managed):** Well-designed goals with strong planning, robust tracking systems, effective support networks, proactive adaptation

**5.0 (Optimized):** Exemplary goal-setting with continuous refinement, sophisticated tracking, strong accountability, high achievement rate, systematic learning

DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding | Priority Actions |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Goal Clarity & Design | 4.0/5 | Goal is SMART with clear target company tier and timeline | Refine definition of "ready" - what skills, portfolio, network needed? |
| Planning & Structure | 3.5/5 | Monthly milestones logical but lacks specificity on skill development | Break down into weekly sprints with concrete deliverables |

GOAL PORTFOLIO ASSESSMENT

**Primary Goal:** FAANG Product Manager Role
- SMART compliance: ✓ (Specific company tier, 12-month timeline, measurable outcome)
- Resource sufficiency: △ (Time yes, network no, budget unclear)
- Tracking readiness: △ (Review cadence yes, KPIs undefined)
- Feasibility: **Moderate** - Achievable with network building and portfolio development

Recommended Adjustments:

GAP ANALYSIS

**Gap 1: Limited Product Management Network** (Impact: High | Urgency: High)
- Root cause: Engineer networks skew technical; no systematic outreach strategy
- Impact: Missing referrals, insights into PM role, interview prep support
- Actions: Join PM communities (Product School, Reforge), attend meetups, 3 coffee chats/month
- Timeline: Start immediately, build foundation in 90 days

**Gap 2: No Product Portfolio** (Impact: High | Urgency: High)
- Root cause: Engineer role focused on delivery, not product thinking documentation
- Impact: Can't demonstrate product judgment in applications/interviews
- Actions: Document 2 past projects as PM case studies, create side project with user research
- Timeline: Complete first case study by week 4, all 3 by month 4

**Gap 3: Unclear PM Skill Gaps** (Impact: Medium | Urgency: High)
- Root cause: Haven't mapped current skills to PM competency model
- Impact: Inefficient learning, may miss critical competencies
- Actions: Complete PM skill assessment, identify top 5 gaps, prioritize courses/practice
- Timeline: Complete by week 2, build learning plan by week 3

**Gap 4: Insufficient Interview Preparation** (Impact: High | Urgency: Medium)
- Root cause: Unfamiliar with FAANG PM interview formats (product design, strategy, estimation)
- Impact: May waste opportunities with poor interview performance
- Actions: Research interview formats, practice with PM peers, do 10 mock interviews
- Timeline: Start month 4, intensive prep months 6-9

**Gap 5: No Fallback Plan** (Impact: Medium | Urgency: Low)
- Root cause: Single target (FAANG) creates risk if timeline slips
- Impact: Potential discouragement if primary path stalls
- Actions: Identify 2-3 alternative paths (startup PM, internal transition, PM-adjacent roles)
- Timeline: Define by month 3, keep warm throughout
