## Template

## Quick Start

Establish comprehensive compliance management in 5 steps:

1. **Conduct Regulatory Inventory**: Document all applicable federal, state, local, and international regulations—categorize by functional area (financial, privacy, labor, environmental) and enforcement authority
2. **Perform Risk Assessment**: Evaluate inherent compliance risks using probability × impact scoring—identify top 10 risks that could result in regulatory penalties, operational disruption, or reputational damage
3. **Build Policy Framework**: Create a 4-tier policy hierarchy (Tier 1: high-level policies, Tier 2: standards, Tier 3: procedures, Tier 4: work instructions) with clear ownership and annual review cycles
4. **Implement GRC Technology**: Deploy a Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) platform to centralize policy management, automate risk assessments, track incidents, and generate regulatory reports
5. **Establish Metrics & Reporting**: Define compliance KPIs (training completion %, policy violations, audit findings, regulatory exam results) and create executive dashboards for board-level oversight

**Pro Tip**: Integrate compliance into business processes from the start—embedding compliance checkpoints in workflows (e.g., contract approval, vendor onboarding, product launch) prevents violations more effectively than retroactive audits.
