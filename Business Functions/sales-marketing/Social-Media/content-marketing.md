# Content Marketing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan, produce, distribute, and measure content marketing that reliably drives awareness, demand, and customer trust.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess content marketing readiness for [ORGANIZATION] targeting [AUDIENCE] with goals [TRAFFIC_TARGET] visits/month and [PIPELINE_TARGET] pipeline/month. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategy & audience insight, (2) Editorial planning, (3) Content production system, (4) Distribution & amplification, (5) Measurement & governance, (6) Optimization & iteration. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategy & Audience Insight
- 1 — Initial: Content is ad-hoc; audience and intent are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Audience, objectives, and topics are defined; content maps to funnel stages.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is refreshed by data; topics and formats are proven and repeatable.

### 2) Editorial Planning
- 1 — Initial: No editorial calendar; prioritization is reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Editorial calendar exists with owners, briefs, and review points.
- 5 — Optimized: Planning cadence is reliable; backlog and reuse strategy reduce waste.

### 3) Content Production System
- 1 — Initial: Production depends on individuals; inconsistent quality and turnaround.
- 3 — Defined: Standard briefs, templates, QA, and roles; consistent quality.
- 5 — Optimized: Production scales with modular assets and clear workflows.

### 4) Distribution & Amplification
- 1 — Initial: Publishing is “post and hope”; limited channel strategy.
- 3 — Defined: Distribution plan by channel; repurposing and promotion are defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Amplification is optimized by channel performance and audience behavior.

### 5) Measurement & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are unclear; reporting inconsistent; ownership missing.
- 3 — Defined: KPI definitions and dashboards; governance cadence and decision rights.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement ties to business outcomes; governance enables speed and consistency.

### 6) Optimization & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: Little experimentation; learnings not captured.
- 3 — Defined: Regular experiments; retro cadence; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement loop; content compounds in performance over time.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with prioritized gap list
- Content strategy brief (audience, objectives, topics, funnel mapping)
- Editorial calendar and production workflow
- Distribution plan by channel with repurposing rules
- Measurement plan and experiment cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [AUDIENCE]: Target audience/segments
- [TRAFFIC_TARGET]: Monthly traffic goal
- [PIPELINE_TARGET]: Monthly pipeline goal
- [CONTENT_TYPES]: Blog, video, webinar, case study, newsletter
- [CHANNELS]: SEO, email, social, partners, community

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: B2B services firm scaling inbound demand
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Planning 2; Production 2; Distribution 2; Governance 2; Optimization 2
- 90-day priorities: Define briefs + calendar; standardize workflow; add distribution playbooks and KPI cadence
