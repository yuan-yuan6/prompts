# Home Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to create an efficient, comfortable, well-maintained home across six dimensions: priorities, organization systems, routines, maintenance planning, roles/tools, and sustainability.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **home management readiness** for **{HOUSEHOLD_PROFILE}** aiming for **{HOME_GOALS}** within **{CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension **1–5**, justify scores, and provide a prioritized 30-day plan (weekly cadence + checklists). Include metrics that make the system self-correcting.

---

## Template

Conduct a home management readiness assessment for {HOUSEHOLD_PROFILE} aiming for {HOME_GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) PRIORITIES & SCOPE CLARITY**
- Clear definition of “good enough” (what matters vs what can slip)
- Known pain points and high-friction zones (kitchen, entry, laundry, papers)
- Constraints acknowledged (time, energy, health, household complexity)

**2) ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS (SPACE + STORAGE)**
- Logical homes for common items (point-of-use storage)
- Containers/labels used to reduce decision fatigue
- Intake control (mail, packages, shopping) to prevent re-cluttering

**3) ROUTINES & HABITS (CLEANING + RESET)**
- Simple daily reset and weekly rhythm (minimal viable version exists)
- Task chunking (what must happen daily/weekly/monthly)
- Friction reduction (checklists, timers, “closing duties”)

**4) MAINTENANCE PLANNING**
- Preventive maintenance calendar (seasonal and annual)
- Tracking system for warranties, filters, service providers
- Issue triage (what to fix now vs later)

**5) ROLES, ACCOUNTABILITY & TOOLS**
- Clear ownership (who does what, when) and fair workload
- Tools support execution (shared calendar, task list, reminders)
- Budget alignment (supplies, repairs, outsourcing where needed)

**6) SUSTAINABILITY & WELLBEING**
- System is realistic with life variability (busy weeks, travel, illness)
- Boundary setting (standards, visitors, “not now” rules)
- Recovery built in (avoid perfectionism and burnout)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 30 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary constraint

3) **AREA READINESS (ROOMS / ZONES)**
- Entry, kitchen, bathroom(s), bedroom(s), laundry, paperwork/admin, storage
- For each: current friction, quick win, “definition of done”

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **30-DAY HOME RESET PLAN**
- Week 1–4 cadence with specific tasks
- Include: daily reset, weekly routine, maintenance starter calendar

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30-day targets for: daily reset completion rate, laundry backlog days, clutter hotspots, maintenance reminders set, time spent per week

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, reactive)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some routines, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable system, occasional breakdowns)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (consistent upkeep, low friction)
- 5.0: Optimized (self-maintaining home flywheel)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {HOUSEHOLD_PROFILE} | Household + home context | “Couple + toddler in 2BR apartment, both working” |
| {HOME_GOALS} | Desired outcomes | “Reduce clutter, keep kitchen reset nightly, stay on maintenance” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “30 min/day weekdays, 2 hrs/weekend, low energy, $50/month supplies” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {HOUSEHOLD_PROFILE}: Couple + toddler in 2BR apartment; both work full-time; laundry piles up; entryway clutter
- {HOME_GOALS}: A calm home with a 15-minute nightly reset, weekly cleaning rhythm, and basic maintenance reminders
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 20–30 min weekdays; 2 hours on Sunday; low tolerance for complex systems

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.0/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) create “homes” for entry + kitchen, (2) implement nightly reset, (3) set a maintenance reminder calendar

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary constraint |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Priorities & Scope Clarity | 3.5 | Clear goals and pain points | Limited time |
| Organization Systems | 2.5 | No defined homes for drop zones | Intake clutter |
| Routines & Habits | 3.0 | Motivation for nightly reset | Inconsistent follow-through |
| Maintenance Planning | 2.0 | No calendar or tracking | Forgetfulness |
| Roles & Tools | 3.0 | Cooperative household | No shared task system |
| Sustainability & Wellbeing | 4.0 | Wants “good enough” | Overwhelm risk |

3) **AREA READINESS (ROOMS / ZONES)**
- Entry: friction = shoes/mail/bags; quick win = 1 bin + hooks; done = floor clear nightly
- Kitchen: friction = dishes + counters; quick win = “close the kitchen” checklist; done = sink empty 4/7 nights
- Laundry: friction = piles; quick win = 2-bin sorting; done = 2 loads/week scheduled
- Paperwork: friction = unopened mail; quick win = 10-min weekly sort; done = “action” folder under control

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Drop zones multiply → no point-of-use storage → add one container per hotspot
- Gap 2: Nightly reset fails → too big → cap to 15 minutes + checklist
- Gap 3: Laundry backlog → no cadence → schedule fixed days + minimum loads
- Gap 4: Maintenance forgotten → no reminders → set seasonal calendar now
- Gap 5: Friction spikes → no fallback → define “minimum viable week” routine

5) **30-DAY HOME RESET PLAN**
- Week 1: set entry + kitchen homes; start nightly reset (15 min)
- Week 2: add laundry cadence; create Sunday 2-hour block list
- Week 3: tackle paperwork/admin (10 min/week); refine checklists
- Week 4: set seasonal maintenance reminders; prune what isn’t working

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Nightly reset completion: 0% → 60% (4 nights/week)
- Kitchen reset: 1/7 → 4/7 nights
- Laundry backlog: 7+ days → ≤2 days
- Maintenance reminders set: 0 → 12 (monthly/seasonal)
- Weekly time spent: unknown → ≤2.5 hours/week average

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Design for the “average bad day”** — systems must work when you’re tired.
2) **Use point-of-use storage** — store items where you use them, not where they “should” go.
3) **Protect the entry and kitchen first** — these two zones determine perceived chaos.
4) **Default to a nightly reset** — small daily effort beats weekend marathons.
5) **Separate routines from projects** — cleaning cadence is different from decluttering.
6) **Make ownership explicit** — unclear responsibility is a hidden failure mode.
7) **Automate reminders** — calendars beat memory for maintenance.
8) **Review monthly and simplify** — remove steps you consistently skip.
