# ESG Reporting & Disclosure Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive, credible ESG reports and disclosures that meet regulatory requirements, satisfy stakeholder expectations, align with international frameworks (GRI, SASB, TCFD, CSRD), and demonstrate transparent accountability for environmental, social, and governance performance.

## Quick Start

**Need to publish ESG report quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Mid-size technology company
Framework: GRI Standards + SASB Software & IT Services standard
Report Scope: Global operations, FY 2024 performance
Key Disclosures:
- Environmental: Scope 1,2,3 emissions (5,000 tCO2e), 80% renewable energy
- Social: 35% diverse workforce, 4.2 LTIR, 85% engagement score
- Governance: 40% diverse board, ethics training 100%, zero violations
Format: PDF sustainability report + data tables + third-party assurance (limited)
Timeline: 8-week production (data collection → draft → review → publish)
```

### When to Use This
- Annual ESG/sustainability reporting cycles
- Responding to new regulatory requirements (CSRD, SEC climate rules)
- Preparing for ESG ratings (MSCI, Sustainalytics, CDP)
- Investor requests for ESG disclosure
- Stakeholder transparency and accountability

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Framework Selection & Planning** - Choose reporting frameworks and scope (1-2 weeks)
2. **Data Collection & Verification** - Gather ESG data across organization (3-4 weeks)
3. **Report Development** - Write content, create visuals, review (4-6 weeks)
4. **Assurance & Publication** - External verification and public release (2-3 weeks)

## Best Practices

### Framework Selection
1. **Start with regulations** - Compliance first (CSRD, SEC), then voluntary frameworks
2. **Investor alignment** - Use frameworks investors expect (TCFD, SASB common)
3. **Avoid framework fatigue** - Integrate frameworks, don't create separate reports for each
4. **Digital-first for CSRD** - Plan for XBRL/iXBRL tagging from the start
5. **Sector-specific standards** - Use SASB sector standards for financial materiality

### Materiality
1. **Double materiality** - Assess impact on business AND business impact on world
2. **Stakeholder input** - Engage investors, customers, employees in materiality process
3. **Update regularly** - Refresh materiality every 2-3 years or with significant changes
4. **Focus disclosure** - Deep reporting on material topics, lighter on non-material
5. **Explain changes** - If materiality shifts, explain why

### Data Quality
1. **Single source of truth** - Centralized ESG data management system
2. **Clear ownership** - Data owners for each metric with accountability
3. **Robust controls** - Same rigor as financial data (controls, reconciliation)
4. **Document methodology** - Clear calculations, boundaries, estimates
5. **Assurance-ready** - Prepare for external verification with quality data

### Content
1. **Tell a story** - Not just data, but narrative about strategy and progress
2. **Be balanced** - Celebrate successes, acknowledge challenges honestly
3. **Show progress** - Multi-year trends, targets, achievement status
4. **Quantify impact** - Use numbers, not just qualitative descriptions
5. **Forward-looking** - Past performance + future commitments and pathway

### Design & Accessibility
1. **Visual storytelling** - Infographics, charts, photos to engage readers
2. **Scannable structure** - Executive summary, clear sections, side bars
3. **Navigation aids** - Table of contents, framework indices, glossary
4. **Digital-friendly** - Interactive web version, not just PDF
5. **Accessible** - WCAG compliance, screen reader compatible

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Greenwashing** - Cherry-picking positive data, hiding negative performance
✅ Instead: Balanced reporting with transparency on challenges and gaps

❌ **Data dumping** - Pages of metrics without context or story
✅ Instead: Strategic narrative with supporting data, not data with brief narrative

❌ **Copy-paste from prior year** - Minimal updates, stale content
✅ Instead: Fresh analysis reflecting current year performance and material events

❌ **Framework confusion** - Trying to comply with every framework separately
✅ Instead: Integrated approach with framework indices for navigation

❌ **Scope 3 avoidance** - Only reporting Scope 1&2, ignoring value chain (often 80%+)
✅ Instead: Measure and report Scope 3, acknowledge data limitations if needed

❌ **Vague commitments** - "We're committed to sustainability" without measurable targets
✅ Instead: Specific, time-bound, measurable targets with accountability

❌ **No assurance** - Self-reported data without third-party verification
✅ Instead: At minimum limited assurance on key environmental metrics, moving to reasonable

❌ **PDF-only** - Static report without interactive digital experience
✅ Instead: Interactive website with downloadable PDF, especially for CSRD (digital tagging required)

❌ **Post-and-forget** - Publish report with no stakeholder engagement
✅ Instead: Active distribution, engagement campaign, feedback mechanism

❌ **Isolated from business** - Sustainability team produces report disconnected from operations
✅ Instead: Cross-functional collaboration with business unit input and ownership
