# Video Script Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess video script readiness across six dimensions: Narrative Structure, Audience Engagement, Visual Storytelling, Dialogue Quality, Platform Optimization, and Production Feasibility. This framework identifies script weaknesses, strengthens storytelling elements, and creates revision roadmaps for compelling video content across YouTube, documentaries, commercials, tutorials, and social media.

## 🚀 Quick Script Assessment Prompt

> Assess **video script readiness** for **[PROJECT/CREATOR]** developing **[VIDEO TYPE]** with **[RUNTIME]** targeting **[PLATFORM/AUDIENCE]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Narrative structure**—does the hook capture attention in first 15 seconds? Is the story arc clear with rising action and satisfying resolution? (2) **Audience engagement**—does pacing maintain retention? Are emotional beats authentic? (3) **Visual storytelling**—do scene descriptions support visual narrative? Are camera directions clear? (4) **Dialogue quality**—is character voice authentic? Does dialogue advance plot without exposition dumps? (5) **Platform optimization**—is format appropriate for YouTube/TikTok/social media algorithms? Are retention tactics employed? Provide a readiness scorecard (1-5 per dimension), script weaknesses, revision priorities, and rewrite roadmap.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid script evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive video script readiness assessment for {PROJECT_CONTEXT}, developing {SCRIPT_SCOPE} to achieve {CONTENT_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Narrative Structure Readiness**

Assess whether story architecture creates satisfying viewer experience. Evaluate opening hook effectiveness including whether the first fifteen seconds capture attention through pattern interrupts, curiosity gaps, or emotional engagement that stops scrolling. Examine three-act structure integrity determining whether setup establishes context and stakes, confrontation builds tension through escalating obstacles, and resolution provides satisfying payoff. Review pacing and rhythm including whether scene lengths vary to maintain interest, information density matches audience sophistication, and momentum builds toward climax without drag. Analyze story coherence determining whether narrative logic is consistent, cause-and-effect relationships are clear, and plot threads resolve without confusion. Assess emotional arc progression including whether viewer emotional journey is intentionally designed from initial state through transformation to final feeling. Evaluate payoff satisfaction determining whether promises made in opening are delivered, expectations are met or purposefully subverted, and endings feel earned rather than rushed.

**2. Audience Engagement Readiness**

Evaluate whether script sustains attention and drives desired actions. Assess retention optimization including whether open loops and cliffhangers prevent drop-off, progress indicators signal value ahead, and pattern variations combat viewer fatigue. Examine value delivery pacing determining whether educational insights, entertainment moments, or emotional beats are distributed to maintain engagement throughout runtime. Review curiosity maintenance including whether questions posed are answered at strategic intervals, new intrigue is introduced as prior mysteries resolve, and information gaps drive forward momentum. Analyze relatability and relevance determining whether content addresses viewer pain points, desires, or interests with specificity that creates personal connection. Assess emotional engagement depth including whether script creates authentic feeling rather than manipulative sentiment through character vulnerability, stakes that matter, and genuine human experience. Evaluate call-to-action effectiveness determining whether desired viewer actions are clearly stated, benefit-driven, placed at natural conclusion points, and supported by motivation built throughout content.

**3. Visual Storytelling Readiness**

Assess whether script leverages visual medium rather than radio with pictures. Evaluate show-versus-tell balance including whether character emotions, story information, and thematic elements are demonstrated through action, expression, and visual metaphor rather than dialogue exposition. Examine scene description clarity determining whether visual directions give cinematographer, director, and production team sufficient guidance without over-prescribing creative interpretation. Review visual metaphor integration including whether abstract concepts are made concrete through symbolic imagery, color psychology, and compositional choices that reinforce meaning. Analyze cinematic language appropriateness determining whether shot types, camera movements, and framing suggestions match genre conventions and intended mood. Assess production design integration including whether locations, props, wardrobe, and environmental details support story world, character development, and thematic resonance. Evaluate visual pacing variety determining whether static versus dynamic shots create rhythm, wide versus close-up framing modulates intensity, and visual complexity matches information density.

**4. Dialogue Quality Readiness**

Evaluate whether character speech feels authentic and advances narrative. Assess character voice distinctiveness including whether each speaker has recognizable patterns in vocabulary, sentence structure, humor style, and worldview that differentiate them. Examine dialogue naturalism determining whether speech patterns reflect how humans actually talk with interruptions, incomplete thoughts, subtext, and context-dependent meaning rather than theatrical pronouncements. Review subtext and layering including whether characters communicate not just explicit information but underlying emotion, hidden agendas, relationship dynamics, and unspoken tensions. Analyze dialogue efficiency determining whether every line serves multiple functions—character development, plot advancement, thematic exploration, or mood creation—rather than existing solely for exposition. Assess voiceover appropriateness including whether narration adds value unavailable through visual storytelling, maintains appropriate tone and perspective, and complements rather than duplicates on-screen information. Evaluate cultural and linguistic authenticity determining whether slang, idioms, regional dialects, and generational speech patterns are researched, appropriate, and avoid stereotype or caricature.

**5. Platform Optimization Readiness**

Assess whether script is tailored for specific distribution channels and algorithms. Evaluate format appropriateness including whether runtime matches platform norms—TikTok's sixty seconds, YouTube's eight to twelve minutes, or documentary's feature length—without padding or artificial constraints. Examine algorithm-friendly elements determining whether title keywords, opening hooks, retention patterns, and engagement prompts align with platform recommendation systems. Review mobile viewing consideration including whether visual elements are legible on small screens, audio is comprehensible without headphones where appropriate, and vertical or square formats are specified when relevant. Analyze accessibility integration including whether closed captions are written into script, visual descriptions accommodate blind viewers, and content warnings precede sensitive material. Assess cross-platform adaptation planning determining whether core content can be edited into multiple lengths and formats—full YouTube video, Instagram Reels, Twitter clips—without losing coherence. Evaluate monetization compatibility including whether brand integrations feel organic, ad breaks occur at natural pause points, and sponsored content disclosure is transparent and compliant.

**6. Production Feasibility Readiness**

Evaluate whether script is achievable within project constraints. Assess budget alignment including whether location requirements, talent needs, special effects, and production design ambitions match available resources without compromising creative vision through impossible demands. Examine scheduling realism determining whether shoot days required, location count, cast size, and post-production complexity fit timeline without rushed execution that undermines quality. Review technical requirements clarity including whether script specifies necessary equipment, software, expertise, or specialized crew that require advance planning and budgeting. Analyze location and permission needs determining whether filming locations are accessible, legally permitted, weather-dependent, or require expensive travel and accommodation. Assess talent and casting requirements including whether on-camera performers need specific skills, professional actors versus authentic subjects, age ranges, diversity considerations, or celebrity recognition. Evaluate post-production scope including whether editing, color grading, visual effects, animation, sound design, and music composition demands are specified with sufficient detail for accurate time and cost estimation.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Script Overview** providing project summary, video type and runtime, target platform and audience, content objectives, and creative approach.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Script Strengths** listing what's working well including compelling moments, effective techniques, or strong character work worth protecting during revisions.

4. **Revision Priorities** identifying critical weaknesses ranked by impact on viewer experience and production success, with specific improvement recommendations.

5. **Rewrite Roadmap** providing phased actions: structural fixes addressing narrative architecture, dialogue polish refining character voice, visual enhancement strengthening cinematic storytelling, and platform optimization tailoring for distribution.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what production-ready script looks like including narrative coherence benchmarks, engagement retention targets, and technical clarity standards.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with unclear narrative and weak engagement, 2.0-2.9 Developing with interesting concepts but structural problems, 3.0-3.9 Defined with solid story and clear production path, 4.0-4.9 Managed with strong narrative craft and platform optimization, 5.0 Optimized with exceptional quality ready for immediate production.
