# Motion Graphics Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive motion graphics projects including animations, effects, and transitions for digital media, broadcast, and interactive applications.

## Quick Animation Prompt
Animate [project type: explainer/logo/intro/social ad] for [brand/client]. Duration: [X sec]. Format: [resolution, fps]. Style: [smooth/snappy/dynamic]. Elements: [text/icons/characters/shapes]. Transitions: [type]. Deliver: storyboard, animatic, final render in [MP4/MOV], and source project file. Sync to [music BPM/voiceover timing] if applicable.

## Quick Start

To use this template effectively:

1. **Define Project Brief** - Specify animation type, duration, target audience, primary objective, and visual style
2. **Set Technical Specs** - Establish resolution, frame rate, aspect ratio, and deliverable format requirements
3. **Develop Style Concepts** - Create 2-3 visual direction concepts with different animation approaches
4. **Plan Scene Breakdown** - Map out key scenes with timing, visual elements, and transitions
5. **Establish Animation Style** - Define movement style (fluid/snappy), timing approach, and transition techniques

**Pro Tip**: Create a detailed storyboard or animatic before diving into production to align on timing, pacing, and visual direction with stakeholders.
