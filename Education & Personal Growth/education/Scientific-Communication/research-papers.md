# Research Paper Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your research paper is ready to draft or submit by scoring six dimensions: Journal & Audience Fit, Core Story & Contribution, Methods & Reporting Completeness, Results & Evidence Presentation, Discussion & Limitations, and Submission & Revision Workflow. Use the output to decide **go / revise-first** and to produce a tight manuscript plan.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **research paper readiness** for **{MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT}** targeting **{TARGET_VENUE}** with **{CONSTRAINTS}**.
>
> First, list any **missing information/questions** that would materially change the assessment (state assumptions only if necessary).
>
> Then score each dimension **1–5** with 1–2 sentences of evidence: (1) journal & audience fit, (2) story & contribution, (3) methods & reporting completeness, (4) results & evidence, (5) discussion & limitations, (6) submission & revision workflow.
>
> Compute the overall score (average), assign a maturity level (1–5), and recommend **go / revise-first** (justify based on the highest-risk gaps and timeline constraints).
>
> Finally, present the response using the **Required Output Format (sections 1–5)** exactly, including a prioritized revision plan.

## Template

Conduct a research paper readiness assessment for {MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT} targeting {TARGET_VENUE} with {CONSTRAINTS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. JOURNAL & AUDIENCE FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the manuscript matches venue expectations: scope, article type, novelty bar, methodological norms, word/figure limits, and audience background. Confirm you can meet required checklists (reporting standards, declarations, data sharing) and that your framing speaks to what the venue values.

**2. CORE STORY & CONTRIBUTION READINESS**
Evaluate whether the “why” is crisp: problem/gap, aim(s), and the contribution (new evidence, method, theory, or practical implication). Confirm the manuscript can be summarized in a 2–3 sentence abstract-level statement without hand-waving and that claims are proportional to evidence.

**3. METHODS & REPORTING COMPLETENESS READINESS**
Evaluate whether a reader could reproduce or audit the work: design, sample/setting, measures, procedures, and analysis decisions are documented at an appropriate level. Identify missing details that block review (eligibility, recruitment, preprocessing, assumptions, preregistration, ethics approvals).

**4. RESULTS & EVIDENCE PRESENTATION READINESS**
Evaluate whether results are clear and defensible: primary outcomes are prioritized, uncertainty is reported, and figures/tables support the claims. Confirm that exploratory analyses are labeled and that you avoid p-hacking vibes by documenting decision rules.

**5. DISCUSSION & LIMITATIONS READINESS**
Evaluate whether interpretation is honest and useful: connect back to the gap, compare to prior work, explain mechanisms cautiously, and state limitations without burying them. Confirm boundaries of generalizability and what would change your conclusion.

**6. SUBMISSION & REVISION WORKFLOW READINESS**
Evaluate whether you can ship: authorship order, roles, internal deadlines, journal formatting tasks, required files (cover letter, disclosures, figures, supplements), and a plan for revision cycles. Confirm you have a response-to-reviewers strategy and evidence you can produce if challenged.

## Required Output Format

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, go/revise-first, top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table: dimension, score (1–5), evidence, biggest gap, highest-impact fix

3. **ONE-PAGE MANUSCRIPT BLUEPRINT**
- Title + 2-sentence abstract gist
- IMRAD bullet outline (what each section must accomplish)
- Figures/tables list (what claim each supports)

4. **REVISION PLAN (TOP 10)** - The next edits to make, ranked by impact

5. **SUBMISSION CHECKLIST** - Required files + compliance items

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Initial:** Story unclear; methods/results incomplete; high mismatch to venue.
- **2 — Developing:** Draftable, but major reporting/logic gaps and weak contribution framing.
- **3 — Defined:** Coherent manuscript; evidence mostly aligned; needs tightening and compliance polish.
- **4 — Managed:** Strong narrative and figures; robust reporting; submission-ready workflow.
- **5 — Optimized:** Highly competitive package; reusable assets; fast revision cycles with minimal rework.

## Variables (Use Max 3)

| Variable | What to include | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT}` | Study type + domain + main finding | “Observational cohort; ICU outcomes; calibrated risk model” |
| `{TARGET_VENUE}` | Journal/track + article type + constraints | “JMIR; original research; 4500 words; open data preferred” |
| `{CONSTRAINTS}` | Timeline, co-author availability, data sharing limits | “Submit in 3 weeks; IRB limits data sharing; 4 authors” |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- `{MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT}`: “Mixed-methods evaluation of a new nurse training program across 3 hospitals.”
- `{TARGET_VENUE}`: “Health services journal; original research; requires limitations and implementation relevance.”
- `{CONSTRAINTS}`: “Submit in 4 weeks; 2 co-authors limited availability; de-identified data only.”

**Output (abridged)**
- Executive summary: 3.0/5 (Defined), **revise-first**
- Biggest gaps: unclear primary outcome; figures not tied to claims; discussion overstates causality
- Next edits: specify primary outcome and estimand; rebuild results section around 2–3 core figures; add limitations and implementation boundary conditions; align title/abstract to venue framing
