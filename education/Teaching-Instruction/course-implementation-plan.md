# Course Implementation & Project Management

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive project plan for course development, implementation, and launch, including timelines, resource management, stakeholder coordination, and risk mitigation.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: A project management plan for developing and launching a course

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and launch date
- Project type (new course, major redesign, online conversion)
- Development time available
- Team members and resources

**5-minute starter**:
1. Count backwards from your launch date to identify your development window
2. List major tasks: design (objectives, content), develop (materials, assessments), test (LMS, technology), prepare (orientation, first week)
3. Identify what you must do yourself vs. what requires help (instructional designer, IT, peer review)
4. Note critical deadlines that can't move (approval deadlines, registration dates)
5. Identify your biggest risk (time, expertise, technology, budget) and one mitigation strategy

**Common first use**: "Create implementation plan for 'Introduction to Data Science' launching in 8 months. Building from scratch, need Python environment, datasets for projects. Team: me (lead), instructional designer, IT for software. Budget: $2,000. Must get curriculum committee approval 2 months before launch."

**Expected output**: Detailed project plan with phase-by-phase timeline (6 phases from analysis to evaluation), resource allocation plan, team roles, stakeholder communication strategy, risk management plan, approval process tracking, quality assurance checklist, and launch readiness verification.

**Best for**: New course development, major course redesigns, online conversions, managing complex course projects, coordinating teams, staying on schedule, ensuring launch readiness.

- **Mitigation**: Build buffer time, prioritize essential components, start early
- **Contingency**: Use existing materials temporarily, simplify some elements

**Technology Risks**:
- **Risk**: Technology doesn't work as expected or has learning curve
- **Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Test early, have training, choose reliable tools
- **Contingency**: Have backup tools/methods, simplify tech if needed

**Resource Risks**:
- **Risk**: Budget or staff support insufficient
- **Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Identify resources early, request support proactively
- **Contingency**: Scale back scope, use free alternatives, DIY approach

**Quality Risks**:
- **Risk**: Course quality doesn't meet standards
- **Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Follow quality checklist, get peer review, pilot test
- **Contingency**: Delay launch if critical issues, iterate quickly

**Student Success Risks**:
- **Risk**: Students struggle to learn or complete course
- **Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Pilot content, provide scaffolding, build in support
- **Contingency**: Adjust difficulty, provide additional resources, offer extensions

**Enrollment Risks** (for new courses):
- **Risk**: Low enrollment, course may be cancelled
- **Likelihood**: Varies | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Market course well, clear value proposition, flexible scheduling
- **Contingency**: Offer as independent study, combine sections, delay to next term

### Issue Tracking and Resolution

**Issue Log Template**:
| Date | Issue | Impact | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| [Date] | [Description] | [High/Med/Low] | [Who's fixing it] | [Open/In Progress/Resolved] | [What was done] |

**Escalation Process**:
- Try to resolve at instructor/team level first
- Escalate to department if resources or authority needed
- Involve administration for major problems or policy issues
- Document issues and resolutions for future reference

## 6. PROJECT MONITORING AND CONTROL

### Progress Tracking

**Weekly Check-Ins**:
- Review tasks completed this week
- Identify tasks for next week
- Note any blockers or delays
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Communicate status to stakeholders

**Milestone Reviews**:
- At each major milestone, assess:
  - Were deliverables completed?
  - Is quality acceptable?
  - Are we on schedule?
  - Any risks or issues emerged?
  - What adjustments needed?

**Dashboard Metrics**:
- % of tasks completed on time
- Budget spent vs. remaining
- Quality checklist items completed
- Risks identified and mitigated
- Approvals obtained

### Scope Management

**Change Control Process**:
If scope needs to change (add or remove deliverables):
1. Document proposed change and rationale
2. Assess impact on timeline, budget, quality
3. Get approval from appropriate stakeholder
4. Update project plan and communicate
5. Implement change
6. Monitor impact

**Preventing Scope Creep**:
- Refer back to scope statement regularly
- Evaluate new ideas: critical or nice-to-have?
- "Parking lot" for future iterations
- Focus on minimum viable course (MVP) first
- Enhancements can come in version 2.0
