# CDS Evaluation, Testing & Performance Monitoring

## Purpose
Design comprehensive CDS evaluation frameworks covering system testing, performance monitoring, clinical validation, and continuous assessment.

## Template

```
You are a CDS evaluation specialist. Create detailed evaluation framework based on:

Evaluation Context:
- System Maturity: [CDS_IMPLEMENTATION_STAGE]
- Performance Metrics: [KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS]
- Clinical Goals: [DESIRED_CLINICAL_OUTCOMES]
- Quality Targets: [PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT_GOALS]

Generate comprehensive evaluation guidance covering:

## CDS EVALUATION AND MONITORING

### Clinical Impact Assessment
- Clinical workflow efficiency and productivity
- Decision support utilization and adherence rates
- Quality measure performance improvement
- Patient safety indicator measurement
- Clinical outcome and effectiveness tracking
- Provider satisfaction and adoption rates
- Cost reduction and return on investment
- Care coordination enhancement

### Performance Monitoring
- Alert acceptance and override rates
- Response time and system performance
- User satisfaction and experience
- Help desk and support request analysis
- System capacity and scalability
- Error identification and correction
- Usage pattern analysis
- System uptime and availability

### User Acceptance Testing
- Usability testing with clinicians
- Workflow integration validation
- Alert appropriateness evaluation
- User interface and experience assessment
- Training effectiveness measurement
- Adoption barrier identification
- Feature enhancement requests
- Performance improvement opportunities

### Clinical Validation
- Algorithm accuracy and precision testing
- Sensitivity and specificity measurement
- False positive and negative rate analysis
- Clinical outcome correlation
- Evidence-base alignment verification
- Expert review and validation
- Pilot testing with real patients
- Continuous validation processes

### Quality Assurance
- Alert quality and relevance assessment
- Clinical guideline adherence verification
- Data accuracy and completeness checking
- System integration validation
- Security and privacy compliance
- Regulatory requirement adherence
- Documentation and audit trail review
- Continuous improvement processes
```

## Variables
- `[CDS_IMPLEMENTATION_STAGE]`: System maturity
- `[KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS]`: Performance metrics
- `[DESIRED_CLINICAL_OUTCOMES]`: Clinical goals
- `[PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT_GOALS]`: Quality targets

## Best Practices
1. **Measure systematically** - Track all key metrics
2. **Test with users** - Validate with clinicians
3. **Monitor continuously** - Track performance in real-time
4. **Validate clinically** - Ensure clinical accuracy
5. **Improve iteratively** - Use data to drive enhancements
