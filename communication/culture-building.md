# Culture Building & Engagement Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for strengthening organizational culture, reinforcing values, implementing recognition programs, and driving employee engagement initiatives that create a positive, productive, and aligned workplace environment.

## Quick Start

Build a stronger culture starting today:

1. **Define Your Core Values** - Gather your leadership team and identify 3-5 core values that truly reflect how your organization operates (not aspirational, but actual). For each value, write 3-4 specific behaviors that demonstrate it in action. Example: "Collaboration" = shares knowledge openly, seeks input from others, celebrates team wins.

2. **Launch Peer Recognition** - Implement a simple recognition system where employees can acknowledge colleagues who demonstrate company values. This can be as simple as a Slack channel, email shoutouts, or sticky notes on a "kudos board." Make it easy and immediate - recognition works best when it's timely.

3. **Create Regular Rituals** - Start one new team ritual this month: weekly team lunch, monthly birthday celebrations, quarterly team offsites, or daily stand-ups with personal check-ins. Consistency matters more than scale - small, regular rituals build stronger connections than occasional big events.

**Pro Tip**: Lead by example. Leadership should be the first to give recognition, share stories that illustrate values, and participate in team rituals. Culture cascades from the top - your actions speak louder than any poster or email.
