# Best Practices & Standards Documentation Framework Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive frameworks for documenting organizational standards, guidelines, procedures, best practices, and operational excellence initiatives across various business functions and industries.

## Quick Start

**Get started in 3 minutes:**

1. **Identify Standards Scope** - Define organization type, industry sector, business function, and regulatory requirements
2. **Establish Taxonomy** - Create standards hierarchy (corporate, functional, process, work instructions levels)
3. **Develop Core Standards** - Document mandatory standards first, then recommended and optional guidelines
4. **Setup Governance** - Create standards governance board, approval process, and compliance monitoring approach

**Minimum Viable Standards Program:**
- 1 standards program overview with clear mission
- 3-5 critical mandatory standards documented
- 1 approval workflow for new/updated standards
- 1 compliance monitoring method (quarterly reviews or audits)

Perfect for: Quality managers, compliance officers, process improvement specialists, and organizational excellence consultants.
