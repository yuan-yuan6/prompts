# Regulatory Compliance Readiness Assessment - Part 1: Foundation & Governance

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build the foundation of a regulatory compliance program across six dimensions: Governance & Decision Rights, Policies & Procedures, Roles & Resourcing, Culture & Training, Risk Assessment Baseline, and Documentation & Evidence. Identify gaps and produce a concrete foundation roadmap.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **regulatory compliance foundation readiness** for **[ORGANIZATION]** in **[INDUSTRY]** operating across **[JURISDICTIONS]** under **[CORE_REGULATIONS]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Governance**—are oversight, decision rights, and three lines of defense defined? (2) **Policies/procedures**—is there a controlled policy lifecycle and minimum standards? (3) **Roles/resources**—are ownership, SMEs, and capacity adequate? (4) **Culture/training**—is leadership commitment visible and training role-based? (5) **Baseline risk assessment**—is there a workable risk taxonomy and initial risk register? (6) **Evidence**—is documentation/audit trail defined (approvals, training, controls)? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day foundation plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Conduct a compliance foundation readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating across {JURISDICTIONS} under {CORE_REGULATIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. GOVERNANCE & DECISION RIGHTS READINESS**
- Board/executive oversight is defined (charters, cadence, reporting)
- Three lines of defense model is explicit (roles and boundaries)
- Decision rights are clear (policy approvals, exceptions, risk acceptance)
- Escalation paths are fast and documented
- Accountability is defined for business owners and control owners

**2. POLICIES & PROCEDURES READINESS**
- Policy hierarchy and standards exist (policy → standard → procedure)
- Policy lifecycle is controlled (draft, review, approve, publish, train, attest)
- Minimum content requirements exist (scope, roles, controls, exceptions)
- Procedures are usable (step-by-step, control points, evidence requirements)
- Version control and periodic review are enforced

**3. ROLES, RESOURCING & CAPABILITY READINESS**
- Compliance leadership role has authority and access
- SME coverage exists for key regulatory domains
- Business unit compliance coordination model is defined
- Resource model is realistic (headcount, budget, tooling)
- Outside counsel/advisor strategy exists where needed

**4. CULTURE, TRAINING & COMMUNICATION READINESS**
- Leadership expectations are explicit (tone, incentives, consequences)
- Role-based training exists (executives, managers, frontline, specialists)
- Policy acknowledgment and training completion are tracked
- Speak-up and incident reporting mechanisms exist
- Communications cadence supports adoption (not just annual training)

**5. BASELINE RISK ASSESSMENT READINESS**
- Initial compliance risk taxonomy exists (themes, obligations, processes)
- Basic risk scoring approach exists (impact, likelihood, velocity)
- A first-pass risk register is created with owners and mitigations
- Control mapping approach is defined (process → risk → control)
- Risk appetite/tolerance is translated into operating guardrails

**6. DOCUMENTATION, EVIDENCE & RECORDKEEPING READINESS**
- Evidence standards exist (what to keep, where, retention, access)
- Audit trail exists for approvals, exceptions, training, and controls
- Document repository structure is defined and searchable
- Regulatory exam readiness basics exist (who responds, how evidence is produced)
- Metrics definitions are consistent (what is measured and how)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 foundation priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **OPERATING MODEL** - Three lines of defense, decision rights, escalation map
4. **FOUNDATION GAP LIST** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency
5. **90-DAY PLAN** - Sequenced actions to stand up governance, policies, training, and baseline risk register
6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Baselines and targets (policy coverage, training completion, exam readiness)

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, unclear accountability, limited documentation)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some policies and roles, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable governance and policy lifecycle)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured adoption and evidence discipline)
- 5.0: Optimized (high reliability, continuous improvement, strong culture)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "Regional Community Bank" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "Banking" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US (multi-state)" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary regulatory regimes | "BSA/AML, consumer protection, privacy" |

## Example

**Banking - Compliance Foundation**

> Assess regulatory compliance foundation readiness for **Regional Community Bank** in **banking** across **US (multi-state)** under **BSA/AML, consumer protection, privacy**. Governance exists but decision rights for exceptions are unclear; policies exist but lifecycle controls and procedure evidence are inconsistent; compliance resourcing is thin for privacy and third-party oversight; training is annual-only with limited role specificity; risk register exists but is not mapped to controls; exam evidence retrieval is manual. Provide scorecard and a 90-day plan to formalize decision rights, policy lifecycle controls, baseline risk/control mapping, and evidence standards.
