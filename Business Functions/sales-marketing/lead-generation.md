# Lead Generation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to generate qualified leads consistently through clear ICP targeting, channel strategy, offer design, nurture workflows, and measurable pipeline outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess lead generation readiness for [COMPANY_TYPE] targeting [TARGET_MARKET] with budget [BUDGET] and goal [LEAD_TARGET] qualified leads/month. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) ICP & targeting, (2) Offers & messaging, (3) Channel strategy & execution, (4) Funnel ops & nurture, (5) Sales–marketing alignment, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) ICP & Targeting
- 1 — Initial: ICP is unclear; targeting is broad; lead quality is unpredictable.
- 3 — Defined: ICP and personas documented; target segments prioritized; qualification assumptions explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Targeting is refined by performance; segments are operationalized across channels and teams.

### 2) Offers & Messaging
- 1 — Initial: Offers are generic; weak differentiation; message-match breaks across funnel.
- 3 — Defined: Offers mapped to funnel stages; proof points and CTAs defined; messaging guidelines exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Offer strategy is segmented; proof is strong; consistent message architecture improves conversion.

### 3) Channel Strategy & Execution
- 1 — Initial: Channels are chosen opportunistically; execution is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Channel mix tied to ICP behavior; budget and cadence planned; playbooks exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Channel performance is managed actively; creative and targeting iterate rapidly; scale is repeatable.

### 4) Funnel Ops & Nurture
- 1 — Initial: Handoffs are ad-hoc; no consistent nurture; leads stall.
- 3 — Defined: MQL/SQL definitions; nurture sequences; routing rules; basic automation.
- 5 — Optimized: Lifecycle orchestration across channels; event-driven nurture; friction points measured and improved.

### 5) Sales–Marketing Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Disagreement on lead quality; SLAs unclear; feedback loops missing.
- 3 — Defined: SLAs and definitions; feedback cadence; shared pipeline goals.
- 5 — Optimized: Tight alignment; closed-loop feedback improves targeting and offers; forecasting is more reliable.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Metrics focus on volume; attribution unclear; learnings not captured.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework (CPL, CVR, pipeline); dashboards; experiment cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization is continuous; learnings repository; measurement focuses on pipeline and revenue outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Lead generation readiness scorecard with top gaps
- ICP and targeting brief (segments, personas, disqualifiers)
- Offer and messaging map by funnel stage
- Channel plan with budget, cadence, and asset inventory
- Nurture and routing workflow (definitions, SLAs)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [COMPANY_TYPE]: Organization type
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Primary segment
- [BUDGET]: Monthly budget
- [LEAD_TARGET]: Qualified leads/month
- [LEAD_CHANNELS]: Channels (search, paid social, events, outbound, partners)
- [PIPELINE_VALUE]: Pipeline target

## Example (Condensed)
- Company: B2B consulting firm
- Scores (1–5): ICP 3; Offers 2; Channels 3; Funnel Ops 2; Alignment 2; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Weak nurture; unclear SLAs; limited experimentation tied to pipeline
- 90-day priorities: Define MQL/SQL and SLAs; implement nurture sequences; establish weekly optimization cadence
