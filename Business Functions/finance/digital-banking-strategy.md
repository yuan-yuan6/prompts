# Digital Banking Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your institution is to modernize digital channels and deliver measurable improvements in adoption, customer experience, reliability, and cost-to-serve.

## Quick Prompt
Assess digital banking readiness for [INSTITUTION_NAME] serving [CUSTOMER_BASE] with [CURRENT_DIGITAL_ADOPTION]. Evaluate customer experience and journey performance, platform and integration capabilities, data/analytics and AI enablement, security and fraud controls, delivery operating model and governance, and measurement and continuous improvement. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Customer Experience & Journey Outcomes
- 1: Journeys are fragmented; pain points are anecdotal; drop-off is not measured.
- 3: Key journeys are mapped; some metrics exist (NPS/CSAT/app rating).
- 5: End-to-end journey ownership with measurable targets and experiment cadence.

2) Channel Product Capability (Mobile/Web/Service)
- 1: Feature set is basic; parity gaps are common; releases are slow.
- 3: Core capabilities exist; roadmap is defined; some self-service.
- 5: Modular capability roadmap with clear standards and consistent releases.

3) Platform, APIs & Integration
- 1: Core constraints dominate; integrations are point-to-point and brittle.
- 3: API layer exists; integrations are improving; some eventing.
- 5: Stable APIs, clear domain ownership, and reliable integration patterns.

4) Data, Analytics & AI Enablement
- 1: Reporting is manual; data quality is inconsistent; personalization is minimal.
- 3: Standard dashboards exist; some segmentation and experimentation.
- 5: Trusted data, real-time signals where needed, and governed AI use cases.

5) Security, Fraud & Resilience
- 1: Controls are inconsistent; incidents are handled reactively.
- 3: Baseline controls and monitoring exist; periodic testing.
- 5: Strong auth, fraud controls, tested incident response, and resilience targets.

6) Delivery Operating Model & Governance
- 1: Ownership is unclear; initiatives compete; benefits are not tracked.
- 3: Governance exists; delivery is improving; benefits tracking is partial.
- 5: Clear decision rights, prioritization, and value tracking across teams.

## Deliverables
- Current-state assessment (journeys, platform, data, security, operating model)
- Prioritized initiative list (top 5) with measurable outcomes and dependencies
- Target-state capability map (channels, APIs, data, security)
- KPI scorecard and reporting cadence (adoption, satisfaction, reliability, cost)
- Delivery governance (decision rights, funding model, escalation)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — channel issues handled case-by-case.
- Level 2: Documented — roadmap exists; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — consistent delivery for major journeys.
- Level 4: Managed — measurable outcomes, reliable platform, disciplined governance.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement and experimentation loops.

## Variables
- [INSTITUTION_NAME]
- [INSTITUTION_TYPE]
- [CUSTOMER_BASE]
- [CURRENT_DIGITAL_ADOPTION]
- [TARGET_OUTCOMES]
- [CORE_BANKING_API]
- [SECURITY_POSTURE]
- [DELIVERY_TIMELINE]

## Example (Condensed)
Retail bank with low mobile ratings and high call-center volume.
- Focus: improve top 3 journeys (login, bill pay, disputes) and reduce contact rate.
- Platform: stabilize APIs and eventing for real-time notifications.
- Controls: strengthen auth and fraud monitoring; test incident response quarterly.
