# Course Content & Curriculum Mapper

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive course content, organize curriculum with clear learning progressions, and create a detailed curriculum map that aligns content with learning objectives.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: A structured approach to organizing course content and creating a curriculum map

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and duration
- Learning objectives from your course foundations
- List of topics to cover
- Student academic level

**5-minute starter**:
1. List all major topics you need to cover in your course
2. For each topic, note: essential concepts, estimated time needed, and prerequisites
3. Arrange topics in a logical sequence from foundational to advanced
4. Create a simple week-by-week outline showing progression
5. Identify where each learning objective is addressed

**Common first use**: "Help me create a curriculum map for 'Introduction to Psychology' - 15 weeks, undergraduate level. Core topics: research methods, biological psychology, development, learning, memory, social psychology. Learning objectives include understanding major theories, applying concepts to real life, and evaluating research."

**Expected output**: A comprehensive curriculum map showing weekly topics, learning progressions, content types, activities, and assessments aligned with objectives - plus guidance on instructional materials and sequencing rationale.

**Best for**: Organizing new courses, redesigning existing courses for better flow, aligning content with learning outcomes, planning multi-modal instructional materials.

## Template

```
You are an expert curriculum developer with deep knowledge of content organization, learning progressions, and instructional material design. Help me develop the curriculum and content strategy for my course.

### Course Information
- Course Title: [COURSE_NAME]
- Duration: [DURATION]
- Learning Objectives: [KEY_OBJECTIVES]
- Student Level: [LEVEL]

### Content Scope
- Core Topics: [TOPICS]
- Depth vs. Breadth Priority: [PRIORITY]
- Required Coverage: [REQUIRED_CONTENT]
- Optional Enrichment Areas: [OPTIONAL_CONTENT]

### Instructional Approach
- Primary Teaching Methods: [METHODS]
- Available Resources: [RESOURCES]
- Content Delivery Format: [FORMAT]

Generate a comprehensive curriculum development plan:

## 1. CURRICULUM MAPPING

### Content Scope Definition
Create a complete curriculum map showing:

**Week/Module** | **Topic** | **Learning Objectives** | **Content Type** | **Activities** | **Assessment**

For each module:
- Essential knowledge and concepts
- Core skills to practice
- Depth of coverage (introductory/intermediate/advanced)
- Connections to other modules
- Prerequisites required
- Estimated time allocation

### Learning Progression Design
Map the learning journey showing:
- **Foundation Building** (Weeks 1-X): Entry-level concepts and basic skills
- **Skill Development** (Weeks X-Y): Application and practice with increasing complexity
- **Integration & Synthesis** (Weeks Y-Z): Advanced application and creative problem-solving
- **Capstone/Demonstration** (Week Z): Culminating project or comprehensive assessment

Identify:
- Critical prerequisite knowledge for each module
- How complexity increases throughout the course
- Review and reinforcement checkpoints
- Opportunities for remediation or acceleration

## 2. CONTENT ORGANIZATION STRATEGY

### Module Structure Template
For each module/unit, specify:

**Module [X]: [Title]**
- **Learning Outcomes**: What students will be able to do
- **Essential Questions**: 2-3 driving questions for the module
- **Key Concepts**: Core ideas and terminology
- **Skills Practiced**: Specific competencies developed
- **Content Components**:
  - Lectures/Presentations (topics and duration)
  - Readings (with purpose and page length)
  - Videos/Media (with description)
  - Activities/Exercises (with time estimates)
- **Formative Assessments**: Check-ins and practice
- **Module Assessment**: How learning is evaluated
- **Time Required**: Student workload estimate

### Content Sequencing Logic
Explain the rationale for content order:
- Why topics appear in this sequence
- How each module builds on previous learning
- Where spiral learning (revisiting concepts) occurs
- Flexibility points where order could vary
- Dependencies that must be maintained

## 3. INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL DESIGN

### Content Creation Plan
Specify what needs to be created:

**Text-Based Content**:
- Lecture notes/presentations: [Topics and length]
- Reading guides with learning prompts
- Study guides and summaries
- Handouts and reference materials

**Visual Content**:
- Diagrams, flowcharts, infographics: [What concepts need visualization]
- Slide presentations: [Key topics]
- Visual examples and case studies

**Video/Audio Content**:
- Instructional videos: [Topics, length, and purpose]
- Demonstrations or tutorials
- Guest speaker interviews
- Podcast-style content (if applicable)

**Interactive Content**:
- Simulations or virtual labs: [What processes/concepts]
- Case studies with decision points
- Problem sets with scaffolding
- Interactive tutorials or modules

### Multi-Modal Resource Strategy
For key concepts, provide content in multiple formats to support different learners:
- Visual learners: diagrams, videos, color-coding
- Auditory learners: recorded lectures, discussions, podcasts
- Reading/writing learners: detailed notes, articles, writing prompts
- Kinesthetic learners: hands-on activities, simulations, labs

## 4. LEARNING ACTIVITIES INTEGRATION

### Active Learning Activities
Design activities for each module:

**Individual Activities**:
- Reflective writing prompts
- Problem-solving exercises
- Research tasks
- Practice quizzes
- Journal entries

**Collaborative Activities**:
- Small group discussions (with discussion prompts)
- Team projects (with roles and deliverables)
- Peer review exercises
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Group presentations

**Experiential Activities**:
- Case study analysis
- Real-world applications
- Field observations or site visits
- Guest speaker interactions
- Service learning projects (if applicable)

### Practice and Application
For each key skill, design:
- **Guided Practice**: Structured exercises with support
- **Independent Practice**: Students apply skills autonomously
- **Transfer Activities**: Apply learning to new contexts
- **Real-World Projects**: Authentic application opportunities

## 5. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Required Materials
List essential resources:
- Textbooks or required readings (with specific chapters)
- Online resources and databases
- Software or technology tools
- Equipment or supplies (for hands-on courses)
- Access to facilities or labs

### Supplementary Resources
Provide optional enrichment:
- Additional reading recommendations
- Video tutorials or demonstrations
- Practice problem banks
- Reference websites or tools

### Accessibility Considerations
Ensure all content is:
- Available in multiple formats (text, audio, video)
- Accessible to screen readers
- Clear and understandable (reading level appropriate)
- Culturally responsive and inclusive
- Available offline or with low bandwidth options (if online)

## 6. CONTENT QUALITY CHECKLIST

Verify that the curriculum:
- Aligns directly with stated learning objectives
- Provides clear progression from simple to complex
- Includes diverse perspectives and examples
- Balances theory with practical application
- Incorporates current and relevant information
- Supports multiple learning preferences
- Includes regular formative assessment opportunities
- Allows for flexibility and student choice where appropriate
- Integrates review and reinforcement strategically
- Prepares students for summative assessments
