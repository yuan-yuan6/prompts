# Board Reporting & Governance Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to produce **board-ready reporting** that is decision-oriented, evidence-backed, risk-aware, and packaged for efficient governance. Use this to diagnose gaps, prioritize improvements, and standardize board communications.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **board reporting readiness** for {BOARD_CONTEXT}. The goal is {OUTCOMES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score maturity (1–5) across the six dimensions below, then produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a board reporting & governance readiness assessment for {BOARD_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Provide evidence-based findings and specific improvements.

**1) DECISION CLARITY**
- Decisions required vs. “FYI” content clearly separated
- Asks are explicit (owner, recommendation, options, tradeoffs)
- Decision rights and approvals aligned to board/committee charters
- Pre-read vs. live discussion time optimized for decisions

**2) NARRATIVE & EXECUTIVE STORY**
- Executive summary highlights what changed and why it matters
- Strategic storyline connects KPIs → initiatives → risks → outlook
- Assumptions and uncertainties stated plainly
- Consistent terminology and definitions across the pack

**3) METRICS, DATA QUALITY & INSIGHT**
- KPIs are relevant, stable, and tied to strategy and oversight
- Data sources are credible, timely, and explainable
- Trends, drivers, and variance explanations are clear
- Leading indicators and forward-looking view included where appropriate

**4) RISK, COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE SIGNAL**
- Top risks are prioritized with ownership and mitigation status
- Risk appetite / thresholds are defined and referenced
- Compliance and control status is reported succinctly
- Issues, incidents, and audit findings are summarized with actions

**5) OPERATING MODEL (CADENCE & WORKFLOW)**
- Calendar, deadlines, and review workflow are defined and repeatable
- Inputs are coordinated across functions; version control is reliable
- Review roles are clear (author, reviewer, approver)
- Board portal/distribution process is secure and consistent

**6) PACKAGING & Q&A READINESS**
- Visuals are board-appropriate (few charts, high signal, readable)
- Appendices exist for deep dives without cluttering the narrative
- Q&A prep: anticipated questions and crisp responses are ready
- Meeting facilitation plan (timeboxes, discussion prompts) is prepared

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level and key implications
- Top 3 improvements to implement next

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **BOARD PACK BLUEPRINT**
- Proposed structure (sections + 1-line intent each)
- What goes in pre-read vs. live meeting materials

4) **DECISION & ASK REGISTER**
- For the upcoming cycle: decisions required, recommendation, options, owner, deadline

5) **RISK & ASSURANCE SNAPSHOT**
- Top risks, controls/compliance highlights, and open issues (with owners)

6) **30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- Actions, owners, dependencies, and success metrics

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad hoc, inconsistent, high rework)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some structure, gaps in clarity and evidence)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable, solid baseline, scaling friction)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (measured, reliable, continuously improving)
- 5.0: Optimized (decision-grade, low friction, high trust)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {BOARD_CONTEXT}: Board/committee setup, reporting period, key topics, decision needs
- {OUTCOMES}: What “good” looks like (e.g., faster decisions, clearer oversight)
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Time, data, tools, confidentiality, formatting, and resourcing limits

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {BOARD_CONTEXT}: Quarterly board meeting for a B2B SaaS company (9 directors, audit + compensation committees). Reporting period: Q3. Decisions needed: approve revised Q4 forecast and authorize $2.5M security investment knowing churn increased in September.
- {OUTCOMES}: Deliver a board pack that enables two decisions in 45 minutes, improves trust in churn drivers, and makes risk status easy to scan.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Two business days to finalize; metrics come from Salesforce + Stripe; legal requires redaction of one enterprise customer name; board portal supports PDF only.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.8 (Developing)
- Top 3 improvements: (1) Separate “Decisions Required” from FYI, (2) standardize KPI definitions and variance drivers, (3) add a one-page risk & assurance snapshot.

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Decision Clarity: 2/5 — asks are implied; options/tradeoffs missing
- Narrative & Executive Story: 3/5 — storyline exists but assumptions not explicit
- Metrics & Insight: 2/5 — churn is reported but drivers are not decomposed
- Risk & Governance Signal: 3/5 — security risk is covered; control status is scattered
- Operating Model: 3/5 — cadence exists; reviews are late and duplicative
- Packaging & Q&A Readiness: 4/5 — visuals readable; Q&A prep is strong

**3) BOARD PACK BLUEPRINT**
- Section 1: One-page “Decisions Required” (forecast revision, security investment)
- Section 2: Executive summary (what changed since last quarter, key drivers)
- Section 3: Financial performance (ARR, churn, CAC, burn; vs plan with drivers)
- Section 4: Strategic initiatives (3 initiatives, milestones, risks, next-quarter outcomes)
- Section 5: Risk & assurance snapshot (top risks, mitigations, control highlights)
- Appendices: customer cohort churn analysis; pipeline quality detail
- Pre-read: full blueprint; Live meeting: Decisions + 3 visuals (churn, forecast, risk)

**4) DECISION & ASK REGISTER**
- Approve revised Q4 forecast: Recommend lowering net-new ARR by 8% due to churn spike; options (hold plan, cut spend, increase retention investment); owner CFO; deadline meeting day
- Authorize $2.5M security investment: Recommend phase 1 now; options (full now vs staged); owner CISO; deadline meeting day

**5) RISK & ASSURANCE SNAPSHOT**
- Top risks: (1) Churn concentration in mid-market segment (owner CRO), (2) security posture gap before SOC2 renewal (owner CISO)
- Assurance highlights: SOC2 renewal on track; one high-severity audit issue open (vendor access reviews), remediation due in 30 days

**6) 30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- 30 days: KPI dictionary + variance driver template (owner FP&A); metric success = churn driver breakdown in every report
- 60 days: Standard board pack outline + decision register process (owner Chief of Staff)
- 90 days: Risk appetite thresholds for churn and security (owners CRO/CISO; approved by audit committee)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Start every pack with “Decisions Required” and “What changed since last time”.
2) Treat each chart as an argument: label the takeaway, not just the metric.
3) Use stable KPI definitions; if a KPI changes, explain the break explicitly.
4) Separate board oversight from management operational detail; push depth to appendices.
5) Show drivers knowing uncertainty: assumptions, sensitivity, and confidence level.
6) Report risks with owners, mitigations, and time-bound status—not narratives.
7) Build a repeatable workflow: deadlines, review roles, and version control.
8) Pre-brief key committee chairs on complex decisions to reduce meeting friction.
