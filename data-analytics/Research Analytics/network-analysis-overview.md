# Network Analysis - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This is a navigation hub for the network analysis template collection. The comprehensive network analysis template has been split into focused sub-prompts for easier use and better clarity.

## Quick Start

**Choose Your Template:**

Browse the specialized templates below and select the one that matches your specific needs. Each template is focused, easy to use, and can be applied independently.

### 1. Network Centrality Analysis Template
**File:** `network-centrality-analysis.md`

**Purpose:** Analyze network centrality and node importance using degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, and PageRank to identify influential nodes and network hubs.

**Best for:** Centrality, Degree, Betweenness

---

### 2. Network Community Detection Template
**File:** `network-community-detection.md`

**Purpose:** Detect and analyze communities in networks using modularity optimization, hierarchical clustering, label propagation, and Louvain algorithm to identify network structures.

**Best for:** Community, Modularity, Clustering

---

### 3. Network Path & Connectivity Analysis Template
**File:** `network-path-analysis.md`

**Purpose:** Analyze network paths, connectivity, and information flow using shortest path algorithms, network diameter, and reachability analysis to understand network topology.

**Best for:** Path, Shortest Path, Connectivity

---

### 4. Temporal Network Analysis Template
**File:** `network-temporal-analysis.md`

**Purpose:** Analyze dynamic and temporal networks to understand evolution, growth patterns, link prediction, and time-varying network properties.
