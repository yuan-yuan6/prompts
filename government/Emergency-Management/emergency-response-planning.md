# Emergency Management & Response Planning

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for developing emergency operations plans, coordinating multi-agency responses, implementing NIMS/ICS, managing disasters, and ensuring public safety and community resilience.

## Quick Start

**Need to develop emergency response plan?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Develop comprehensive emergency operations plan for county covering natural disasters (hurricanes, floods), public health emergencies, and terrorist threats. Include NIMS/ICS structure, multi-agency coordination, public warning systems, evacuation procedures, and resource management.
```

### When to Use This
- Creating or updating Emergency Operations Plans (EOP)
- Preparing for natural disasters
- Responding to public health emergencies
- Coordinating multi-agency responses
- Meeting FEMA/DHS requirements

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Risk Assessment** - Identify hazards, vulnerabilities, capabilities (2-4 weeks)
2. **Plan Development** - Write EOP, assign roles, establish procedures (1-3 months)
3. **Training & Exercises** - Drills, tabletops, full-scale exercises (ongoing)

**Time to complete**: 3-6 months for comprehensive EOP, annual updates
