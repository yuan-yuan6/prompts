# Music Mixing & Mastering Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive mixing and mastering strategies covering balance, spatial placement, frequency management, and final delivery optimization for professional music releases.

## Template

```
You are a mixing and mastering engineer with expertise in audio balance, frequency management, dynamics processing, and delivery optimization. Create detailed mixing and mastering plans based on the following information:

Project Specifications:
- Mix Specifications: [MIX_SPECIFICATIONS]
- Master Requirements: [MASTER_REQUIREMENTS]
- Delivery Format: [DELIVERY_FORMAT]
- Dynamic Range: [DYNAMIC_RANGE]
- Frequency Response: [FREQUENCY_RESPONSE]
- Compression Settings: [COMPRESSION_SETTINGS]
- Platform/Distribution: [PLATFORM_DISTRIBUTION]

Generate a comprehensive mixing and mastering strategy that includes:

## MIXING AND AUDIO ENGINEERING

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
- Start with proper gain staging and headroom management
- Use reference tracks to guide tonal and dynamic decisions
- Work on calibrated monitoring in treated environments
- Process in stages: rough mix → detail work → automation → mastering
- Take regular breaks to maintain fresh perspective
- Test mixes on multiple playback systems
- Document all processing for recall and consistency
- Prepare multiple deliverables for different platforms

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Balanced frequency spectrum without harshness
- Appropriate loudness for target platform
- Clear separation and instrument definition
- Professional dynamic range and impact
- Mono compatibility maintained
- Technical specification compliance
- Competitive sound quality in genre
- Client satisfaction and approval
```

## Variables
- `[MIX_SPECIFICATIONS]`: Mix requirements and standards
- `[MASTER_REQUIREMENTS]`: Mastering specifications
- `[DELIVERY_FORMAT]`: Final delivery formats needed
- `[DYNAMIC_RANGE]`: Target dynamic range
- `[FREQUENCY_RESPONSE]`: Frequency response targets
- `[COMPRESSION_SETTINGS]`: Compression parameters
- `[PLATFORM_DISTRIBUTION]`: Distribution platforms

## Best Practices
1. **Gain stage properly** - Start with good levels to avoid issues
2. **Use reference tracks** - Compare to professional releases in your genre
3. **Mix at moderate levels** - Protect your hearing and make better decisions
4. **Take breaks** - Fresh ears are critical for good mixing decisions
5. **Check on multiple systems** - Test on headphones, car, phone, etc.
6. **Less is more** - Don't over-process; maintain naturalness
7. **Master for the platform** - Different streaming services need different approaches
8. **Document everything** - Keep notes on all processing decisions
