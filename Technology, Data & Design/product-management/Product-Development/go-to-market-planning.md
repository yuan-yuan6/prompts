# Go-to-Market Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess an organization's readiness to execute successful product launches through effective go-to-market strategies, coordinated cross-functional execution, and systematic customer acquisition. This framework evaluates capabilities across Market Understanding, Positioning & Messaging, Channel Strategy, Sales & Marketing Execution, Customer Success, and Launch Operations, identifying gaps that cause failed launches and providing actionable roadmaps for building GTM maturity.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive go-to-market readiness assessment for {PRODUCT_NAME}, targeting {TARGET_MARKET} with {GTM_MOTION}.

Assess GTM capability across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. MARKET UNDERSTANDING & CUSTOMER DEFINITION**
Assess whether the organization has developed deep understanding of target markets and customers by evaluating whether the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is precisely defined with specific firmographics for B2B (company size, industry, geography, technology stack, maturity stage) or demographics and psychographics for B2C (age, income, behaviors, values, technology adoption) rather than vague descriptions like "mid-market companies" or "tech-savvy consumers," whether buyer personas are detailed and evidence-based covering economic buyers, technical buyers, and end users with their respective goals, pain points, decision criteria, and common objections rather than superficial demographic sketches, whether the buying process is mapped showing who is involved in decisions, typical sales cycle length, budget cycles, approval workflows, and evaluation criteria enabling sales and marketing to align to actual customer behavior, whether market opportunity is quantified with credible TAM/SAM/SOM analysis showing addressable market size, growth rates, and realistic capture targets grounded in bottoms-up analysis rather than top-down wishful thinking, whether competitive landscape is thoroughly understood including direct competitors' positioning and GTM strategies, indirect alternatives and substitutes, competitive advantages and proof points, and realistic assessment of where you win versus where competitors have advantage, whether market dynamics are analyzed covering trends driving opportunity, technology enablers creating timing advantage, regulatory factors affecting adoption, and economic conditions influencing buying behavior, and whether customer validation has occurred through customer discovery interviews, beta customer commitments, pilot results, or other evidence that target customers actually have the problem you claim and will pay for your solution.

**2. POSITIONING, MESSAGING & VALUE ARTICULATION**
Evaluate whether the organization can clearly articulate differentiated value by assessing whether positioning is sharp and defensible with a clear positioning statement defining target customer, need addressed, category, key benefit, and primary differentiator that creates meaningful separation from alternatives, whether the value proposition is compelling across functional value (what it does, tangible outcomes, efficiency gains), emotional value (how it makes users feel, status conferred, risk reduced), and economic value (ROI, payback period, quantified benefit) rather than generic claims about being "better" or "easier," whether messaging framework is comprehensive including memorable tagline, concise elevator pitch, simple one-liner for non-technical audiences, and 3-5 key messages with supporting proof points that can be consistently deployed across channels, whether messaging is tailored by audience with customized messages for each buyer persona addressing their specific priorities, pain points, and decision criteria rather than one-size-fits-all communication, whether differentiation is clear and provable explaining specifically what you do differently from competitors and why that matters to customers backed by evidence and customer validation, whether objection handling is prepared with documented common objections and effective responses enabling sales and marketing teams to address concerns confidently, and whether messaging has been validated with target customers through message testing, customer interviews, or beta feedback ensuring messages resonate and aren't just internally compelling.

**3. CHANNEL STRATEGY & CUSTOMER ACQUISITION**
Determine whether the organization has identified and validated effective customer acquisition channels by evaluating whether the GTM motion aligns with product economics and customer behavior choosing between sales-led for high ACV complex sales, product-led for low friction self-serve adoption, or hybrid approaches based on segment rather than defaulting to familiar models, whether awareness channels are identified and sized covering where target customers discover solutions including organic search, paid advertising, content marketing, events, partnerships, word-of-mouth, and community with realistic reach and cost estimates per channel, whether acquisition channels have proven conversion paths showing how awareness converts to leads, leads to qualified opportunities, and opportunities to customers with understood conversion rates and CAC by channel, whether channel mix is coherent with appropriate balance between owned channels (content, SEO, community) for sustainable growth, paid channels (SEM, social ads, display) for speed and scale, and partner channels (integrations, resellers, affiliates) for reach and credibility rather than scattering effort across too many unproven channels, whether customer acquisition costs are understood by channel with validated CAC, payback period, and LTV:CAC ratios informing channel investment decisions, whether early channel validation has occurred through small tests or pilots proving that target customers can be reached and acquired through proposed channels at acceptable costs before committing full launch budgets, and whether there's realistic assessment of channel maturity understanding which channels require 3-6 months to mature (SEO, content marketing, community) versus quick results (paid ads, direct sales) informing launch timing and expectations.

**4. SALES & MARKETING EXECUTION READINESS**
Assess whether sales and marketing teams have the capabilities, materials, and processes needed to execute by evaluating whether sales strategy is well-defined including sales model (inside, field, or hybrid), organizational structure, territory design, quota setting, and compensation plans aligned to GTM objectives, whether sales enablement is comprehensive covering pitch decks with compelling storytelling and objection handling, battle cards with competitive intelligence and win strategies, demo environments showcasing key value, ROI calculators quantifying customer value, case studies and proof points, sales process documentation, and training programs ensuring reps can effectively sell, whether marketing campaigns are ready with content calendar planned, creative assets developed, campaign budgets allocated, marketing automation configured, landing pages optimized for conversion, and measurement frameworks in place to track performance, whether demand generation strategy is sound covering content marketing with educational and thought leadership assets, paid advertising with targeting and creative ready, email marketing with segmentation and nurture sequences, events and webinars with speaker and logistics arranged, SEO with keyword strategy and content priorities, and PR with press strategy and media relationships activated, whether go-to-market is appropriately staffed with adequate sales headcount to cover territories and achieve quota, marketing resources across demand gen, content, and product marketing, customer success capacity to onboard and support new customers, and sales development representatives if using outbound motions, whether there's collaboration between sales and marketing with lead handoff processes defined, lead qualification criteria agreed, feedback loops established, and shared accountability for pipeline and revenue targets, and whether pilot or early customer success exists providing proof that sales and marketing motions work before scaling investment.

**5. CUSTOMER SUCCESS & RETENTION READINESS**
Evaluate whether the organization can successfully onboard, activate, and retain acquired customers by assessing whether onboarding strategy is designed for rapid time-to-value with clear success criteria defining what "activated" means, structured onboarding timeline with touchpoints and milestones, resources including documentation, videos, templates, and training materials, and success metrics tracking activation rate and time to activation, whether customer success model matches customer segments with high-touch CSMs for enterprise customers with strategic importance, low-touch scaled CS for mid-market using a mix of human and digital, and tech-touch automation for SMB customers with self-serve resources and automated engagement, whether customer health is measurable through health scoring covering product usage, feature adoption, engagement frequency, support interactions, and sentiment enabling proactive intervention before churn risk escalates, whether there are defined expansion plays including upsell paths to higher tiers or modules, cross-sell opportunities for additional products, and triggers indicating readiness for expansion enabling revenue growth beyond initial acquisition, whether retention is prioritized with clear retention targets, churn analysis understanding why customers leave, win-back strategies for at-risk customers, and NPS or satisfaction measurement tracking customer sentiment, whether support readiness exists with documentation covering all major use cases, support team trained on product, ticket triage and escalation processes, and SLAs appropriate to customer segments, and whether success metrics are defined tracking activation rate, feature adoption, usage frequency, retention by cohort, NPS, and expansion revenue providing visibility into post-sale success.

**6. LAUNCH OPERATIONS & CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COORDINATION**
Assess whether the organization can execute coordinated launches by evaluating whether there's a detailed launch plan with pre-launch activities (8-12 weeks before) covering positioning finalization, enablement development, beta customer recruitment, content creation, and team preparation, launch week activities including product go-live, press release distribution, customer communication, campaign activation, and war room monitoring, and post-launch activities (4-12 weeks after) covering metrics analysis, feedback integration, campaign optimization, and launch retrospective, whether cross-functional coordination is strong with clear ownership and accountability across product, marketing, sales, customer success, and support, regular coordination meetings, dependency tracking, and escalation paths when blockers arise, whether launch readiness criteria are defined with go/no-go checklist covering product quality, sales enablement, marketing readiness, support preparedness, analytics instrumentation, and executive approval preventing premature launches, whether success metrics are clearly defined with specific targets for 30-day, 90-day, and 6-month milestones covering acquisition metrics (leads, customers, CAC), activation metrics (onboarding completion, time to value), engagement metrics (usage frequency, feature adoption), revenue metrics (MRR/ARR, ACV, LTV), and retention metrics (churn rate, NRR, NPS) enabling objective evaluation of launch success, whether there's infrastructure for launch monitoring including real-time dashboards, daily stand-ups during launch week, customer feedback collection processes, issue triage and resolution, and rapid iteration capability responding to early signals, whether risk management is thorough with identified risks across product quality, market reception, competitive response, channel effectiveness, and organizational execution with mitigation strategies and contingency plans, and whether there's post-launch learning process including structured retrospectives, documentation of what worked and what didn't, sharing learnings across organization, and incorporation of insights into next launch improving GTM capability over time.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall maturity score (X.X/5.0), maturity stage classification, top 3 critical gaps preventing successful launch, recommended investment level and timeline to achieve launch readiness

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table showing each dimension with score (X.X/5.0), current state characterization, and primary gap or strength

3. **CRITICAL READINESS GAPS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by launch risk and urgency, with specific manifestations and business consequences

4. **GTM READINESS ROADMAP** - Prioritized plan for building GTM capabilities, enablement, and launch infrastructure over next 90 days

5. **QUICK WINS & LAUNCH PREP** - Immediate actions (0-2 weeks) to reduce launch risk and longer-term investments (4-12 weeks) for sustainable GTM capability

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Current baseline scores vs 30-day and 90-day target scores per dimension, with leading indicators of improved GTM readiness

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Ad-hoc (no systematic GTM, reactive launches, frequent failures)

## Usage Example

### B2B SaaS Collaboration Platform - GTM Readiness Assessment

**Context:** DataFlow is a B2B SaaS data collaboration platform targeting mid-market companies (500-2,000 employees) with distributed data teams. The product enables secure data sharing and collaborative analytics across departments. After 18 months of development with design partner customers, the company plans to launch publicly in Q1 2026 transitioning from closed beta to general availability. The team consists of 3 product managers, 25 engineers, 2 marketers, 5 salespeople, and 3 customer success managers. This assessment was commissioned after the executive team realized launch planning had been neglected while focusing on product development.

**Assessment Conducted:** December 2025 (8 weeks before planned launch)  
**Evaluated By:** CEO, VP Product, VP Sales, VP Marketing  
**Assessment Duration:** 1 week (team interviews, document review, customer feedback analysis)

#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Maturity Score: 2.2/5.0** (Developing stage, significant gaps)

DataFlow has focused intensely on product development while neglecting go-to-market preparation, creating serious launch risk. The organization lacks fundamental GTM foundations—ICP is vaguely defined as "data teams" without specificity about company profiles or buyer personas, positioning and messaging have not been crafted beyond generic statements about "secure data collaboration," customer acquisition channels are untested with no validation that target customers can be reached at acceptable CAC, sales enablement materials don't exist forcing reps to create their own decks, and no coordinated launch plan exists across product, marketing, and sales teams. The team plans to "launch and iterate" without clear success metrics or contingency plans. Launching in current state risks embarrassing failure—inability to generate pipeline, confused market reception, sales team frustration, and wasted product investment.

**Top 3 Critical Gaps:**
1. **Undefined ICP and unvalidated messaging** - Team cannot articulate who specifically they're selling to beyond "companies with data teams." No buyer persona work, no understanding of decision makers or buying process, no validated value proposition. Sales team doesn't know who to call or what to say. Marketing can't target effectively without ICP clarity.
2. **No customer acquisition strategy or channel validation** - Zero testing of how to reach and acquire customers. Assumptions about "content marketing and outbound sales" without proof these channels work. No budget allocated, no campaigns built, no demand generation engine. Will launch with no pipeline generation capability.
3. **Missing sales enablement and go-to-market coordination** - Sales team has no pitch deck, no demo script, no pricing guidance, no objection handling, no competitive intelligence. No launch plan coordinating product, marketing, sales, and CS. Each team operating independently without shared timeline or objectives.

**Recommended Investment:** $180-220K over 8-12 weeks including fractional GTM consultant to build foundations ($60K for 8 weeks), messaging and positioning workshop with external facilitator ($25K), marketing budget for channel testing ($40K), sales enablement development ($15K for materials creation), customer research and ICP validation ($20K for 30 customer interviews), and launch coordination tools and agency support ($20-40K)

**Critical Decision:** Launch date must slip 8-12 weeks to build minimum GTM foundation. Launching as planned in 8 weeks risks catastrophic failure. Alternative: soft launch to existing beta customers only while building GTM capability, then public launch when ready.

**Target Outcome:** Achieve 3.4/5.0 maturity in 12 weeks enabling clear ICP and messaging, validated acquisition channel with predictable CAC, equipped sales team with enablement materials, coordinated launch plan with defined metrics, realistic path to $2M ARR in first year

#### DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Current State | Primary Gap/Strength |
|-----------|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Market Understanding** | 2.0/5.0 | Developing | Vague ICP ("data teams"); no buyer personas; no competitive intelligence; market sizing guesses |
| **Positioning & Messaging** | 1.8/5.0 | Ad-hoc | Generic claims ("secure collaboration"); no differentiation; messaging not validated; no objection handling |
| **Channel Strategy** | 1.9/5.0 | Ad-hoc | Untested assumptions about channels; no CAC data; no channel validation; no demand gen engine |
| **Sales & Marketing Execution** | 2.3/5.0 | Developing | STRENGTH: Experienced sales reps hired; GAP: No enablement, no campaigns, no materials |
| **Customer Success** | 2.9/5.0 | Developing | STRENGTH: Good onboarding from beta; GAP: No scaled CS model, no health scoring, no expansion plays |
| **Launch Operations** | 1.7/5.0 | Ad-hoc | No launch plan; no cross-functional coordination; no metrics defined; no go/no-go criteria |

**Overall Assessment:** DataFlow exhibits classic product-first company pattern—strong product, weak GTM. The organization assumed "build it and they will come" and is now 8 weeks from launch without GTM foundations. Current state guarantees launch failure unless immediate corrective action taken. The good news: product quality is strong based on beta feedback, creating solid foundation if GTM can be fixed. The bad news: fixing GTM properly requires 8-12 weeks, meaning launch delay is necessary despite external pressure to hit dates.

#### CRITICAL READINESS GAPS

**Gap 1: No Defined ICP or Buyer Personas (Impact: Critical | Urgency: Immediate)**

**Manifestation:** When asked "who is your ideal customer?" team provides vague answers: "companies with data teams," "mid-market," "data-driven organizations." No specifics about company characteristics (industry, size, tech stack, data maturity), decision makers (titles, roles, responsibilities), buying process (who approves, budget cycles, evaluation criteria), or use cases (specific problems solved, workflows enabled). Sales team doesn't know who to target—VP of Data? CTO? Director of Analytics? Marketing can't build targeted campaigns. Product messaging is generic because team doesn't know specific customer pain points.

**Business Consequences:**
- Sales team will waste months chasing wrong prospects, burning quota time on companies that don't have the problem or can't buy
- Marketing spend will be inefficient targeting broad audiences instead of precise ICP characteristics yielding high CAC and low conversion
- Messaging will be generic and undifferentiated failing to resonate with specific buyer motivations and evaluation criteria
- Competitive losses when unable to articulate why DataFlow versus alternatives for specific buyer situations
- Extended sales cycles when targeting buyers without urgency or authority

**Root Cause:** Team focused entirely on product development with design partners who were hand-selected friendlies. Never conducted systematic customer discovery or market segmentation. Assumed product would be "obvious" to "data people." No one owns GTM strategy or customer definition.

**Recommended Action:** Immediate 3-week ICP and persona sprint: (1) Interview 30 target customers (mix of prospects, design partners, and churned/rejected) using customer discovery methodology to understand roles, problems, buying process, decision criteria; (2) Analyze customer data from beta to identify patterns in company characteristics, use cases, and engagement; (3) Develop 2-3 detailed buyer personas with goals, pain points, objections, decision criteria; (4) Define narrow ICP for initial launch (e.g., "Series B-C startups with 200-800 employees in SaaS/fintech building data products, with Chief Data Officer or VP Analytics as buyer") enabling focused targeting. Expected outcome: Clear ICP sales can target, personas marketing can message to, focused launch strategy.

**Gap 2: Unvalidated Customer Acquisition Channels (Impact: Critical | Urgency: Immediate)**

**Manifestation:** Team's acquisition "strategy" is assumptions: "We'll do content marketing and outbound sales." Zero testing of whether target customers can be reached through these channels, what messaging resonates, or what CAC will be. No content has been created, no outbound sequences tested, no ads run, no partnerships explored. Marketing budget exists ($120K for launch quarter) but no allocation across channels. No understanding of conversion funnels, lead volume required, or timeline from awareness to closed deal.

**Business Consequences:**
- Will launch with zero pipeline generation capability; no leads coming in Day 1 despite product being live
- Marketing will scramble to build campaigns post-launch wasting critical launch momentum window
- Sales team will have no leads to work, will resort to random cold calling destroying morale
- Burn rate continues with no revenue pipeline; investors will lose confidence
- Competitors executing GTM effectively will capture market while DataFlow figures out acquisition

**Root Cause:** Product-first mentality assumed customers would find product organically or through word-of-mouth from beta users. No GTM leader driving acquisition strategy. Marketing team small and overwhelmed. No testing budget or permission to experiment before "official launch."

**Recommended Action:** Immediate channel validation sprint over 4 weeks in parallel with ICP work: (1) Allocate $30K testing budget; (2) Run small paid campaign tests on LinkedIn targeting data leader titles to validate messaging and measure cost-per-lead ($10K); (3) Run outbound sequences to 500 prospects to test email messaging and meeting conversion ($5K for tools/data); (4) Publish 5 pieces of thought leadership content and run traffic campaigns to test engagement ($10K); (5) Test 3 partnership channels (integration partners, data tool communities, influencers) ($5K); (6) Measure and analyze CAC, conversion rates, sales cycle by channel; (7) Double down on 1-2 channels that show promise for launch. Expected outcome: Validated acquisition channel with proven $X CAC, conversion rates, and projected pipeline generation to hit revenue targets.

**Gap 3: No Sales Enablement or Materials (Impact: High | Urgency: Immediate)**

**Manifestation:** Sales team of 5 reps has zero enablement materials. No standard pitch deck (each rep created their own resulting in inconsistent messaging). No demo script or environment (demos are ad-hoc and inconsistent). No pricing guidance (reps quote different prices). No competitive battle cards (reps don't know how to position against competitors). No objection handling (reps individually figuring out responses). No case studies or proof points beyond design partner logos. No ROI calculator. No sales process or methodology. Rep onboarding is "shadow other reps" leading to bad habits proliferating.

**Business Consequences:**
- Inconsistent customer experience as each rep tells different story creating market confusion and undermining brand
- Lost deals when reps can't effectively handle objections, differentiate from competitors, or articulate clear ROI
- Extended sales cycles when reps lack structured process and materials to advance deals through stages
- Rep frustration and potential turnover when left unsupported and set up to fail
- Pricing leakage when reps lack guidance and discount heavily to close deals

**Root Cause:** No sales enablement function or ownership. VP Sales focused on hiring team, assumed materials would "come together" before launch. Product team assumed sales team would "figure it out." No collaboration between product and sales on messaging and positioning.

**Recommended Action:** Emergency 3-week sales enablement build: (1) Week 1: Messaging workshop with product, sales, marketing to align on positioning, value prop, key messages, differentiation resulting in master messaging document; (2) Week 2: Build core enablement assets—pitch deck (20 slides: problem, solution, demo, differentiation, pricing, next steps), demo script and demo environment, pricing and packaging guide with discounting authority, objection handling doc with top 10 objections and responses, competitive battle cards for 3 main competitors; (3) Week 3: Sales training on new materials with role-play, deal coaching on live opportunities, feedback and iteration. Hire contract enablement designer for materials ($10K). Expected outcome: Sales team armed with consistent, effective materials; improved win rates and sales cycle velocity.

**Gap 4: Generic Undifferentiated Messaging (Impact: High | Urgency: High)**

**Manifestation:** Current messaging is vague and feature-focused: "DataFlow enables secure data collaboration across teams." Website copy is generic. No clear differentiation from competitors beyond "we're better." Value proposition not quantified—claims about "improving efficiency" without specific metrics. No proof points or customer validation beyond design partner logos. Messaging hasn't been tested with target customers to validate resonance. No tailoring by persona—same message for technical buyers and business buyers.

**Business Consequences:**
- Market will be confused about what DataFlow does and why it matters; won't cut through noise
- Competitors with sharper positioning will win deals by articulating clear differentiation
- Sales cycles will extend as buyers struggle to understand value proposition requiring excessive education
- Low conversion rates on marketing campaigns when messaging doesn't resonate with specific pain points
- Difficulty generating PR or analyst attention without clear positioning hook

**Root Cause:** No dedicated product marketing function. Messaging created by product team in isolation without customer validation or competitive analysis. Assumed features would "speak for themselves." No frameworks or process for messaging development.

**Recommended Action:** 2-week positioning and messaging sprint with external facilitator: (1) Competitive positioning workshop analyzing 5 competitors' positioning, identifying white space and differentiation opportunities; (2) Customer value discovery interviewing 10 customers about specific problems solved, outcomes achieved, why they chose DataFlow over alternatives, resulting in quantified value stories; (3) Messaging framework development creating positioning statement, value proposition with quantified benefits, key messages by persona, proof points and validation; (4) Message testing with 5-10 target prospects via interviews to validate resonance and refine; (5) Messaging deployment updating website, pitch materials, campaign copy. External messaging consultant ($25K). Expected outcome: Sharp differentiated positioning validated with customers, enabling more effective sales and marketing.

**Gap 5: No Launch Coordination or Success Metrics (Impact: Medium | Urgency: High)**

**Manifestation:** No formal launch plan exists. Product team has release date in mind. Marketing team has vague ideas about "launch activities." Sales team doesn't know what's happening when. No coordination meetings or shared timeline. No defined success metrics—when asked "what does successful launch look like?" team gives conflicting answers (product: "no major bugs," sales: "10 customers," marketing: "website traffic," CEO: "$1M ARR"). No launch readiness criteria or go/no-go decision process. No contingency planning for what happens if launch doesn't go well.

**Business Consequences:**
- Uncoordinated launch where product goes live but marketing campaigns aren't ready and sales team isn't trained creating fumbled launch
- Inability to evaluate launch success objectively leading to debates about whether launch "worked" or resource allocation decisions
- Missed opportunities when different teams aren't aligned on priorities and messaging
- Difficulty pivoting or iterating when can't identify what's working versus what's not

**Root Cause:** No launch leader or program manager. Each function operating independently. No cross-functional planning process. Metrics and goals not clearly defined at company level cascading to teams.

**Recommended Action:** Immediate launch coordination actions: (1) Assign launch DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)—likely VP Product or VP Marketing; (2) Create launch timeline with milestones for each team (product, marketing, sales, CS) identifying dependencies; (3) Weekly launch coordination meeting with all stakeholders reviewing progress and blockers; (4) Define launch success metrics with specific 30-day and 90-day targets: pipeline generated (X leads, Y opportunities), customers acquired (Z new customers), revenue ($ MRR), product usage (activation rate, engagement), market awareness (website traffic, PR coverage); (5) Launch readiness checklist covering product quality, sales enablement, marketing readiness, support preparedness, analytics; (6) Go/no-go decision checkpoint 2 weeks before launch with executive review. Expected outcome: Coordinated launch with all teams aligned on timeline and objectives, clear metrics for evaluation.
