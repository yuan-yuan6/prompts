## Quick Start

Launch effective contract management operations in 4 steps:

1. **Centralize Your Contracts**: Create a searchable repository with key metadata (parties, values, terms, renewal dates, risk ratings) for all active contracts
2. **Implement Risk Tiers**: Classify contracts by risk level (critical/high/medium/low) to allocate appropriate review resources and monitoring frequency
3. **Set Up Renewal Alerts**: Configure 90-day advance alerts for contract expirations to enable proactive renegotiation and prevent auto-renewals of unfavorable terms
4. **Establish Approval Workflows**: Create clear approval paths based on contract value and risk (e.g., <$50K: manager approval; >$50K: legal + executive review)

**Pro Tip**: Focus first on high-value and high-risk contracts (top 20%) for intensive monitoring—these typically represent 80% of your financial and legal exposure.
