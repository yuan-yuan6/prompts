# User Research & Persona Development Template

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive user research and create evidence-based personas that drive product decisions, align teams around user needs, and ensure products solve real user problems effectively.

## Quick Research Prompt
Conduct user research for [product] to answer: [key question]. Method: [interviews/surveys/usability tests] with [X] participants matching [criteria]. Deliverables: research plan, interview guide (10 questions), synthesis of findings (patterns, quotes, insights), 2-3 evidence-based personas (goals, pain points, behaviors, jobs-to-be-done), and actionable recommendations for product team.

## Quick Start

**Need quick user insights?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Research Question: Why do users abandon checkout?
Method: 10 user interviews + analytics review
Key Finding: 65% abandon due to unexpected shipping costs
Persona: "Budget-Conscious Beth" - Price-sensitive online shopper, compares 3+ sites before buying
Recommendation: Show shipping costs earlier in flow, offer free shipping threshold
```

### When to Use This
- Starting new product initiatives or entering new markets
- Validating product-market fit and customer problems
- Before major product redesigns or new feature development
- When team lacks clarity on who users are and what they need
- Annual persona refresh to reflect market changes

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Define research objectives** - What you need to learn and why (1-2 days)
2. **Design research plan** - Methods, sample, timeline, questions (2-3 days)
3. **Conduct research** - Interviews, surveys, observations, data analysis (2-4 weeks)
4. **Analyze & synthesize** - Find patterns, insights, themes (1 week)
5. **Create personas & share** - Document personas and socialize findings (3-5 days)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS User Research
```
Product: Sales enablement platform
Research Question: Why do sales reps resist using our platform?
Method: 20 interviews with sales reps + 5 sales managers + usage analytics
Key Finding: Platform doesn't fit into existing workflow (Salesforce + email)
Persona: "Quota-Driven Quinn" - Enterprise sales rep, 38, needs tools that help close deals fast
Insight: Reps see platform as admin burden, not sales tool
Recommendation: Build Salesforce integration, show ROI in minutes saved per deal
```

### Example 2: Consumer App Research
```
Product: Meditation and mindfulness app
Research Question: What causes users to maintain or abandon meditation practice?
Method: 2-week diary study with 25 users + exit interviews with churned users
Key Finding: Users need accountability and variety; abandonment happens when practice becomes routine

Insight: Owners willing to pay premium for time savings and integration
Recommendation: All-in-one platform with accounting integration, automated reconciliation, mobile-first
```

## Best Practices

### Research Planning
1. **Start with clear objectives** - Know what decisions this research will inform
2. **Involve stakeholders early** - Get alignment on questions before starting
3. **Mix methods** - Combine qualitative depth with quantitative validation
4. **Recruit representative users** - Ensure sample reflects your target market
5. **Plan for synthesis time** - Analysis takes as long as data collection

### Conducting Research
1. **Ask open-ended questions** - Avoid leading questions that bias responses
2. **Listen more than talk** - 80/20 rule in interviews
3. **Probe for specifics** - Ask for examples, stories, recent experiences
4. **Observe behavior** - What people do > what they say
5. **Record and document** - Video/audio with permission, detailed notes

### Analysis & Synthesis
1. **Look for patterns** - Themes across participants, not individual opinions
2. **Quantify when possible** - How many people mentioned this?
3. **Include contradictions** - Don't ignore data that doesn't fit
4. **Separate observation from interpretation** - What they said vs what it means
5. **Involve the team** - Collaborative synthesis builds alignment

### Persona Creation
1. **Ground in data** - Every persona element backed by research
2. **Make them realistic** - Use real quotes, photos, details
3. **Focus on behaviors** - What they do matters more than demographics
4. **Show goals and pains** - Why they act the way they do
5. **Limit to 3-5 personas** - Too many = none are used

### Socialization & Use
1. **Tell stories** - Bring personas to life with narratives
2. **Make them visible** - Posters, cards, wiki pages
3. **Reference in meetings** - "What would Sarah think about this?"
4. **Update regularly** - Personas should evolve with market
5. **Connect to metrics** - Show how persona needs map to business goals

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Research without clear objectives** - Gathering data without knowing why
✅ Instead: Define key decisions and questions before starting research

❌ **Asking what users want** - "Would you use feature X?"
✅ Instead: Understand current behaviors, problems, and contexts

❌ **Too small sample sizes** - Making decisions based on 3 interviews
✅ Instead: Recruit until patterns emerge (typically 15-25 for interviews)

❌ **Confirmation bias** - Only hearing what confirms your hypothesis
✅ Instead: Actively look for disconfirming evidence

❌ **Demographic-based personas** - "Sarah, 35, lives in SF, likes yoga"
✅ Instead: Behavior-based personas focused on goals, pains, contexts

❌ **Personas that live in a drawer** - Beautiful deliverable no one uses
✅ Instead: Integrate personas into daily product decisions and meetings

❌ **One-and-done research** - Creating personas once and never updating
✅ Instead: Continuous research with quarterly persona validation

❌ **Not showing methodology** - Just conclusions without supporting evidence
✅ Instead: Show sample quotes, data, methodology to build credibility
