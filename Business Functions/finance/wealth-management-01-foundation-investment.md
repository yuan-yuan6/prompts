# Wealth Management Readiness Assessment — Foundation & Investment

## Purpose
Assess how ready you are to deliver the “foundation + investment” portion of a wealth management plan with clear goals, consistent data, an appropriate allocation, and a repeatable review cadence.

## Quick Prompt
Assess foundation and investment readiness for [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]. Evaluate goal clarity and prioritization, cash flow and balance sheet accuracy, risk tolerance and time horizon, investment policy and asset allocation, implementation and rebalancing discipline, and reporting/review cadence. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Discovery, Goals & Constraints
- 1: Goals are vague; constraints and tradeoffs are undocumented.
- 3: Goals and constraints are documented; prioritization is partial.
- 5: Goals are specific, prioritized, and translated into decision rules.

2) Cash Flow, Net Worth & Data Quality
- 1: Key accounts and liabilities are missing; numbers are not reconciled.
- 3: Core data is captured; some items require manual cleanup.
- 5: Data is complete, current, and reconciled with clear assumptions.

3) Risk Tolerance, Capacity & Time Horizon Fit
- 1: Risk profile is assumed; horizon and liquidity needs are unclear.
- 3: Basic risk profiling exists; edge cases are not fully addressed.
- 5: Risk tolerance and capacity are validated and mapped to allocation choices.

4) Investment Policy & Strategic Asset Allocation
- 1: Allocation is improvised; the “why” is unclear.
- 3: A baseline policy exists; diversification logic is mostly consistent.
- 5: IPS-level policy with target ranges, rebalancing rules, and constraints.

5) Implementation, Costs & Rebalancing Discipline
- 1: Implementation is inconsistent; fees and taxes are not considered.
- 3: Most accounts are implemented; rebalancing happens opportunistically.
- 5: Account-by-account implementation, cost discipline, and rule-based rebalancing.

6) Reporting, Reviews & Accountability
- 1: Reviews are sporadic; decisions aren’t documented.
- 3: Periodic reviews occur; action items aren’t consistently tracked.
- 5: Fixed cadence with documented decisions, owners, and follow-through.

## Deliverables
- Client discovery summary (goals, constraints, time horizon, risk profile)
- Personal balance sheet and cash flow summary (assumptions documented)
- Investment policy summary (targets, ranges, constraints, rebalancing rules)
- Allocation proposal and implementation plan (accounts, vehicles, costs)
- Review cadence and reporting pack (what to track, thresholds, actions)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent discovery and ad hoc investments.
- Level 2: Documented — plan exists; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — most clients get consistent analysis and implementation.
- Level 4: Managed — disciplined rebalancing, reporting, and accountability.
- Level 5: Optimizing — outcomes feedback improves policy and client decisions.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]
- [LIFE_STAGE]
- [GOALS_PRIORITIZED]
- [LIQUIDITY_NEEDS]
- [RISK_TOLERANCE]
- [RISK_CAPACITY]
- [CURRENT_ASSET_ALLOCATION]
- [TARGET_ALLOCATION]

## Example (Condensed)
Dual-income family building wealth.
- Goals: retirement + college + home upgrade, prioritized with timelines.
- Policy: 80/20 target with ranges, liquidity carve-out, rebalancing bands.
- Execution: automated contributions, low-cost vehicles, quarterly review cadence.
