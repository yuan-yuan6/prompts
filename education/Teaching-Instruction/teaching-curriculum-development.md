# Curriculum Development & Design Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive curriculum frameworks for educational programs, including course design, module development, learning objectives, and curriculum mapping.

## Quick Start

**Need to develop curriculum quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Create a semester-long curriculum for Introduction to Computer Science (high school level). Include: 8 units covering programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and computational thinking. Each unit: 2-week duration, clear learning objectives, hands-on coding projects, formative and summative assessments. Align with state CS standards. Include pacing guide and resource list.
```

### When to Use This
- Designing new courses or updating existing ones
- Creating unit plans and learning sequences
- Mapping curriculum to standards and objectives
- Developing program-level curriculum frameworks

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Define outcomes and standards** - Identify what students should know and do
2. **Sequence learning experiences** - Organize units, lessons, and assessments
3. **Map and align components** - Ensure coherence across objectives, activities, and assessments

**Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks for course outline, 4-8 weeks for comprehensive curriculum
