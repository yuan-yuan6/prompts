# Research Impact, Innovation & Improvement Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess readiness to deliver real-world impact from a research project across six dimensions: Stakeholder & Outcome Alignment, Dissemination Strategy Fit, Knowledge Translation & Implementation Pathways, Innovation & Method/Tech Fit, Impact Measurement & Evaluation, and Sustainability & Continuous Improvement. This framework helps you avoid “publish and pray” dissemination and build an executable impact plan.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **research impact readiness** for **{RESEARCH_CONTEXT}** targeting **{TARGET_AUDIENCES}** to achieve **{IMPACT_GOALS}**. Evaluate across: (1) **Stakeholder alignment**—are users, decision makers, and beneficiaries explicit, with outcomes they care about? (2) **Dissemination fit**—are channels and products matched to audiences (papers, briefs, workshops, tools)? (3) **Translation pathways**—is there a credible route from findings to practice/policy/product change? (4) **Innovation fit**—do proposed methods/technology improve outcomes without increasing risk or complexity beyond capacity? (5) **Impact measurement**—are metrics, baselines, and attribution expectations defined? (6) **Sustainability & improvement**—is there a plan for maintenance, updates, partnerships, and learning loops? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top risks, and a 90-day impact plan.

**Usage:** Replace the curly-brace placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid impact readiness evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive research impact, innovation, and improvement readiness assessment for {RESEARCH_CONTEXT} targeting {TARGET_AUDIENCES} to achieve {IMPACT_GOALS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. STAKEHOLDER & OUTCOME ALIGNMENT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the impact intent is grounded by assessing whether primary stakeholders are identified with specific decisions they control, whether beneficiaries and equity considerations are explicit, and whether desired outcomes are defined in measurable or observable terms. Examine whether the research outputs are likely to be legible and usable to the target audiences, whether incentives and constraints in the adoption environment are understood, and whether you have validated needs through stakeholder input rather than assumptions.

**2. DISSEMINATION STRATEGY FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether dissemination is targeted rather than generic by assessing whether you have a channel strategy matched to each audience, with clear products (journal article, conference paper, policy brief, toolkit, training) and a timeline that aligns with decision cycles. Examine whether messaging is disciplined, whether you have a plan for plain-language interpretation, and whether your dissemination approach is resourced enough to execute beyond academic publication.

**3. KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION & IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS READINESS**
Evaluate whether there is a plausible “last mile” by assessing whether you have identified implementation partners, workflows, or policy levers that can convert findings into action. Examine whether barriers and facilitators are anticipated, whether adaptation to local context is planned, and whether you have a minimum viable translation product (e.g., checklist, protocol, decision aid, training module) that can be piloted and improved.

**4. INNOVATION & METHOD/TECH FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether innovation is purposeful by assessing whether any new methods, tools, or technologies are selected because they improve validity, efficiency, accessibility, or adoption rather than because they are fashionable. Examine whether the team can operate and maintain the innovation, whether ethical/privacy implications are addressed, and whether the added complexity is justified by expected impact. If AI or automation is included, assess guardrails, human oversight, and failure-mode handling.

**5. IMPACT MEASUREMENT & EVALUATION READINESS**
Evaluate whether impact claims can be evidenced by assessing whether metrics are defined across outputs, outcomes, and longer-term impact, whether baselines and targets exist, and whether measurement burden is feasible. Examine whether attribution expectations are realistic given the context, whether you have a plan for qualitative feedback and unintended consequences, and whether you can track uptake and reach across different channels.

**6. SUSTAINABILITY & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
Evaluate whether impact can persist by assessing whether ownership and governance are defined, whether resources exist for maintenance (updates, training refresh, tool support), and whether partnership strategy supports continued dissemination and implementation. Examine whether learning loops exist (regular reviews, stakeholder feedback, revisions), whether there is a plan for scaling, and whether success criteria include durability rather than one-time visibility.

## Required Output Format

Structure your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, top 3 impact risks, recommended focus for next 90 days

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with each dimension, score (X.X/5), biggest gap, and highest-leverage fix

3. **IMPACT THEORY (SHORT)** - A simple pathway: outputs → adoption → outcomes → impact, including key assumptions

4. **DELIVERABLES BY AUDIENCE** - What you will ship for each audience (paper, brief, toolkit, training, talk) and why

5. **MEASUREMENT PLAN** - Metrics, baselines, data sources, cadence, and how you will interpret mixed signals

6. **90-DAY PLAN** - Sequenced actions, owners, milestones, and a pilot/feedback loop

Use this maturity scale:
- **1.0–1.9: Unfocused** (unclear audiences/outcomes; dissemination is generic; impact unlikely)
- **2.0–2.9: Developing** (some plan exists; major gaps in translation, resourcing, or measurement)
- **3.0–3.9: Viable** (credible plan; needs targeted strengthening and piloting)
- **4.0–4.9: Strong** (well-aligned, measurable, resourced; likely to produce uptake)
- **5.0: Exemplary** (repeatable impact system; durable adoption and learning loops)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{RESEARCH_CONTEXT}` | What the project is and what it produced/will produce | "Pragmatic trial of a new discharge checklist in two hospital systems" |
| `{TARGET_AUDIENCES}` | Who must understand and act on the findings | "Unit managers, clinical educators, patient safety leaders, policymakers" |
| `{IMPACT_GOALS}` | What outcomes you want to change and how you’ll know | "Reduce 30-day readmissions by 10% and improve discharge comprehension" |

## Usage Example

**Input:**
"{RESEARCH_CONTEXT}: Evaluation of a district-wide tutoring program using administrative data and teacher interviews"
"{TARGET_AUDIENCES}: District leadership, principals, math department heads, state education office"
"{IMPACT_GOALS}: Improve pass rates in Algebra I and reduce equity gaps"

**Output (abridged):**
- Overall Readiness: **2.8/5.0 (Developing)**
- Top Risks: stakeholders not aligned on success metrics, translation product not defined (only “publish”), measurement plan lacks baseline and cadence

Dimension Scorecard:
- Stakeholder & Outcomes: 2.6/5 (agree on primary metric + equity stratification)
- Dissemination Fit: 2.9/5 (add district-facing brief + principal playbook)
- Translation Pathways: 2.4/5 (pilot implementation toolkit with 2 schools)
- Innovation Fit: 3.2/5 (keep methods simple; avoid tooling that adds burden)
- Measurement: 2.5/5 (define baseline year; quarterly reporting cadence)
- Sustainability: 3.0/5 (identify owner in district; plan annual refresh)

90-day plan:
- Weeks 1–2: Stakeholder workshop to align metrics and decision points; draft impact theory.
- Weeks 3–6: Produce two deliverables (policy brief + principal playbook) and run a pilot in 2 schools.
- Weeks 7–10: Collect feedback, refine toolkit, define reporting dashboard metrics.
- Weeks 11–13: Scale to 6 schools; publish a technical appendix for transparency.
