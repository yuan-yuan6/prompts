# Feature Prioritization Framework Template

## Purpose
Systematically evaluate and prioritize product features using proven frameworks (RICE, Value vs Effort, Kano) to maximize impact, align with strategy, and make defensible prioritization decisions.

## Quick Start

**Need to prioritize features quickly?** Use the RICE framework:

### Minimal Example
```
Feature: AI-powered search
- Reach: 10,000 users/quarter (all active users)
- Impact: 3 (Massive - core pain point)
- Confidence: 80% (customer interviews + prototype)
- Effort: 4 person-months
- RICE Score: (10,000 × 3 × 0.8) / 4 = 6,000

Feature: Dark mode
- Reach: 3,000 users/quarter (30% who requested)
- Impact: 1 (Medium - nice to have)
- Confidence: 100% (clear requirement)
- Effort: 2 person-months
- RICE Score: (3,000 × 1 × 1.0) / 2 = 1,500

Priority: AI search (6,000) >> Dark mode (1,500)
```

### When to Use This
- Roadmap planning cycles
- Responding to feature requests
- Resolving stakeholder disagreements
- Resource allocation decisions
- Communicating tradeoffs

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **List & categorize** - Gather all potential features, group by type
2. **Score systematically** - Apply framework (RICE/Value-Effort) to each
3. **Prioritize & communicate** - Rank, explain decisions, share rationale

## Best Practices

**Framework Selection:**
1. **RICE for most features** - Quantitative, defensible, comparable
2. **Value/Effort for quick decisions** - Simple, visual, fast
3. **Kano for understanding customer psychology** - Reveals must-haves vs delighters
4. **Weighted scoring for strategic features** - Multi-criteria, nuanced

**Scoring Tips:**
1. **Be consistent** - Use same definitions across all features
2. **Use data** - Base scores on evidence, not opinions
3. **Document assumptions** - Note how you calculated estimates
4. **Revisit scores** - Update as you learn more
5. **Compare relatively** - Scores matter relative to each other

**Common Pitfalls:**
❌ **HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)** - Exec request = auto-prioritize
✅ Instead: Run exec requests through same framework

❌ **Squeaky wheel gets grease** - Loudest customer wins
✅ Instead: Weight by revenue/segment importance

❌ **Recency bias** - Latest request feels most urgent
✅ Instead: Regular review of entire backlog

❌ **Sunk cost fallacy** - "We already started so must finish"
✅ Instead: Willing to kill features that no longer make sense
