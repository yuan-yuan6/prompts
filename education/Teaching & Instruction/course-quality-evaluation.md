- Look for patterns across items (e.g., multiple tech complaints)
- Disaggregate by student subgroups if appropriate (with caution about small numbers)

**Qualitative Analysis**:
- Read all open-ended responses
- Identify common themes and patterns
- Note outlier comments (very positive or negative)
- Look for specific, actionable suggestions
- Distinguish between personal preferences and systemic issues
- Consider context (e.g., challenging content may get negative feedback but be necessary)

**Triangulation**:
- Compare multiple data sources (survey + analytics + student work)
- Do perceptions align with actual performance?
- Are there contradictions to explore?
- What do multiple sources reveal about effectiveness?

### Interpreting Learning Outcomes

**Success Criteria**:
- What percentage of students achieved each learning objective?
- Are there objectives consistently not met?
- Which assessments show strongest/weakest performance?
- Are there equity gaps in achievement?

**Root Cause Analysis**:
If students aren't achieving objectives, why?
- Insufficient instruction or practice?
- Assessment doesn't match instruction?
- Objective unrealistic for course timeframe?
- Prerequisite knowledge gaps?
- Lack of student engagement or effort?
- External factors (pandemic, work obligations)?

## 4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS

### Systematic Review Cycle

**Annual Course Review**:
- Compile all feedback and data from semester/year
- Analyze against quality standards
- Identify 3-5 priority improvement areas
- Develop action plan with specific changes
- Document changes and rationale
- Implement revisions before next offering

**After Each Course Offering**:
- Quick review of evaluations and grade distribution
- Note immediate issues to address (broken links, unclear assignments)
- Small tweaks for next time
- Add to running list of larger changes for annual review

**Multi-Year Trends**:
- Track metrics over time (3-5 years)
- Are improvements working?
- Are new issues emerging?
- How has student population changed?
- What broader trends affect the course?

### Prioritizing Improvements

**Impact vs. Effort Matrix**:
| High Impact, Low Effort | High Impact, High Effort |
| Quick wins - do first! | Major projects - plan carefully |
| Low Impact, Low Effort | Low Impact, High Effort |
| Nice to have - if time | Avoid - not worth it |

**Prioritization Criteria**:
- Alignment with learning objectives (fixes that improve outcomes prioritized)
- Student feedback frequency (many students mention = priority)
- Feasibility (time, resources, expertise needed)
- Timing (can it be done before next offering?)
- Equity (does it help underserved students?)

### Implementing Changes

**Change Process**:
1. **Identify Issue**: What's the problem? (based on data)
2. **Root Cause**: Why is this happening?
3. **Solution**: What change will address the root cause?
4. **Plan**: How will change be implemented?
5. **Implement**: Make the change
6. **Communicate**: Tell students what changed and why
7. **Evaluate**: Did the change improve things?

**Document Changes**:
- Keep change log: what was changed, when, why
- Save previous versions of materials
- Track whether changes had desired effect
- Share improvements with colleagues
