# Wealth Management Readiness Assessment — Risk Management & Implementation

## Purpose
Assess how ready you are to protect wealth (insurance, liability, operational risks) and execute an implementation plan that is trackable, time-bound, and resilient to real-world change.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess risk and implementation readiness for [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]. Evaluate coverage adequacy (life/disability/health/property/liability), liability and asset protection, cyber/identity risks and controls, implementation plan quality (owners, dates, dependencies), monitoring and review cadence, and incident/claims readiness. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Coverage Inventory & Adequacy
- 1: Policies and limits are unknown; gaps are discovered after events.
- 3: Inventory exists; adequacy checks are periodic.
- 5: Inventory is current with documented adequacy logic and review cadence.

2) Life, Disability & Income Protection
- 1: Income protection is untested; dependents aren’t fully considered.
- 3: Core coverage exists; assumptions may be outdated.
- 5: Coverage is sized to goals, obligations, and contingencies with reviews.

3) Property, Liability & Asset Protection
- 1: Liability limits are minimal; umbrella coverage is inconsistent.
- 3: Umbrella exists; key exposures are partially addressed.
- 5: Coordinated liability posture with limits, exclusions, and legal structure reviewed.

4) Cyber, Fraud & Operational Controls
- 1: Identity/cyber risks are unmanaged; controls are informal.
- 3: Basic controls exist; incident steps are known but not tested.
- 5: Standard controls and a tested response plan for common incidents.

5) Implementation Plan & Execution Discipline
- 1: Recommendations aren’t sequenced; follow-through is inconsistent.
- 3: Plan exists; owners and dates are sometimes missing.
- 5: Sequenced plan with owners, dates, dependencies, and evidence of completion.

6) Monitoring, Claims/Incident Handling & Continuous Improvement
- 1: No review cycle; lessons aren’t captured.
- 3: Periodic reviews occur; changes are reactive.
- 5: Fixed cadence, claims/incident playbooks, and continuous improvement.

## Deliverables
- Insurance inventory and coverage adequacy summary (with assumptions)
- Liability and asset protection checklist (umbrella, titling, legal structure)
- Cyber/identity protection checklist and incident steps
- Implementation tracker (actions, owners, dates, dependencies, evidence)
- Review cadence and triggers (when to revisit coverage and limits)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — coverage gaps and missed follow-through.
- Level 2: Documented — inventory exists; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard reviews and implementation tracking.
- Level 4: Managed — clear triggers, evidence, and disciplined updates.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous refinement based on outcomes and incidents.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]
- [DEPENDENTS]
- [INCOME_LEVEL]
- [ASSET_BASE]
- [CURRENT_COVERAGE]
- [LIABILITY_EXPOSURES]
- [CYBER_RISK_PROFILE]
- [IMPLEMENTATION_TIMELINE]

## Example (Condensed)
High-income household with growing net worth.
- Coverage: term life sized to income replacement and education funding.
- Liability: umbrella limit aligned to asset base; exclusions reviewed.
- Execution: implementation tracker with owners and quarterly reviews.
