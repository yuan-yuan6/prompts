# Quality Assurance Framework Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive quality assurance programs covering quality standards, testing protocols, and continuous improvement processes to ensure consistent product and service excellence.

## Quick Start

To establish effective quality assurance quickly:

1. **Document Current Quality Issues**: List the top 5 defects, customer complaints, or quality failures occurring in the last 90 days with their frequency and impact

2. **Define Critical Standards**: Identify the 3-5 most important quality criteria for your product/service and set clear, measurable acceptance criteria

3. **Implement Basic Testing**: Create simple checklists for inspection at critical control points - incoming materials, in-process checks, and final inspection

4. **Track and Measure**: Set up a basic defect tracking system to record issues, root causes, and corrective actions taken

5. **Start Root Cause Analysis**: For your top quality issue, conduct a simple "5 Whys" analysis to identify the underlying cause and implement a fix

**Pro Tip**: Focus first on customer-facing defects that impact satisfaction or safety. Addressing these builds immediate credibility for your QA program.
