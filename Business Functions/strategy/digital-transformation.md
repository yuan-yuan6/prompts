# Digital Transformation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to deliver a digital transformation that improves customer outcomes, modernizes technology, digitizes processes, and builds durable capabilities for continuous improvement.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess digital transformation readiness for [ORGANIZATION] in [INDUSTRY] with an investment of [BUDGET] over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Vision & value case, (2) Customer and process redesign, (3) Technology architecture & delivery, (4) Data & analytics foundations, (5) Change management & culture, (6) Governance, risk & security. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Vision & Value Case
- 1 — Initial: Transformation goals are broad; benefits are not quantified; initiative list is a grab bag.
- 3 — Defined: Clear outcomes and measurable benefits; priorities aligned to strategy; scope is explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Benefits tracked to realization; value case guides sequencing and tradeoffs; portfolio is continuously refined.

### 2) Customer and Process Redesign
- 1 — Initial: Digitization is tool-first; process pain points are not mapped; limited customer journey insight.
- 3 — Defined: Key journeys/processes are mapped; redesign precedes automation; ownership is clear.
- 5 — Optimized: Human-in-the-loop workflows are designed; continuous improvement loops exist; adoption is measured and improved.

### 3) Technology Architecture & Delivery
- 1 — Initial: Legacy constraints dominate; delivery is slow; integration is fragile; technical debt accumulates.
- 3 — Defined: Target architecture exists; delivery practices are standardized; integration patterns are established.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular architecture; reliable delivery pipelines; measurable platform health; rapid iteration without instability.

### 4) Data & Analytics Foundations
- 1 — Initial: Data is siloed; inconsistent definitions; analytics are manual; data governance is minimal.
- 3 — Defined: Core data domains are integrated; definitions are standardized; governance and access are managed.
- 5 — Optimized: Trusted data products; real-time/near-real-time where needed; strong governance enabling self-service and reuse.

### 5) Change Management & Culture
- 1 — Initial: Change is underfunded; training and comms are inconsistent; resistance is handled reactively.
- 3 — Defined: Change plan exists; champions and training are organized; adoption metrics are tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Culture supports learning and experimentation; incentives reinforce new ways of working; change capability is institutionalized.

### 6) Governance, Risk & Security
- 1 — Initial: Decision rights are unclear; security and controls are bolted on late; risk ownership is diffuse.
- 3 — Defined: Governance model and escalation paths; security-by-design practices; risk register maintained.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance accelerates delivery; standardized controls; clear accountability and continuous risk monitoring.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Prioritized initiative list with sequencing logic (dependencies, value, risk)
- Capability gaps and remediation actions
- 90-day plan (people, process, data, technology, change)
- Success metrics (adoption, cycle time, reliability, value realization)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [BUDGET]: Transformation budget
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 12–24 months)
- [TOP_INITIATIVES]: Candidate initiatives (cloud migration, automation, digital products)
- [CUSTOMER_JOURNEYS]: Priority journeys/processes

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Healthcare provider modernizing patient access and back office
- Scores (1–5): Vision 3; Process Redesign 2; Technology 2; Data 2; Change 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Process redesign capacity, integration architecture, data definitions, adoption measurement
- 90-day priorities: Establish target architecture + integration patterns; map top journeys; define data glossary; launch change champions + training
