## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start Specific
Be as specific as possible when filling in variables. Generic inputs produce generic outputs.

**❌ Generic:**
```
[TARGET_AUDIENCE]: "customers"
[OBJECTIVE]: "improve sales"
```

**✅ Specific:**
```
[TARGET_AUDIENCE]: "Enterprise SaaS buyers, IT directors at 500+ employee companies"
[OBJECTIVE]: "increase demo-to-paid conversion by 25% in Q2"
```

### 2. Provide Context
Many templates have optional context fields - use them! More context leads to better results.

### 3. Iterate and Refine
Start with a template, get initial results, then refine variables based on output quality.

### 4. Combine Templates
Many templates work well together. For example:
- Use **Strategic Planning** → then **OKR Implementation**
- Use **Market Analysis** → then **Marketing Campaign**
- Use **Exploratory Analysis** → then **Predictive Modeling**

### 5. Customize for Your Domain
Most templates include customization sections. Adapt them to your specific industry or use case.
