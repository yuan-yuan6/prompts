# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to draft and negotiate enforceable contracts efficiently across six dimensions: Intake & Deal Context, Drafting Standards & Structure, Risk Allocation, Compliance & Data Protection, Negotiation & Approvals, and Execution & Lifecycle Management. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce a roadmap tied to measurable cycle time and risk outcomes.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **contract drafting readiness** for **[ORGANIZATION]** handling **[CONTRACT_PORTFOLIO]** under **[JURISDICTION_AND_REGULATORY_CONTEXT]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Intake & deal context**—are objectives, scope, parties, and inputs captured reliably before drafting? (2) **Drafting standards**—do we have clear templates, definitions, and document architecture that prevent ambiguity? (3) **Risk allocation**—are clause positions, fallback options, and approval thresholds aligned to risk appetite? (4) **Compliance & data**—are privacy/security/regulatory requirements captured and flowed into contracts consistently? (5) **Negotiation & approvals**—is negotiation disciplined, with clear escalation and fast approvals? (6) **Execution & lifecycle**—are signatures, storage, obligation tracking, and renewals managed with owners and evidence? Provide a maturity scorecard (1–5), top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 12-month capability plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid contract drafting capability evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive contract drafting readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} handling {CONTRACT_PORTFOLIO} under {JURISDICTION_AND_REGULATORY_CONTEXT}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. INTAKE & DEAL CONTEXT READINESS**
- Intake questionnaire covers required inputs (scope, pricing, term, parties, risks)
- Counterparty due diligence inputs available (KYC/sanctions, credit, vendor risk)
- Stakeholder alignment captured (business owner, finance, security, privacy)
- Dependency capture (customer responsibilities, access, data, SMEs, timelines)
- Non-standard asks identified early (audit rights, unusual warranties, special terms)
- Deal approval path defined before negotiation begins

**2. DRAFTING STANDARDS & STRUCTURE READINESS**
- Templates are current and modular (MSA + SOW/Order forms; exhibits)
- Definitions are consistent and reduce ambiguity
- Order of precedence is standard and consistently applied
- Clause library exists with rationale and usage guidance
- Cross-document consistency checks exist (references, numbering, conflicts)
- Quality checklist exists (entities, dates, exhibits, survival, notices)

**3. RISK ALLOCATION READINESS**
- Risk appetite is defined and translated into clause positions
- Positions matrix exists (preferred/fallback/walk-away) for key clauses
- Liability caps/exclusions/carve-outs are coherent and justified
- Indemnity posture is defined (IP, privacy/security, third-party claims)
- Warranties/remedies/termination rights align to the operating reality
- Insurance and compliance requirements are realistic and enforceable

**4. COMPLIANCE, PRIVACY & DATA READINESS**
- Regulatory requirements mapped to contract clauses (sector, geography)
- Data protection approach standardized (DPA terms; subprocessor controls)
- Security obligations are measurable (standards, audit evidence, incident notice)
- Export controls/sanctions/AML (as relevant) handled consistently
- Recordkeeping, auditability, and retention obligations are defined
- Flow-down requirements to subcontractors are explicit and monitored

**5. NEGOTIATION & APPROVALS READINESS**
- Negotiation workflow is defined (who redlines, who approves, SLAs)
- Escalation thresholds are clear (risk, spend, policy exceptions)
- Business/legal alignment maintained (no “silent” concessions)
- Redline rationale and fallback language provided to negotiators
- Version control and comment hygiene reduce churn
- Metrics tracked (cycle time, escalations, exception rate)

**6. EXECUTION & LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Execution mechanics are repeatable (authority, signature process, completeness)
- Final packages stored with searchable metadata and access controls
- Obligations extracted and assigned (SLAs, reporting, renewals, notices)
- Change control is enforced (amendments, SOW changes, side letters)
- Renewal/exit processes exist (dates tracked, transition plans defined)
- Continuous improvement loop updates templates based on disputes/incidents

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities, top risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **CONTRACTING OPERATING MODEL CHECKLIST** - Intake → draft → negotiate → execute → manage

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions

5. **12-MONTH ROADMAP** - Quarterly actions across templates, playbooks, approvals, and ops

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Cycle time, exception rate, disputes, missed obligations, audit findings

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc drafting, inconsistent risk positions)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic templates, frequent escalations and rework)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable drafting and negotiation, clear roles)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (risk-aligned playbooks, measured process, disciplined ops)
- 5.0: Optimized (fast, consistent contracting with strong risk outcomes)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Contracting organization | "MetroCare Health" |
| `[CONTRACT_PORTFOLIO]` | Contract types/volume in scope | "Vendor SaaS + professional services agreements" |
| `[JURISDICTION_AND_REGULATORY_CONTEXT]` | Applicable law/regulatory constraints | "US (HIPAA), multi-state privacy" |

## Example

**Healthcare - Vendor Contracts**

> Assess contract drafting readiness for **MetroCare Health** handling **vendor SaaS + professional services agreements** under **US (HIPAA), multi-state privacy**. (1) Intake—security/privacy inputs arrive late, driving rework. (2) Standards—templates exist but definitions and order of precedence vary across departments. (3) Risk allocation—liability caps and indemnities are negotiated inconsistently; approval thresholds are unclear. (4) Compliance—HIPAA and breach notice clauses differ by contract; subcontractor flow-downs are inconsistent. (5) Negotiation—redlines are handled by email; version control issues create delays. (6) Lifecycle—renewal dates aren’t tracked centrally; SLAs lack owners. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a 12-month plan focusing on intake discipline, clause positions, and obligation tracking.
