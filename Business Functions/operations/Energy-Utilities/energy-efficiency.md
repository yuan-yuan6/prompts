# Energy Efficiency Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan and execute energy efficiency initiatives with reliable measurement, controls, and governance.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess energy efficiency readiness for portfolio [PORTFOLIO]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Baselines & metering, (2) Initiative pipeline, (3) Controls & operations, (4) Measurement & verification, (5) Stakeholder alignment, (6) Governance & scaling. Provide a scorecard and 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Baselines & Metering
- 1 — Initial: Baselines unclear; metering insufficient.
- 3 — Defined: Metering plan and baselines defined; data QA exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Metering is robust; baselines are trusted and auditable.

### 2) Initiative Pipeline
- 1 — Initial: Initiatives ad-hoc; prioritization unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Pipeline and prioritization criteria defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Pipeline is optimized; initiatives selected by ROI and feasibility.

### 3) Controls & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Operational controls limited; inconsistent practices.
- 3 — Defined: Controls and SOPs defined; training exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Controls are mature; optimization is continuous and reliable.

### 4) Measurement & Verification
- 1 — Initial: Savings claims unverified.
- 3 — Defined: M&V plan exists; methods documented.
- 5 — Optimized: M&V is automated and trusted; results drive decisions.

### 5) Stakeholder Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; incentives misaligned.
- 3 — Defined: Stakeholders aligned on goals; roles defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Alignment is strong; incentives support sustained savings.

### 6) Governance & Scaling
- 1 — Initial: No governance; improvements don’t persist.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence and reporting; scaling plan.
- 5 — Optimized: Scaling is systematic across sites with standard practices.

## Deliverables
- Efficiency readiness scorecard and gap list
- Metering/baseline plan
- Initiative pipeline and prioritization model
- M&V methodology and reporting pack
- Governance cadence and scaling roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PORTFOLIO]: Sites/assets
- [BASELINE]: Baseline consumption
- [INITIATIVES]: Initiatives
- [METERING]: Metering
- [M&V]: Measurement & verification
- [TARGETS]: Savings targets

## Example (Condensed)
- Portfolio: 50 commercial buildings
- Scores (1–5): Baselines 2; Pipeline 3; Controls 2; M&V 2; Alignment 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Improve metering; define M&V; operationalize controls; standardize reporting cadence
