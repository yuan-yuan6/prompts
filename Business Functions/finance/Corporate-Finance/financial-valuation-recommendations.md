# Financial Valuation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to produce valuation work that is transparent, defensible, and decision-grade (DCF, comps, transactions) and to translate it into clear recommendations.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess valuation readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] for [VALUATION_PURPOSE] as of [VALUATION_DATE]. Evaluate inputs and normalization, forecast and drivers, method selection discipline, cost of capital/capital structure rigor, scenario/sensitivity coverage, and governance/recommendation narrative. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Inputs, Data Quality & Normalization
- 1: Inputs are inconsistent; adjustments are unclear.
- 3: Core inputs exist; normalization is done for major cases.
- 5: Traceable sources and documented normalization are standard.

2) Forecast Quality & Driver Logic
- 1: Forecast is top-down and not explainable.
- 3: Key drivers are documented but not consistently audited.
- 5: Driver-based forecast with clear assumptions and sensitivity hooks.

3) Valuation Methods & Comparables Discipline
- 1: Method choice is arbitrary; comps are weak.
- 3: DCF + comps used for major decisions; peer set is periodic.
- 5: Method selection criteria and comparable screens are defined and repeatable.

4) Capital Structure, WACC & Discounting Rigor
- 1: WACC is copied; inputs are not sourced.
- 3: WACC inputs tracked; periodic refresh.
- 5: Sourced inputs (rates, ERP, beta), defensible adjustments, and review checks.

5) Scenarios, Sensitivities & Risk Framing
- 1: Single range without explanation.
- 3: Base/bull/bear and a few sensitivities.
- 5: Scenario logic, stress tests, and key risk signposts are standard.

6) Governance & Recommendation Narrative
- 1: No review gates; outputs vary by author.
- 3: Reviews happen for high-stakes work.
- 5: QA, sign-offs, and consistent investment thesis storytelling are standard.

## Deliverables
- Valuation brief (purpose, standard of value, horizon, methods)
- Input and normalization log (sources, adjustments, rationale)
- Valuation model(s) (DCF and/or comps) with clear inputs/outputs
- Sensitivity and scenario summary (key levers and ranges)
- Recommendation summary (range, catalysts, risks, decision implications)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — opaque models and inconsistent assumptions.
- Level 2: Documented — templates exist but method rigor varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard methods used for most decisions.
- Level 4: Managed — sensitivities, sourcing, and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — outcomes feedback improves assumptions and methods.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [VALUATION_PURPOSE] (M&A, investment, fairness)
- [VALUATION_DATE]
- [FORECAST_PERIOD]
- [PEER_SET]
- [WACC_ASSUMPTIONS]
- [SCENARIOS]

## Example (Condensed)
Acquisition valuation for a vertical SaaS company.
- Methods: DCF + trading comps + recent transactions.
- Drivers: ARR growth, churn, margin expansion, working capital.
- Sensitivities: WACC ±150 bps, terminal growth ±100 bps, churn +200 bps.
- Output: valuation range with rationale, risks, and decision implications.
