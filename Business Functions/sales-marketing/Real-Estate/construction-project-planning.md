# Construction Project Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan construction projects with clear scope, schedule, budget, procurement, risk controls, and governance for predictable delivery.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess construction planning readiness for [PROJECT] with budget [BUDGET] and timeline [TIMELINE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Scope & requirements, (2) Schedule & milestones, (3) Budget & cost controls, (4) Procurement & contractors, (5) Risk & safety management, (6) Governance & reporting. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a project planning plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Requirements
- 1 — Initial: Scope is unclear; change requests frequent.
- 3 — Defined: Requirements and acceptance criteria documented; change control defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scope is stable; changes are managed with clear tradeoffs and approvals.

### 2) Schedule & Milestones
- 1 — Initial: Schedule is high-level; dependencies unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Detailed schedule with milestones; critical path identified; cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Schedule risk is managed proactively; forecasting is accurate and updated.

### 3) Budget & Cost Controls
- 1 — Initial: Budget tracking is manual; overruns discovered late.
- 3 — Defined: Cost breakdown structure; controls; reporting cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Costs are controlled; variances trigger actions early; forecasts are reliable.

### 4) Procurement & Contractors
- 1 — Initial: Vendor selection ad-hoc; contracts inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Procurement plan; contractor criteria; contract standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Supplier performance is managed; procurement reduces delays and rework.

### 5) Risk & Safety Management
- 1 — Initial: Risks and safety plans not formalized.
- 3 — Defined: Risk register and safety plan; inspections and incident process.
- 5 — Optimized: Risk/safety controls are embedded; incidents decline; issues resolved quickly.

### 6) Governance & Reporting
- 1 — Initial: Governance unclear; stakeholders surprised by issues.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights, reporting cadence, and escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables fast decisions; reporting is decision-grade and trusted.

## Deliverables
- Construction planning readiness scorecard and gap list
- Project scope and change control plan
- Schedule and milestone plan (critical path)
- Budget and cost control framework
- Risk register, safety plan, and governance cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROJECT]: Project name
- [BUDGET]: Budget
- [TIMELINE]: Timeline
- [MILESTONES]: Key milestones
- [CONTRACTOR_SET]: Contractors and vendors
- [RISK_REGISTER]: Key risks

## Example (Condensed)
- Project: Multi-unit renovation with tight timeline
- Scores (1–5): Scope 3; Schedule 2; Budget 2; Procurement 2; Risk/Safety 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Build detailed schedule; implement cost controls; formalize procurement and reporting cadence
