# Regulatory Compliance Readiness Assessment (Program-Level)

## Purpose
Assess readiness of an end-to-end regulatory compliance program across six dimensions: Regulatory Scope & Obligations, Governance & Policy Control, Risk Assessment & Control Mapping, Monitoring & Regulatory Change, Assurance & Issue Management, and Reporting & Evidence. Use the results to prioritize investments and produce a time-bound roadmap.

## Template

Conduct a program-level regulatory compliance readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating across {JURISDICTIONS} under {CORE_REGULATIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. REGULATORY SCOPE & OBLIGATIONS READINESS**
- Regulatory inventory exists and is current (laws, regs, guidance)
- Obligations are mapped to processes/products and jurisdictions
- Ownership exists for key obligations (business + compliance + legal)
- Third-party obligations are included (vendors/partners)
- Regulatory change sources and triage criteria exist

**2. GOVERNANCE & POLICY CONTROL READINESS**
- Three lines of defense is defined with clear boundaries
- Decision rights exist for approvals, exceptions, and risk acceptance
- Policy lifecycle is controlled (review cadence, versioning, attestation)
- Roles/resourcing cover key risk areas and jurisdictions
- Culture/training expectations are clear and reinforced

**3. RISK ASSESSMENT & CONTROL MAPPING READINESS**
- Risk taxonomy is usable and adopted
- Risk scoring exists (impact, likelihood, detectability/velocity)
- Risks are mapped to controls, owners, and evidence requirements
- Control testing approach exists (what “effective” means)
- Gaps are tracked with prioritized remediation

**4. MONITORING & REGULATORY CHANGE READINESS**
- Monitoring coverage map exists (what/why/how often)
- Investigation workflow has owners, SLAs, and audit trail
- KRIs/thresholds are tuned and tied to playbooks
- Regulatory change is handled end-to-end (detect → assess → implement → evidence)
- Training updates are triggered by relevant changes

**5. ASSURANCE & ISSUE MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Audit/testing is repeatable with evidence standards
- Findings and issues are triaged with consistent severity model
- CAPA is governed (owners, dates, validation, escalation)
- Root cause analysis drives systemic fixes
- Recurrence is measured and addressed

**6. REPORTING & EVIDENCE READINESS**
- KPIs/KRIs are defined with controlled calculations and sources
- Board/executive reporting cadence exists and drives decisions
- Evidence is retrievable (policies, training, controls, monitoring, issues)
- Exam response playbook exists and is practiced
- Documentation retention and access controls are defined

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **TOP GAPS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency
4. **90-DAY PLAN** - Sequenced uplift actions with owners and success metrics
5. **METRICS PACK** - KPIs/KRIs definitions and reporting cadence
6. **EVIDENCE PACK** - Minimum evidence inventory for exam readiness

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (reactive, unclear ownership, weak evidence)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic components exist, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable governance/monitoring/audit practices)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured effectiveness, strong evidence discipline)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive prevention, continuous improvement, low recurrence)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "Consumer Lender" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "Financial Services" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US (multi-state)" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "UDAAP, privacy, AML" |

## Example

**Program-Level Readiness**

> Assess regulatory compliance program readiness for **Consumer Lender** in **financial services** across **US (multi-state)** under **UDAAP, privacy, AML**. Governance exists but exceptions and policy lifecycle controls are weak; monitoring is noisy and investigations are inconsistently documented; CAPA closure lacks validation and recurrence tracking; board reporting exists but KPI definitions are not controlled. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day plan focused on evidence standards, tuned KRIs/playbooks, and CAPA validation.
