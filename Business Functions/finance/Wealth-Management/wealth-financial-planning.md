# Financial Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to create an actionable financial plan across six dimensions: Goals & Priorities, Data & Baseline, Cash Flow & Savings Capacity, Investment Strategy, Tax/Insurance/Estate, and Implementation & Monitoring. Identify gaps and produce a “ready-to-plan” package.

## Template

Conduct a financial planning readiness assessment for {CLIENT_PROFILE} over {TIME_HORIZON}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. GOALS & PRIORITIES READINESS**
- Goals are explicit and ranked (retirement, home, education, philanthropy)
- Timelines and required amounts are estimated (ranges are acceptable)
- Trade-offs are acknowledged (spend vs save; risk vs certainty)
- Success definition is clear (income replacement, net worth, funded ratio)
- Constraints are explicit (liquidity, employment volatility, caregiving)

**2. DATA & BASELINE READINESS**
- Balance sheet is complete (assets, liabilities, account types)
- Income sources and variability are understood
- Benefits captured (401(k) match, pension, Social Security estimates)
- Tax filing status and prior-year returns are available (or approximated)
- Assumptions are documented (inflation, returns, savings growth)

**3. CASH FLOW & SAVINGS CAPACITY READINESS**
- Spending baseline is realistic (fixed vs variable)
- Emergency fund target is defined (months of expenses)
- Debt strategy is defined (paydown vs refinance vs maintain)
- Savings rate is feasible and automated where possible
- Large near-term cash needs are planned (home down payment, tuition)

**4. INVESTMENT STRATEGY READINESS**
- Risk tolerance and risk capacity are assessed (not just preference)
- Target allocation approach is defined (core/satellite; passive/active)
- Asset location considerations are understood (taxable vs tax-advantaged)
- Rebalancing rules are defined (calendar/threshold)
- Portfolio constraints exist (concentration, liquidity, prohibited assets)

**5. TAX, INSURANCE & ESTATE READINESS**
- Tax posture is understood (brackets, capital gains, deductions)
- Retirement account strategy is defined (traditional vs Roth; HSA use)
- Insurance coverage is reviewed (life, disability, liability, property)
- Estate basics are checked (beneficiaries, will/trust, POA/healthcare)
- Known compliance/administrative requirements are captured (beneficiary updates)

**6. IMPLEMENTATION & MONITORING READINESS**
- Action plan exists with owners and deadlines
- Review cadence is set (quarterly check-ins; annual plan refresh)
- Tracking metrics exist (savings rate, funded ratio, debt reduction)
- Documentation is centralized (accounts, policies, key documents)
- Decision rules exist for changes (job loss, market drawdown, new dependents)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 blockers
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **ASSUMPTIONS SHEET** - Key assumptions used for projections and decisions
4. **DATA GAPS LIST** - Missing items required to finalize the plan
5. **90-DAY ACTION PLAN** - Sequenced actions with owners and dependencies
6. **MONITORING CADENCE** - What to review monthly/quarterly/annually

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (goals unclear; missing baseline data)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic plan; weak assumptions and follow-through)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (solid baseline; actionable plan with manageable gaps)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (repeatable process; good documentation and monitoring)
- 5.0: Optimized (disciplined execution; plan adapts to life changes)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[CLIENT_PROFILE]` | Client profile summary | "Age 35, dual-income, 2 kids" |
| `[INCOME]` | Annual income | "$150K" |
| `[NET_WORTH]` | Net worth | "$250K" |
| `[GOALS]` | Primary goals | "Retire at 60; buy home in 3 years" |
| `[TIME_HORIZON]` | Planning horizon | "25 years" |

## Example

**Family Financial Plan - Readiness**

> Assess financial planning readiness for **age 35 couple** with **$150K** income and **$250K** net worth targeting **retire at 60 with $2M and buy a home in 3 years**. Goals are clear but trade-offs between down payment and retirement contributions need agreement; baseline data is mostly available but benefits and full account list require confirmation; cash flow needs a realistic spending baseline and emergency fund target; investment strategy needs defined allocation and rebalancing rules; tax/insurance/estate needs a coverage review and beneficiary audit; execution needs a 90-day action plan with owners. Provide a scorecard and ready-to-plan checklist.
