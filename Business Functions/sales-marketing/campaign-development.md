# Campaign Development Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan and execute marketing campaigns with clear objectives, audience insight, strong creative, disciplined channel execution, and measurable performance improvement.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess campaign development readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] running [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE] to reach [AUDIENCE_DESCRIPTION] with budget [BUDGET] over [TIMELINE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Objective & strategy fit, (2) Audience insight & targeting, (3) Creative & message system, (4) Channel plan & budget, (5) Execution & operations, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objective & Strategy Fit
- 1 — Initial: Objectives are vague; campaign doesn’t map to business outcomes.
- 3 — Defined: Clear objective, offer, audience, and KPI targets; constraints documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy aligns creative, channels, and budget; tradeoffs explicit; decisions are fast.

### 2) Audience Insight & Targeting
- 1 — Initial: Targeting is broad; limited insight; segments unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and segments documented; targeting rules by channel.
- 5 — Optimized: Insights refreshed continuously; segmentation is operationalized and measurable.

### 3) Creative & Message System
- 1 — Initial: Ad-hoc creative; inconsistent messaging; weak proof.
- 3 — Defined: Message pillars, proof points, and CTAs; creative brief standard.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular creative system; consistent message architecture across funnel and channels.

### 4) Channel Plan & Budget
- 1 — Initial: Channel selection is opportunistic; budgeting is arbitrary.
- 3 — Defined: Channel mix mapped to audience behavior; budget and cadence planned.
- 5 — Optimized: Spend shifts based on evidence; channel playbooks and sequencing improve efficiency.

### 5) Execution & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Roles unclear; approvals slow; QA inconsistent; rework high.
- 3 — Defined: Owners, timeline, and approvals; asset specs; QA checklist.
- 5 — Optimized: Predictable throughput; cross-functional coordination; minimal rework due to strong briefs and feedback.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Tracking gaps; reporting inconsistent; optimization is reactive.
- 3 — Defined: KPI definitions; dashboards; test cadence; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program; creative analytics; optimization ties to pipeline/revenue outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Campaign readiness scorecard and prioritized gap list
- Campaign brief (objective, audience, offer, message pillars, proof, CTA)
- Channel plan and budget allocation
- Execution plan (timeline, owners, approvals, QA)
- Measurement and testing plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]: Organization launching the campaign
- [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVE]: Awareness, acquisition, lead gen, product launch
- [AUDIENCE_DESCRIPTION]: Target segment description
- [BUDGET]: Budget
- [TIMELINE]: Timeline
- [CHANNEL_MIX]: Planned channel mix

## Example (Condensed)
- Campaign: B2B SaaS feature launch, 3 months
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Audience 2; Creative 3; Channel 3; Execution 2; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Weak approvals/QA; inconsistent tracking; limited experimentation
- 90-day priorities: Standardize briefs + QA; verify tracking; set weekly optimization cadence and learnings capture
