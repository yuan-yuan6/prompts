# AI Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess an organization's readiness to adopt and scale AI across six dimensions: Data, Technology, Talent, Process, Culture, and Governance. This framework identifies gaps, prioritizes investments, and creates a capability development roadmap.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive AI readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization planning to implement {USE_CASES}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. DATA READINESS**
- Data availability and coverage for target use cases
- Data quality (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness)
- Data integration and accessibility (silos, APIs, catalogs)
- AI-specific readiness (labeled data, feature engineering, versioning)

**2. TECHNOLOGY READINESS**
- Infrastructure (cloud adoption, compute, GPU, storage)
- ML/AI platform (experiment tracking, model registry, feature store)
- MLOps maturity (CI/CD, monitoring, automated retraining, drift detection)
- Integration capabilities (APIs, event streaming, ETL pipelines)

**3. TALENT READINESS**
- Current team (data scientists, ML engineers, AI PMs, architects)
- Skill depth (classical ML, deep learning, NLP/LLM, computer vision, MLOps)
- Talent strategy (hiring ability, retention, upskilling, partnerships)
- Business AI literacy (executives, managers, front-line, IT)

**4. PROCESS READINESS**
- AI development methodology and lifecycle
- Business process integration and human-AI workflow design
- Operational excellence (monitoring, incident response, feedback loops)

**5. CULTURE READINESS**
- Leadership commitment and executive sponsorship
- Innovation appetite and experimentation tolerance
- Cross-functional collaboration and data sharing
- Trust, adoption willingness, and AI augmentation mindset

**6. GOVERNANCE READINESS**
- AI ethics framework and responsible AI principles
- Risk management and model governance
- Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, industry-specific, privacy)
- Governance structure and decision rights

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities, investment estimate

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **USE CASE READINESS** - For each target use case, show readiness per dimension (✓/△/✗) and overall feasibility

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions

5. **ROADMAP** - Quarterly actions across Data, Technology, Talent, Process/Governance

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Current scores vs 6-month and 12-month targets

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous innovation)
