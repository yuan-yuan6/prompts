# Market Research Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run market research that produces decision-grade insights—clear objectives, sound methods, reliable data, and actionable recommendations.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess market research readiness for [PRODUCT_SERVICE] targeting [TARGET_MARKET] with budget [RESEARCH_BUDGET] over [TIMELINE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Decision clarity & scope, (2) Methodology & sampling, (3) Data collection & quality, (4) Analysis & synthesis, (5) Stakeholder alignment & operations, (6) Actionability & measurement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a research execution plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Decision Clarity & Scope
- 1 — Initial: Objectives are vague; research questions aren’t tied to decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Decisions and hypotheses are clear; scope and success criteria documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Research is tightly linked to decisions; scope is prioritized; tradeoffs are explicit.

### 2) Methodology & Sampling
- 1 — Initial: Methods chosen by habit; sampling bias likely; no rigor plan.
- 3 — Defined: Methods match questions; sampling plan; instrument design standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Mixed-method approach as needed; bias mitigations; repeatable standards.

### 3) Data Collection & Quality
- 1 — Initial: Data quality inconsistent; collection is ad-hoc; documentation missing.
- 3 — Defined: Collection plan with QA; respondent criteria; data handling procedures.
- 5 — Optimized: Data quality monitored; tooling supports scale; audit trail is maintained.

### 4) Analysis & Synthesis
- 1 — Initial: Findings are descriptive; limited triangulation; insights are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Analysis approach documented; segmentation and competitor synthesis; clear insight statements.
- 5 — Optimized: Triangulation across sources; quantified confidence; insights translate into prioritized actions.

### 5) Stakeholder Alignment & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Stakeholders disagree on goals; timelines slip; handoffs are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Stakeholder map; cadence; deliverables; clear roles and review points.
- 5 — Optimized: Fast governance; decisions are made from evidence; operations are predictable.

### 6) Actionability & Measurement
- 1 — Initial: Research ends as a report; actions and owners not defined.
- 3 — Defined: Recommendations tied to decisions; owners assigned; success metrics defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Actions tracked; research outcomes are measured; insights become reusable assets.

## Deliverables
- Research readiness scorecard with top gaps
- Research brief (decisions, hypotheses, scope, success criteria)
- Methodology and sampling plan
- Analysis plan and reporting format
- Action plan (recommendations, owners, metrics)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PRODUCT_SERVICE]: Product/service
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Target market definition
- [RESEARCH_BUDGET]: Budget
- [TIMELINE]: Timeline
- [RESEARCH_METHODS]: Surveys, interviews, focus groups, secondary research
- [KEY_DECISIONS]: Decisions the research will inform

## Example (Condensed)
- Product: Meal kit delivery for busy professionals
- Scores (1–5): Scope 3; Method 2; Data 2; Analysis 2; Stakeholders 3; Actionability 2
- Top gaps: Weak sampling plan; unclear synthesis approach; recommendations not tied to owners
- 90-day priorities: Define decision questions; create sampling/instrument standards; deliver action plan with owners and metrics
