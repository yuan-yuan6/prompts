## Best Practices

1. **Use Evidence-Based Interventions**: Select strategies proven effective in similar populations
2. **Address Multiple Levels**: Combine individual, community, and policy interventions
3. **Focus on High-Risk Groups**: Prioritize those most likely to benefit
4. **Build on Existing Resources**: Leverage current programs and infrastructure
5. **Engage Stakeholders Early**: Include community members and partners in planning
6. **Start with Pilot Testing**: Test interventions before large-scale rollout
7. **Monitor and Adapt**: Use data to continuously improve programs
8. **Address Health Equity**: Explicitly target disparities in disease burden
9. **Ensure Sustainability**: Plan for long-term funding and capacity
10. **Communicate Effectively**: Tailor messages to different audiences

## Tips for Success

- **Conduct thorough needs assessment** before designing interventions
- **Use health behavior theory** to guide intervention design
- **Build strong partnerships** across sectors (health, education, business)
- **Train and support staff** adequately for their roles
- **Make programs accessible** by removing barriers to participation
- **Use data dashboards** for real-time monitoring
- **Celebrate milestones** to maintain momentum and engagement
- **Document lessons learned** for continuous quality improvement
- **Advocate for supportive policies** that enable prevention
- **Plan for scale and spread** from the beginning
