# Client Relations & Account Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build **lasting, value-driven client relationships** that maximize retention, expansion, and advocacy. Use this to diagnose gaps in account strategy, engagement, issue resolution, and growth execution.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **client relations readiness** for {CLIENT_CONTEXT}. The relationship objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a client relations & account management readiness assessment for {CLIENT_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (health scores, engagement patterns, retention data, expansion pipeline).

**1) ACCOUNT STRATEGY & SEGMENTATION**
- Clients are segmented by value, complexity, and strategic importance
- Account plans exist with goals, stakeholders, risks, and growth opportunities
- Success criteria and value metrics are co-defined with the client
- Resources (AMs, SEs, execs) are aligned to account tier and need

**2) RELATIONSHIP MAPPING & STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT**
- Key stakeholders (economic buyer, champion, influencers) are identified
- Engagement cadence matches client preference and relationship maturity
- Executive sponsors are active in strategic accounts
- Relationship depth extends beyond single point of contact

**3) ONBOARDING & VALUE REALIZATION**
- Onboarding plans set clear milestones, timelines, and success measures
- Time-to-value is tracked and optimized
- Early wins and adoption checkpoints build momentum
- Handoff from sales to account management is seamless

**4) PROACTIVE ENGAGEMENT & BUSINESS REVIEWS**
- Quarterly or bi-annual business reviews (QBRs/EBRs) are planned and executed
- Reviews demonstrate ROI, highlight usage trends, and identify opportunities
- Communication is proactive (not just reactive to issues)
- Account health is monitored via usage, satisfaction, and engagement signals

**5) ISSUE RESOLUTION & ESCALATION**
- Issues are triaged by severity and escalated with clear ownership
- Response SLAs exist and are met consistently
- Root cause analysis prevents repeat issues
- Client trust is maintained through transparency and follow-through

**6) RETENTION & EXPANSION EXECUTION**
- Renewal pipeline is tracked with risk/health scoring
- Churn signals (usage decline, satisfaction drop, disengagement) trigger intervention
- Expansion plays (upsell, cross-sell, new use cases) are identified and pursued
- Client feedback drives product and service improvements

---

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, retention risk exposure, and top improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **ACCOUNT HEALTH DASHBOARD**
- Segment clients by health (green/yellow/red) and tier (strategic/growth/standard)
- Highlight at-risk accounts, renewal dates, and expansion pipeline

4) **STAKEHOLDER MAP**
- For top 5 accounts: key contacts, roles, engagement frequency, relationship strength

5) **ISSUE & ESCALATION LOG**
- Open issues by account, severity, owner, and status
- SLA compliance and recurring issue themes

6) **30/60/90-DAY RETENTION & GROWTH PLAN**
- Actions to stabilize at-risk accounts, improve engagement, and accelerate expansion
- Metrics (NRR, GRR, CSAT, QBR completion, expansion pipeline)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, inconsistent, high churn risk, limited visibility)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic processes exist, engagement gaps, retention challenges)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, stable retention, scaling friction)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (proactive, high retention, measured expansion, strong satisfaction)
- 5.0: Optimized (strategic partnership, predictable growth, client advocacy)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {CLIENT_CONTEXT}: Client portfolio, segments, ARR/count, relationship stages, tooling
- {OBJECTIVES}: Retention rate, NRR, CSAT, expansion goals, churn reduction
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Team size, systems, data availability, budget, geographic spread

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {CLIENT_CONTEXT}: B2B SaaS company with 80 enterprise clients ($25M ARR). Segments: 10 strategic ($15M), 30 growth ($8M), 40 standard ($2M). Average tenure: 2.5 years. Tools: Salesforce + Gainsight.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Achieve 95% GRR, 120% NRR, CSAT 8.5/10, expand 15 accounts in next 12 months.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 5 account managers (each managing 16 accounts); executive sponsor coverage limited to top 5 accounts; Gainsight data incomplete for 30% of accounts.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 3.1 (Defined)
- Retention risk: 8 accounts at-risk ($3.2M ARR); 12 renewals in next 90 days
- Top improvements: (1) formalize QBR cadence, (2) implement churn signal alerts, (3) expand stakeholder mapping

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Account Strategy & Segmentation: 3/5 — segmentation exists; account plans informal
- Relationship Mapping: 2/5 — single-threaded in 60% of accounts
- Onboarding & Value Realization: 3/5 — onboarding plan exists; time-to-value not tracked
- Proactive Engagement & Reviews: 3/5 — QBRs inconsistent (50% completion)
- Issue Resolution: 4/5 — SLA compliance 92%; escalation process strong
- Retention & Expansion: 3/5 — renewals tracked; expansion plays reactive

**3) ACCOUNT HEALTH DASHBOARD**
- Strategic (10 accounts, $15M): 7 green, 2 yellow, 1 red
- Growth (30 accounts, $8M): 18 green, 8 yellow, 4 red
- Standard (40 accounts, $2M): 25 green, 12 yellow, 3 red
- At-risk accounts (8 total, $3.2M ARR): declining usage (5), low CSAT (2), champion left (1)
- Renewal pipeline: 12 renewals in 90 days ($4.8M ARR); 3 high-risk
- Expansion pipeline: 6 opportunities qualified ($2.1M); 2 in negotiation

**4) STAKEHOLDER MAP (Top 5 Strategic Accounts)**
- Account A ($2.5M ARR): CIO (economic buyer, monthly), IT Dir (champion, weekly), 2 end-users (quarterly)
- Account B ($2.2M ARR): CFO (buyer, quarterly), Ops VP (champion, bi-weekly), CSO (influencer, as-needed)
- Account C ($2M ARR): CEO (sponsor, quarterly), CMO (buyer, monthly), 3 team leads (bi-weekly)
- Account D ($1.8M ARR): single-threaded (IT Manager); risk = no executive relationship
- Account E ($1.7M ARR): VP Ops (buyer, monthly), 2 analysts (weekly); champion recently promoted (opportunity)

**5) ISSUE & ESCALATION LOG**
- Account D: integration failure (P1, 12 days open, escalated to eng) — SLA breach
- Account F: training request unfulfilled (P2, 8 days open, AM owner)
- Account G: billing dispute (P2, 5 days open, finance resolving)
- Recurring themes: integration complexity (4 accounts), onboarding delays (3 accounts)
- SLA compliance: 92% overall; P1 = 85%, P2 = 95%

**6) 30/60/90-DAY RETENTION & GROWTH PLAN**
- 30 days: stabilize 8 at-risk accounts (executive sponsor engagement, remediation plans); complete Gainsight data cleanup
- 60 days: execute QBRs for 12 upcoming renewals; expand stakeholder mapping for single-threaded accounts
- 90 days: launch 6 expansion plays; formalize churn signal alerts (usage drop, CSAT <7, champion change)
- Metrics: GRR 95%+, NRR 120%, QBR completion 90%, expansion pipeline $5M

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Segment accounts by strategic value and tailor engagement intensity accordingly.
2) Multi-thread relationships early; never be single-threaded in strategic accounts.
3) Define success metrics collaboratively with the client at kickoff and revisit quarterly.
4) Track leading indicators of churn (usage trends, sentiment, engagement drop) not just lagging.
5) Conduct QBRs that demonstrate ROI and uncover expansion opportunities, not just status updates.
6) Respond to issues transparently with ownership, timelines, and follow-through.
7) Map renewals 90+ days in advance; treat every renewal as an expansion opportunity.
8) Build executive sponsor relationships for strategic accounts to enable long-term partnership.
