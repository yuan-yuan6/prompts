# Lean Six Sigma & Process Excellence Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to successfully implement Lean Six Sigma methodologies across six dimensions: Process Maturity, Data Capability, Methodology Expertise, Culture, Leadership, and Resources. Identify gaps, prioritize capability building, and create a roadmap for achieving operational excellence.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive Lean Six Sigma readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization planning to implement {IMPROVEMENT_SCOPE} targeting {TARGET_METRICS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. PROCESS MATURITY & DOCUMENTATION**
- Process identification and mapping completeness
- Standard operating procedures and work instructions
- Process ownership and accountability clarity
- Baseline process capability (Cp, Cpk, sigma level)
- Current defect rates, cycle times, and yield metrics
- Process variation understanding and control

**2. DATA & MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY**
- Data collection systems and automation level
- Measurement system accuracy and reliability (MSA, Gage R&R)
- Statistical data availability (defects, cycle times, costs)
- Data integrity, completeness, and timeliness
- Process monitoring infrastructure (sensors, logging, tracking)
- Analytics tools and reporting capabilities

**3. METHODOLOGY & TOOLS EXPERTISE**
- DMAIC methodology knowledge and application experience
- Statistical analysis skills (hypothesis testing, regression, DOE)
- Lean tools mastery (value stream mapping, 5S, kanban, waste elimination)
- Six Sigma tools proficiency (control charts, capability analysis, root cause)
- Belt certification levels (Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt)
- Problem-solving and analytical capability depth

**4. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE & CHANGE READINESS**
- Continuous improvement mindset and commitment
- Data-driven decision making vs. intuition-based
- Cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Experimentation tolerance and learning from failure
- Employee engagement in improvement initiatives
- Recognition and reward systems for process excellence

**5. LEADERSHIP & GOVERNANCE**
- Executive sponsorship and visible commitment
- Resource allocation for improvement projects
- Governance structure (steering committee, project pipeline)
- Strategic alignment of improvement priorities
- Barrier removal and decision velocity
- Communication and change management effectiveness

**6. RESOURCES & INFRASTRUCTURE**
- Improvement team capacity (dedicated vs. part-time)
- Training budget and certification support
- Software tools (Minitab, statistical packages, project management)
- Facilitation and coaching resources
- Time allocation for project work
- External expertise access (consultants, MBBs)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score, maturity level, top 3 priorities, estimated investment and timeline

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5), maturity level, and key finding per dimension

3. **PROJECT PIPELINE READINESS** - For each proposed project, show readiness per dimension (✓/△/✗), estimated success probability, and recommended sequencing

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 capability gaps ranked by impact on success, with specific remediation actions and effort estimates

5. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Quarterly plan covering: Wave 1 pilot projects, capability building (training, tools, coaching), infrastructure development, culture transformation, and scaling approach

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Current baseline vs 6-month and 12-month targets for: sigma level, defect rates, cycle time, cost savings, project completion rate, belt certifications

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc processes, no formal methodology, limited data)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some documentation, basic tools, pilot projects)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (standardized approach, trained resources, active projects)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (integrated methodology, sustained results, scaled deployment)
- 5.0: Optimized (continuous innovation, industry benchmark, excellence culture)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Name of the organization | "MedTech Manufacturing" |
| `[TARGET_PROCESSES]` | Processes targeted for improvement | "production line, quality inspection, order fulfillment" |
| `[IMPROVEMENT_SCOPE]` | Scope of improvement initiative | "enterprise-wide process excellence program" |

## Example

**Automotive Manufacturing - Process Excellence Implementation**

> Assess Lean Six Sigma readiness for **TechParts Manufacturing** targeting **assembly line, quality control, and supply chain** with current **4.2%** defect rate and **3.1** sigma level. Evaluate across: (1) Process maturity—assembly processes documented with SOPs, baseline Cpk of 1.05, 87-minute cycle time tracked but high variation. (2) Data capability—manual defect logging, no automated SPC, limited Gage R&R validation. (3) Methodology expertise—2 Green Belts, no Black Belts, supervisors familiar with 5S but limited statistical skills. (4) Culture—quality-focused but reactive, limited cross-functional teams, low experimentation tolerance. (5) Leadership—VP Operations supportive but limited executive engagement, no formal improvement governance. (6) Resources—$150K training budget, Minitab licenses available, 10% capacity for improvement work. Provide maturity scorecard, gap analysis, pilot project recommendations targeting 30% defect reduction, and 12-month roadmap to 4.0 sigma level.
