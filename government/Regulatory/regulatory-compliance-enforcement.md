## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for government regulatory compliance programs, inspection procedures, enforcement actions, stakeholder education, and ensuring adherence to laws and regulations in regulated industries.

## Quick Start

**Need to manage regulatory compliance?** Use this minimal example:

```

### When to Use This
- Building regulatory compliance programs
- Conducting inspections and audits
- Enforcing regulations and issuing penalties
- Providing compliance assistance
- Measuring regulatory effectiveness

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Program Design** - Regulations, procedures, resources (2-3 months)
2. **Implementation** - Training, inspections, enforcement (ongoing)
3. **Evaluation** - Metrics, improvements, stakeholder feedback (quarterly)

**Time to complete**: Ongoing program, initial setup 3-6 months
