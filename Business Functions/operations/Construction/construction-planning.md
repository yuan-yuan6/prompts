# Construction Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan construction projects with reliable schedules, budgets, resource allocation, and risk controls.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess construction planning readiness for project [PROJECT]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Scope & requirements, (2) Schedule & critical path, (3) Cost & procurement, (4) Resource planning, (5) Risk & safety, (6) Governance & reporting. Provide a scorecard and planning checklist.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Scope & Requirements
- 1 — Initial: Scope unclear; frequent changes unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Requirements documented; change control exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Scope is stable with disciplined change management and stakeholder alignment.

### 2) Schedule & Critical Path
- 1 — Initial: Schedule is optimistic; dependencies unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Critical path and dependencies mapped; milestones defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Schedule is realistic and continuously updated based on field signals.

### 3) Cost & Procurement
- 1 — Initial: Budget incomplete; procurement reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Budget and procurement plan defined; vendor strategy exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Cost control is mature; forecasting and variance management are reliable.

### 4) Resource Planning
- 1 — Initial: Labor/equipment constraints unplanned.
- 3 — Defined: Resource plan and constraints documented; allocations tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Resource utilization is optimized; bottlenecks addressed proactively.

### 5) Risk & Safety
- 1 — Initial: Risks undocumented; safety planning minimal.
- 3 — Defined: Risk register and safety plan exist; mitigations tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Risk and safety are managed proactively with strong field adherence.

### 6) Governance & Reporting
- 1 — Initial: Reporting inconsistent; decision-making slow.
- 3 — Defined: Cadence, owners, and dashboards defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance is effective; issues escalate quickly and transparently.

## Deliverables
- Planning readiness scorecard and risk register
- Integrated schedule with dependencies and milestones
- Budget and procurement plan
- Resource plan (labor, equipment, materials)
- Governance cadence and reporting pack

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROJECT]: Project name
- [SCOPE]: Scope
- [SCHEDULE]: Target dates
- [BUDGET]: Budget
- [RESOURCES]: Resource constraints
- [RISKS]: Key risks

## Example (Condensed)
- Project: Mid-rise commercial build
- Scores (1–5): Scope 3; Schedule 2; Cost 2; Resources 2; Risk/Safety 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Clarify dependencies; build procurement plan; improve forecasting and reporting cadence
