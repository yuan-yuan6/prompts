# Property Management System Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to select and implement a property management system (PMS) with clear requirements, data migration, integrations, adoption, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess PMS implementation readiness for [PORTFOLIO] with [UNIT_COUNT] units and current tools [CURRENT_SYSTEMS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Requirements & scope, (2) Data migration readiness, (3) Integrations & workflows, (4) Security & compliance, (5) Change management & adoption, (6) Measurement & stabilization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and an implementation plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Requirements & Scope
- 1 — Initial: Requirements unclear; scope creep likely.
- 3 — Defined: Requirements and success criteria documented; scope and constraints defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scope is prioritized; decisions are fast; requirements evolve with evidence.

### 2) Data Migration Readiness
- 1 — Initial: Data quality unknown; migration approach unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Data inventory, mapping, and QA plan; owners assigned.
- 5 — Optimized: Migration is repeatable; data quality is monitored; cutover risk reduced.

### 3) Integrations & Workflows
- 1 — Initial: Workflows undefined; integrations are afterthoughts.
- 3 — Defined: Core workflows mapped; integration needs documented (accounting, CRM, portals).
- 5 — Optimized: Integrations are reliable; automation reduces manual work significantly.

### 4) Security & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Access controls unclear; compliance requirements not addressed.
- 3 — Defined: Security requirements and roles; audit logs; data retention rules.
- 5 — Optimized: Controls are tested; incidents are rare; compliance is auditable.

### 5) Change Management & Adoption
- 1 — Initial: Training is minimal; adoption risks high.
- 3 — Defined: Training plan, champions, and support; rollout plan.
- 5 — Optimized: Adoption is measured; workflows are refined; teams self-serve.

### 6) Measurement & Stabilization
- 1 — Initial: No stabilization plan; issues linger post-launch.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs for cutover, defects, and operations; stabilization backlog.
- 5 — Optimized: System performance and processes improve continuously after launch.

## Deliverables
- PMS readiness scorecard and prioritized gaps
- Requirements and workflow map
- Data migration plan (inventory, mapping, QA, cutover)
- Integration plan and security requirements
- Adoption and stabilization plan with KPIs

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PORTFOLIO]: Portfolio/buildings
- [UNIT_COUNT]: Unit count
- [CURRENT_SYSTEMS]: Current tools/systems
- [PMS_VENDOR]: Candidate vendor
- [INTEGRATIONS]: Accounting, payments, portals
- [CUTOVER_DATE]: Target cutover date

## Example (Condensed)
- Portfolio: 2,000-unit portfolio migrating from spreadsheets and legacy accounting
- Scores (1–5): Requirements 3; Migration 2; Integrations 2; Security 3; Adoption 2; Stabilization 2
- 90-day priorities: Inventory data + QA; map workflows; define integration scope; create training and stabilization plans
