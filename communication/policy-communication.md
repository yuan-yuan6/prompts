# Policy Communication & Training Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for effectively communicating policy changes, updates, and new implementations while ensuring compliance training, awareness campaigns, and successful adoption across the organization.

## Quick Start

Roll out your policy effectively in 3 phases:

1. **Prepare Your Foundation** (Week 1) - Create a one-page policy summary that answers: What's changing? Why? Who's affected? When does it take effect? What do I need to do? Convert complex policy language into plain English with concrete examples. Develop an FAQ document addressing the top 10-15 questions you anticipate.

2. **Execute Multi-Channel Launch** (Week 2) - Announce through 3+ channels on the same day: (1) Leadership email explaining rationale, (2) Manager talking points for team meetings, (3) Intranet post with full details, (4) Posters/digital signage for high-visibility areas. Repetition across channels ensures the message reaches everyone.

3. **Provide Support & Reinforcement** (Weeks 3-4) - Schedule Q&A sessions where employees can ask questions in real-time. Create short video tutorials or visual guides for complex procedures. Set up a help desk or email address for ongoing questions. Send weekly reminders with compliance deadlines and quick tips.

**Pro Tip**: Focus on the "why" before the "what." Employees are more likely to comply when they understand the business rationale, legal requirements, or risk mitigation behind the policy. Lead with purpose, not penalties.
