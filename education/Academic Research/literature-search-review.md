# Literature Search and Review Methodology

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive, systematic literature searches and synthesize existing research to build theoretical foundations, identify knowledge gaps, and establish the evidence base for new research investigations.

## Template

```
You are an expert in literature review methodology and evidence synthesis with extensive experience in systematic search strategies, critical appraisal, and knowledge integration. Create a comprehensive literature review framework based on the following information:

Research Context:

- Discipline/Field: [RESEARCH_FIELD]
- Review Type: [REVIEW_TYPE]
- Time Period: [LITERATURE_TIMEFRAME]
- Geographic Scope: [GEOGRAPHIC_SCOPE]
- Languages: [LANGUAGE_LIMITATIONS]

Generate a detailed literature search and review strategy that includes:

## 1. LITERATURE REVIEW PLANNING

- Type of review (narrative, systematic, scoping, meta-analysis)
- Intended audience and use
- Timeline and resource constraints

#### Scope Parameters
- Temporal boundaries (years covered)
- Geographic limitations
- Language restrictions
- Publication types included
- Population or context focus
- Disciplinary boundaries
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria

### Review Protocol Development
- Systematic approach to searching
- Standardized screening procedures
- Quality assessment criteria
- Data extraction methods
- Synthesis approach
- Timeline and milestones
- Team roles and responsibilities
- Documentation requirements

## 2. SEARCH STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT

### Database Selection
#### Primary Databases
- Discipline-specific databases:
  * PubMed/MEDLINE (health sciences)
  * ERIC (education)
  * PsycINFO (psychology)
  * Web of Science (multidisciplinary)
  * Scopus (multidisciplinary)
  * JSTOR (humanities, social sciences)
  * IEEE Xplore (engineering, computer science)
  * Business Source Complete (business)

#### Supplementary Sources
- Grey literature databases
- Dissertation and thesis repositories
- Government databases and reports
- Conference proceedings
- Clinical trial registries
- Preprint servers (arXiv, medRxiv, bioRxiv)
- Institutional repositories
- Specialized subject repositories

### Search Term Development
#### Keyword Identification
- Core concepts from research question
- Synonyms and related terms
- Alternative spellings and variations
- Acronyms and abbreviations
- Historical and contemporary terminology
- Discipline-specific language
- Controlled vocabulary (MeSH, subject headings)

#### Search String Construction
- Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT):
  * AND: Narrows search (combines different concepts)
  * OR: Broadens search (synonyms, related terms)
  * NOT: Excludes terms (use cautiously)

- Phrase searching:
  * Use quotation marks for exact phrases
  * "systematic review" vs systematic review

- Truncation and wildcards:
  * * for multiple character variations (child* = child, children, childhood)
  * ? for single character variations (wom?n = woman, women)

- Proximity operators:
  * NEAR, ADJ, W/n for words near each other
  * Example: leadership NEAR/5 effectiveness

- Field-specific searching:
  * Title, abstract, keywords, author, year
  * TI("climate change") - search only in title

#### Example Search Strategy
```
(("research design*" OR methodology OR "research method*")
AND ("higher education" OR university OR college*)
AND (student* OR undergraduate*)
AND (engagement OR motivation OR persistence))
NOT ("K-12" OR secondary OR "high school")
```

### Search Filters and Limits
