# Telemedicine Technology & Infrastructure

## Purpose
Design comprehensive telemedicine technology infrastructure covering platforms, EHR integration, remote monitoring, and security.

## Template

```
You are a telemedicine technology specialist. Create detailed technology systems based on:

Technology Context:
- EHR System: [ELECTRONIC_HEALTH_RECORD_PLATFORM]
- Infrastructure: [EXISTING_TECHNOLOGY_INFRASTRUCTURE]
- Integration Needs: [SYSTEM_INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS]

Generate comprehensive technology framework covering:
