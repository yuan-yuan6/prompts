# Smart Grid Implementation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to implement smart grid capabilities including AMI, distribution automation, DER integration, and operational processes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess smart grid implementation readiness for program [PROGRAM]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Use cases & value, (2) Architecture & integration, (3) Data/telemetry & cybersecurity, (4) Operations & change management, (5) Vendor delivery & rollout, (6) Governance & compliance. Provide a scorecard and rollout roadmap.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Use Cases & Value
- 1 — Initial: Use cases unclear; value not measured.
- 3 — Defined: Use cases prioritized; KPIs and benefits defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Value is measured and optimized; scaling decisions are evidence-based.

### 2) Architecture & Integration
- 1 — Initial: Architecture unclear; systems siloed.
- 3 — Defined: Target architecture and integration plan documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Integration is robust; changes managed without breaking operations.

### 3) Data/Telemetry & Cybersecurity
- 1 — Initial: Telemetry incomplete; security controls weak.
- 3 — Defined: Telemetry coverage and security controls defined; monitoring exists.
- 5 — Optimized: High-quality telemetry and mature security support safe automation.

### 4) Operations & Change Management
- 1 — Initial: Ops model unclear; adoption low.
- 3 — Defined: Ops workflows, training, and support model defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are mature; adoption is high and sustained.

### 5) Vendor Delivery & Rollout
- 1 — Initial: Vendors unmanaged; rollout risky.
- 3 — Defined: Vendor plan, rollout stages, and acceptance criteria defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Rollout is reliable with strong QA, backout plans, and learning loops.

### 6) Governance & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Governance absent; compliance uncertain.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence and compliance mapping exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance supports audits and continuous improvement.

## Deliverables
- Smart grid readiness scorecard
- Use-case portfolio and KPI framework
- Target architecture and integration plan
- Cybersecurity and telemetry plan
- Rollout roadmap with governance and training

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROGRAM]: Program name
- [USE_CASES]: Use cases
- [ARCH]: Architecture
- [TELEMETRY]: Telemetry
- [SECURITY]: Security controls
- [ROLLOUT]: Rollout plan

## Example (Condensed)
- Program: AMI + outage management integration
- Scores (1–5): Value 2; Architecture 2; Security 2; Ops 2; Rollout 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Define target architecture; strengthen security monitoring; clarify ops workflows; set governance cadence
