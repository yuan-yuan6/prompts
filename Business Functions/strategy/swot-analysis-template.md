# SWOT Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your organization can run a SWOT analysis that is evidence-based, unbiased, and actionable. This focuses on inputs, facilitation, synthesis, and follow-through.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess SWOT readiness for [ORGANIZATION] in [INDUSTRY] evaluating [SCOPE] over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Evidence quality, (2) Stakeholder participation & facilitation, (3) Analytical rigor (SO/WO/ST/WT), (4) Prioritization & actionability, (5) Governance & integration into planning, (6) Communication & follow-through. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 30–60 day plan to improve the next SWOT cycle.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Evidence Quality
- 1 — Initial: SWOT inputs are opinion-driven; sources are missing; market and internal performance data are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Inputs reference sources; internal and external data are summarized; assumptions are visible.
- 5 — Optimized: Evidence is triangulated; uncertainties are labeled; inputs are refreshed on a cadence.

### 2) Stakeholder Participation & Facilitation
- 1 — Initial: Workshop is dominated by a few voices; limited cross-functional representation.
- 3 — Defined: Representation is planned; facilitation keeps focus; pre-work is collected.
- 5 — Optimized: Structured facilitation reduces bias; participation is balanced; dissent is captured and resolved.

### 3) Analytical Rigor (SO/WO/ST/WT)
- 1 — Initial: Lists are long; categories overlap; no synthesis into strategic implications.
- 3 — Defined: Clear definitions for each quadrant; SO/WO/ST/WT synthesis generates coherent options.
- 5 — Optimized: SWOT connects to competitive dynamics; options are tested against constraints and scenarios.

### 4) Prioritization & Actionability
- 1 — Initial: Outputs are not prioritized; actions are vague; owners and timelines are missing.
- 3 — Defined: Prioritization criteria exist; actions have owners, timelines, and measures.
- 5 — Optimized: Actions are sequenced by dependencies and capacity; outcomes are tracked to realized impact.

### 5) Governance & Integration into Planning
- 1 — Initial: SWOT is a one-off exercise; it does not connect to planning or budgeting.
- 3 — Defined: SWOT informs annual planning; governance exists to accept or reject actions.
- 5 — Optimized: SWOT is part of a recurring strategic rhythm; insights feed OKRs, roadmaps, and investment gates.

### 6) Communication & Follow-Through
- 1 — Initial: Outputs are not shared consistently; follow-up is not tracked.
- 3 — Defined: Summary and decisions are communicated; action tracking exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Stakeholders see progress; learning is captured; communication supports alignment and accountability.

## Deliverables
- SWOT readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Evidence pack requirements (internal metrics, market data, competitor signals)
- Prioritization rubric (impact, feasibility, urgency, strategic fit)
- Action register template (owner, milestone, metric, status)
- 30–60 day plan for improved facilitation and follow-through

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [SCOPE]: Scope (company, BU, product line)
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 12–24 months)
- [STAKEHOLDERS]: Participants and roles

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Manufacturer evaluating expansion into a new channel
- Scores (1–5): Evidence 2; Facilitation 3; Rigor 2; Actionability 2; Governance 2; Follow-through 2
- Top gaps: Unreferenced market sizing, weak synthesis, no ownership for actions
- 30–60 day priorities: Define evidence pack; run structured workshop; apply prioritization rubric; publish action register
