# Product-Market Fit Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess product-market fit across six dimensions: Customer Love, Retention Quality, Growth Dynamics, Value Delivery, Market Positioning, and Business Viability. This framework identifies gaps preventing PMF achievement, validates product-market alignment through quantitative and qualitative signals, and creates actionable roadmaps to reach strong product-market fit.

## 🚀 Quick PMF Assessment Prompt

> Assess **product-market fit** for **[PRODUCT/COMPANY]** serving **[TARGET MARKET]** at **[STAGE]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Customer love**—what's Sean Ellis PMF score (% "very disappointed")? Do customers actively refer? Are testimonials passionate? (2) **Retention quality**—do cohort curves flatten or decline? What's Month 1 and Month 3 retention? (3) **Growth dynamics**—what % of signups are organic? Is viral coefficient >1? Word-of-mouth attribution? (4) **Value delivery**—do customers achieve core outcomes? Time-to-value acceptable? Clear "aha moment"? (5) **Market positioning**—is ICP validated? Differentiation clear? Win rate strong? (6) **Business viability**—is LTV:CAC ratio >3? Payback period <12 months? Provide a maturity scorecard (1-5 per dimension), PMF gaps, segment analysis, and 90-day action plan to achieve strong PMF.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid PMF evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive product-market fit assessment for {PRODUCT_CONTEXT}, serving {TARGET_MARKET} to achieve {PMF_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Customer Love Readiness**

Assess whether customers would be very disappointed losing access to your product. Evaluate Sean Ellis PMF score including survey results asking how disappointed users would be if product became unavailable with benchmark of forty percent or higher selecting very disappointed indicating strong PMF. Examine emotional intensity determining whether customer testimonials express genuine passion, solve critical problems, and use language like love, can't live without, or game-changer rather than lukewarm nice-to-have sentiment. Review referral behavior including whether customers actively recommend product without incentives, serve as reference accounts willingly, and recruit colleagues or friends organically. Analyze power user identification determining whether specific customer segment demonstrates obsessive usage, deep engagement, and missionary zeal that reveals who truly needs solution. Assess Net Promoter Score including whether score exceeds thirty indicating good PMF with promoters significantly outnumbering detractors and clear reasons why advocates recommend product. Evaluate customer resistance to alternatives determining whether users who try competitors return quickly, express dissatisfaction with substitutes, and demonstrate sticky behavior patterns indicating genuine product-market fit.

**2. Retention Quality Readiness**

Evaluate whether customers stick around indicating product delivers ongoing value. Assess cohort retention curves including whether Month 1 retention exceeds forty percent, Month 3 retention shows flattening rather than continued decline, and newer cohorts perform better than older ones signaling product improvements. Examine retention by segment determining whether specific customer types, use cases, or industries demonstrate dramatically stronger retention revealing true ICP versus poor-fit customers. Review churn reasons including whether departures stem from product gaps, wrong customer fit, or external factors with product-related churn indicating PMF issues requiring iteration. Analyze resurrection patterns determining whether churned users return after trying alternatives, what triggers their comeback, and whether win-back rates indicate latent product value. Assess engagement consistency including whether daily-to-monthly active user ratios exceed twenty percent, session frequency remains stable, and feature usage depth increases over time. Evaluate expansion behavior determining whether retained customers naturally increase spending through seat growth, usage expansion, or feature adoption without aggressive sales pushing.

**3. Growth Dynamics Readiness**

Assess whether product grows through customer pull rather than company push. Evaluate organic growth percentage including whether thirty percent or more signups attribute to word-of-mouth, content, or brand search rather than paid advertising indicating market pull. Examine viral coefficient determining whether each customer brings additional users with k-factor approaching or exceeding one creating self-sustaining growth loops. Review sales cycle trends including whether time-to-close shortens over time, objection frequency decreases, and deals progress with less effort indicating product selling itself. Analyze inbound demand including whether unsolicited demo requests increase, waitlist grows without promotion, and customers discover product through community or press mentions. Assess competitive win rates determining whether displacement of incumbents occurs frequently, switching motivations are strong, and new market creation versus replacement dynamics reveal category strength. Evaluate media and community buzz including whether organic press coverage, social media mentions, analyst recognition, and industry awards emerge without PR investment.

**4. Value Delivery Readiness**

Evaluate whether customers achieve intended outcomes demonstrating problem-solution fit. Assess outcome achievement including whether customers report measurable results like time saved, revenue increased, or costs reduced that justify continued investment and expansion. Examine time-to-value including whether customers reach aha moment within days or weeks rather than months, activation rates exceed fifty percent, and onboarding friction is minimal. Review use case validation determining whether customers use product for intended purposes versus discovering unexpected applications that might reveal better product-market alignment. Analyze value perception including whether customers would pay significantly more than current price indicating value-price gap and room for optimization, or whether price resistance signals insufficient value delivery. Assess feature utilization determining whether customers engage deeply with core features rather than spreading usage thinly across many capabilities suggesting unclear value proposition. Evaluate customer success patterns including whether successful customers follow predictable paths, hit common milestones, and exhibit behaviors that can be replicated with new users.

**5. Market Positioning Readiness**

Assess whether product serves clearly defined segment with validated differentiation. Evaluate ICP clarity including whether ideal customer profile is specific beyond vague descriptions, validated through data showing concentrated PMF scores by segment, and targetable through marketing channels. Examine segment PMF variation determining whether specific industries, company sizes, or personas demonstrate forty-plus percent PMF scores while others show weak fit revealing where to focus. Review positioning effectiveness including whether value proposition resonates immediately, differentiation from alternatives is obvious to customers, and messaging reflects customer language rather than internal jargon. Analyze competitive displacement determining whether customers switching from specific competitors converts at higher rates, certain incumbent weaknesses create opportunities, and win-loss analysis reveals predictable patterns. Assess market timing including whether customer awareness of problem is increasing, regulatory or technology shifts create urgency, and category growth supports expansion versus declining or stable markets. Evaluate total addressable market determining whether beachhead segment is large enough to build business, expansion segments are accessible, and market sizing is based on bottoms-up analysis rather than top-down assumptions.

**6. Business Viability Readiness**

Evaluate whether unit economics support sustainable growth at scale. Assess LTV-to-CAC ratio including whether customer lifetime value exceeds acquisition cost by three times or more indicating healthy economics that support growth investment. Examine payback period determining whether customer acquisition costs are recovered within twelve months through subscription revenue, usage fees, or expansion enabling rapid reinvestment. Review gross margin structure including whether delivery costs decrease with scale, unit economics improve over time, and margin supports thirty-plus percent operating margin at maturity. Analyze revenue retention including whether net revenue retention exceeds one hundred percent through expansion, upsells offset churn, and cohorts become more valuable over time. Assess pricing power determining whether price increases are accepted without significant churn, discounting decreases over time, and expansion revenue occurs naturally indicating customers perceive ongoing value growth. Evaluate monetization alignment determining whether business model captures value delivered, customers can afford product relative to ROI generated, and payment frequency matches value realization cadence.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **PMF Overview** providing current PMF score from Sean Ellis test, retention metrics summary, organic growth percentage, and overall maturity assessment.

2. **Dimension Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Segment Analysis** showing PMF scores by customer segment, identifying strongest and weakest fit, and recommending segment prioritization strategy.

4. **PMF Gap Analysis** identifying critical gaps preventing strong PMF ranked by impact, with specific hypotheses about root causes and validation approaches.

5. **90-Day Action Plan** providing immediate experiments to run, product iterations to prioritize, customer research to conduct, and success metrics to track.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what strong PMF looks like including forty-plus percent Sean Ellis score, flattening retention curves, thirty-plus percent organic growth, and viable unit economics.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Pre-PMF with weak signals across dimensions, 2.0-2.9 Emerging PMF in specific segments but gaps remain, 3.0-3.9 Medium PMF with solid foundation but scaling challenges, 4.0-4.9 Strong PMF ready for aggressive growth investment, 5.0 Exceptional PMF with market pull and stellar metrics.

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}` | Product stage, team size, and current traction | "early-stage B2B SaaS with MVP launched six months ago, 1,200 users, $50K MRR, three-person product team" |
| `{TARGET_MARKET}` | Customer segments and industries being served | "marketing teams at 50-500 person technology companies needing collaborative content planning and approval workflows" |
| `{PMF_OBJECTIVES}` | PMF goals and timeline expectations | "achieving 45% PMF score, 50% Month 3 retention, and 30% organic growth within three months to justify Series A fundraising" |

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Pre-PMF**

Conduct a comprehensive product-market fit assessment for a venture-backed B2B SaaS startup twelve months post-launch with 2,500 total users, thirty-five percent Month 1 retention, and fifteen percent organic growth indicating struggle to find strong PMF despite reasonable traction metrics, serving project management needs for creative agencies ranging from ten to one hundred employees with focus on client collaboration and approval workflows, to achieve forty-five percent Sean Ellis PMF score, fifty-five percent Month 3 retention, and thirty-five percent organic signups within ninety days enabling confident go-to-market scaling investment. The assessment should address segment variation determining whether boutique agencies under twenty employees show stronger signals than larger shops, value delivery gaps examining why thirty-five percent retention suggests activation issues or wrong customer fit, competitive positioning against incumbents like Asana and Monday.com revealing whether differentiation resonates, and unit economics validation ensuring LTV:CAC ratio supports growth before scaling.

**Example 2: Consumer Mobile App Finding PMF**

Conduct a comprehensive product-market fit assessment for a bootstrapped consumer mobile app eight months post-launch with fifty thousand downloads, forty-two percent Sean Ellis score among weekly active users but only twelve percent of downloads becoming weekly actives indicating strong PMF with engaged segment but weak activation, serving personal productivity and habit tracking for young professionals aged twenty-five to thirty-five seeking behavior change support, to achieve sixty percent activation rate from download to weekly usage, fifty percent Sean Ellis score across all activated users, and strong viral growth with k-factor exceeding 0.7 within six months. The assessment should address activation barriers determining why eighty-eight percent of downloads never become engaged users, power user analysis revealing what differentiates weekly actives who love product from casual users, monetization readiness examining whether engaged users would pay given strong emotional attachment, and growth loop optimization determining which viral mechanics drive sharing among power users.

**Example 3: Enterprise Platform Pivoting**

Conduct a comprehensive product-market fit assessment for a Series A enterprise software company two years in market with one hundred customers, thirty-two percent Sean Ellis score, and sixty percent gross revenue retention indicating weak PMF requiring strategic pivot decision, serving general business analytics across multiple industries and company sizes from SMB to enterprise with horizontal platform approach, to achieve clarity on whether to double down on specific vertical showing stronger signals, pivot to different target market, or fundamentally redesign product within four months before runway concerns force difficult decisions. The assessment should address segment PMF variation examining whether retail customers show fifty-plus percent PMF score while other verticals are weak, ICP refinement determining if mid-market versus enterprise or specific use cases demonstrate concentrated love, competitive positioning against incumbents and category-specific tools revealing whether horizontal approach is viable, and pivot-or-persevere framework helping leadership make confident strategic decision based on data.
