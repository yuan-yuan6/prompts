# UX/UI Design - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
This overview guide helps you navigate the UX/UI design prompt collection and select the appropriate template for your specific design deliverable needs.

## Quick UX Navigation Prompt
I need to design [product type] for [user group]. Current phase: [discovery/wireframing/prototyping/testing/handoff]. Primary goal: [validate concept/test usability/create design system/build prototype]. Guide me to the right template and provide a 3-step workflow with estimated time. Constraints: [timeline] and [team size].

## Quick Start

**Want to design user interfaces quickly?** Here's how to choose the right template:

### When to Use This Overview
- Starting a new UI/UX design project
- Need specific design deliverables (wireframes, prototypes, design systems)
- Planning user testing or validation
- Building design documentation
- Unsure which design artifact to create first

### Quick Template Selection
```
Your Design Need → Recommended Template:

1. Structure layouts and plan information architecture
   → wireframe-design.md (Sitemap, wireframes, navigation, 1-2 days)

2. Create interactive prototypes for testing
   → prototype-development.md (Clickable mockups, animations, 2-3 days)

3. Build scalable design system or component library
   → design-system-creation.md (Components, tokens, guidelines, 1-2 weeks)

4. Plan and conduct usability testing
   → usability-testing-plan.md (Test plan, scripts, analysis, 1 week)
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Start with wireframes** - Use wireframe-design.md to plan structure and layout
2. **Build prototype** - Use prototype-development.md to create interactive mockup
3. **Test with users** - Use usability-testing-plan.md to validate design decisions

**Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks for basic UI design cycle, 3-4 weeks with full design system

**Pro tip**: Go low-fidelity first. Start with simple wireframes to validate structure before investing time in high-fidelity visuals or comprehensive design systems.

**Copy-paste this prompt:**

```
I'm leading a UX redesign of our B2B project management SaaS product. Users report the interface is
confusing and they can't find features. NPS is 15 (down from 35 two years ago).

CURRENT STATE:
- Product: Web-based project management for teams (5-50 users per company)
- Users: Project managers, team leads, individual contributors
- Pain points: Navigation confusing, too many clicks to complete tasks, mobile unusable
- Existing design: No design system, inconsistent patterns, 5 years of feature additions
- Team: 2 product designers, 1 UX researcher, 8 engineers
- Timeline: 16 weeks to first major release

GOALS:
- Improve task completion time by 30%
- Increase NPS from 15 to 35
- Reduce support tickets related to "how do I..." by 50%
- Make mobile actually usable (currently 2% mobile usage vs. 60% competitor)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Can't change data model or remove features (users rely on them)
- Must maintain brand colors and logo
- Rollout must be gradual (users hate sudden changes)
- Limited user research budget ($10K for external testing)

QUESTIONS:
1. Which UX/UI templates should I use and in what order?
2. How do I balance comprehensive redesign with gradual rollout?
3. Should I build a design system during this project or after?
4. How many rounds of usability testing are realistic with $10K budget?

Please provide a phased UX redesign plan with template sequence and timeline.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Wireframe Design - Information architecture audit, new navigation structure
- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Prototype Development - Interactive prototype of core workflows
- Phase 3 (Weeks 9-10): Usability Testing - 8-10 users, 2 rounds of testing
- Phase 4 (Weeks 11-16): Design System foundation + implementation
- Gradual rollout strategy: Feature flags, opt-in beta, phased by customer segment

### Example 2: Mobile App MVP

**Context:** Startup building mobile app MVP for consumer fitness tracking

**Copy-paste this prompt:**

```
I'm the sole designer at a startup building a fitness tracking mobile app. We need to launch MVP in
8 weeks to hit our seed funding milestone. I've never built a design system before.

PRODUCT:
- App: iOS and Android fitness tracking (workout logging, progress photos, social features)
- Target users: Fitness enthusiasts aged 25-40, intermediate to advanced
- Competition: Strong (MyFitnessPal, Strava, Nike Training Club)
- Differentiator: AI-powered form analysis from workout videos

TEAM:
- 1 designer (me), 2 iOS developers, 1 Android developer, 1 backend developer
- Engineering lead has strong opinions about feasibility
- CEO wants "premium feel" but hasn't defined what that means

CONSTRAINTS:
- 8 weeks total (MVP must be in App Store)
- No budget for user research (will use guerrilla testing at local gym)
- Must work on both iOS and Android (React Native)
- Need to support accessibility (client has visual impairment)

QUESTIONS:
1. With only 8 weeks, which UX templates are essential vs. nice-to-have?
2. How do I create enough design structure for 2 platforms without a full design system?
3. What's the minimum viable usability testing I can do with $0 budget?
4. How do I align the CEO on "premium feel" without delaying the project?

Please provide an 8-week design sprint plan focused on MVP delivery.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Week 1: Wireframe Design (core 5-7 screens only) + stakeholder alignment on "premium"
- Weeks 2-3: Prototype Development (high-fidelity for core workout flow)
- Week 4: Guerrilla usability testing (5 users at gym, 30-min sessions)
- Weeks 5-6: Iteration + component library foundation (not full design system)
- Weeks 7-8: Polish + developer support + App Store assets
- Mini design system: 10 core components, color tokens, typography scale

### Example 3: Enterprise Design System

**Context:** Large enterprise standardizing design across 15 product teams

**Copy-paste this prompt:**

```
I'm the design systems lead at a Fortune 500 company. We have 15 product teams, each with their own
design patterns. Leadership wants consistency across all products within 18 months.

CURRENT STATE:
- Products: 15 internal and external applications (web and mobile)
- Teams: 40 designers, 200 engineers across all products
- Existing patterns: Each team has informal patterns, no documentation
- Tools: Mix of Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD (want to standardize on Figma)
- Tech stack: React (8 products), Angular (4), Vue (2), Native mobile (1)

CHALLENGES:
- Teams are protective of their designs ("not invented here" syndrome)
- No dedicated design system team (I'm 50% allocated)
- Leadership wants "one design" but products have legitimately different needs
- Engineers frustrated with constant design changes

GOALS:
- Unified design language across all products (brand consistency)
- Reduce design-to-dev handoff time by 40%
- Enable teams to ship faster with pre-built components
- Improve accessibility compliance (currently failing audits)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Can't mandate adoption (need to earn trust)
- Different products have different release schedules
- Limited budget for design tokens infrastructure
- Must support multiple frameworks (can't standardize tech stack)

QUESTIONS:
1. How do I build a design system that accommodates different product needs?
2. What's the right sequence: documentation, components, tokens, or governance?
3. How do I drive adoption without mandating it?
4. How should I structure usability testing for the design system itself?

Please provide an 18-month design system rollout strategy.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Months 1-3: Design System Creation foundations - audit, tokens, core components
- Months 4-6: Pilot with 2-3 willing teams, iterate based on feedback
- Months 7-9: Expand to 5-7 teams, build comprehensive component library
- Months 10-12: Full rollout, training program, contribution model
- Months 13-18: Maintenance, governance, continuous improvement
- Adoption strategy: Early adopter incentives, showcase wins, reduce friction
- Usability Testing: Test components with product teams as users
