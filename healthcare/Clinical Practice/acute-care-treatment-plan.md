# Acute Care Treatment Plan

## Purpose
Develop rapid, evidence-based treatment plans for acute care and emergency scenarios requiring immediate intervention, stabilization, and time-sensitive decision-making.

## Quick Start

**Rapid Acute Care Treatment Plan:**

1. **STAT Assessment (0-5 min)** - ABCs, vital signs, GCS, chief complaint; document time of onset and arrival
2. **Immediate Stabilization (0-15 min)** - Airway management, O2 therapy, IV access, cardiac monitoring per protocol
3. **HIPAA-Compliant Emergency Communication** - Obtain verbal consent when possible; use emergency exception for life-threatening situations; document rationale
4. **Diagnostic Workup (STAT)** - Order critical labs, imaging per protocol; use verbal orders with read-back confirmation
5. **Time-Critical Interventions** - Document all interventions with precise timestamps (e.g., tPA administration, defibrillation)
6. **Consult & Coordinate** - Activate appropriate response teams (stroke, STEMI, trauma); document all communications
7. **Family Notification** - Follow institutional policies; provide information while maintaining patient privacy; document who received information

**Emergency HIPAA Considerations:** Emergency treatment exception allows disclosure without consent when patient unable to agree; document incapacity and medical necessity. Secure all patient information immediately after stabilization.

URGENCY_LEVEL: "Urgent - Immediate stabilization needed"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Time is critical** - Document all intervention times precisely
2. **ABC priority** - Always address Airway, Breathing, Circulation first
3. **Continuous reassessment** - Frequently reassess response to interventions
4. **Clear communication** - Use structured communication (SBAR, closed-loop)
5. **Anticipate deterioration** - Have contingency plans ready
6. **Family involvement** - Keep family informed of critical decisions
7. **Resource mobilization** - Activate necessary teams and resources early
8. **Safety protocols** - Follow emergency safety checklists
9. **Documentation in real-time** - Record critical decisions and times immediately
10. **Transition planning** - Plan disposition early in the care process

## Tips for Success

- Use time-based checklists for critical interventions
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities in emergency team
- Maintain situational awareness of all pending actions
- Communicate critical findings immediately to team
- Have backup plans for all time-sensitive interventions
- Use simulation and drills to prepare for high-acuity scenarios
- Ensure availability of emergency equipment and medications
- Follow evidence-based protocols for common emergencies
- Debrief after critical events to identify improvements
- Stay current with emergency medicine guidelines and updates
