# Retirement Planning Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive retirement strategies including 401k optimization, IRA planning, income projections, and withdrawal strategies to ensure financial security and lifestyle maintenance throughout retirement years.

## Quick Start

Start your retirement planning in 3 steps:

1. **Calculate Your Retirement Number** - Determine:
   - Current age and target retirement age
   - Desired annual retirement income (typically 70-80% of current income)
   - Current retirement account balances
   - Years until retirement and expected lifespan

2. **Input Key Variables** - Begin with these essential fields:
   - `CURRENT_AGE`: Your age today
   - `RETIREMENT_AGE`: When you plan to retire (e.g., 65)
   - `CURRENT_INCOME`: Your annual salary
   - `RETIREMENT_INCOME_GOAL`: Desired retirement income
   - `CURRENT_RETIREMENT_BALANCE`: Total in all retirement accounts
   - `RISK_TOLERANCE`: Your comfort with investment risk

3. **Maximize Immediate Opportunities** - Take these actions now:
   - Contribute enough to get full employer 401(k) match
   - Set up automatic contribution increases
   - Review and optimize your investment allocation
   - Calculate your savings gap and monthly contribution needed

**Pro Tip**: If you're behind on savings, focus first on maxing out employer match (free money), then increase contributions by 1% every 6 months until you reach 15% of income.
