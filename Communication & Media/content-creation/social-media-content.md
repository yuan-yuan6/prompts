## Template

Create {CONTENT_TYPE} for {PLATFORM} targeting {AUDIENCE_SEGMENT} ({AGE_RANGE}, {INTERESTS}, {BEHAVIORS}) promoting {PRODUCT/CAMPAIGN} with {BRAND_VOICE} achieving {OBJECTIVE} ({ENGAGEMENT_RATE}% engagement, {CONVERSION_GOAL}).

**PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION**

Instagram—Content Formats: Feed posts (1080×1080 carousel 3-10 slides storytelling, single image high-impact visual, text-heavy infographic), Reels (9:16 vertical 15-90 seconds, trending audio first 3 seconds, hook in first frame, text overlays for sound-off viewing, captions for accessibility), Stories (24-hour ephemeral, polls/questions/quizzes for engagement, swipe-up links if 10K+ followers or verified), Lives (authentic Q&A, product launches, behind-the-scenes). Algorithm Priorities: Engagement rate (likes + comments + saves + shares / reach, saves weighted highest signal of value), watch time for Reels (completion rate >50% ideal, loop videos to boost), original content (not reposted from TikTok watermark penalty). Optimal Posting: Tuesday-Friday 10am-3pm, avoid Monday mornings and late nights, 3-5 posts/week minimum for feed, daily Stories for top-of-mind, 3-5 Reels/week for discovery. Caption Strategy: Hook in first 125 characters (before "more" cutoff), line breaks for readability (use . or • on separate line to force break), 3-5 hashtags in caption or first comment (micro hashtags 10K-500K posts perform better than mega 1M+), tag collaborators/location for reach boost, emoji for visual breaks not overuse. Content Pillars: 60% educational (how-tos, tips, industry insights), 30% entertaining (memes, behind-scenes, relatable content), 10% promotional (product launches, sales, CTAs), Stories can be 80% behind-scenes/casual.

TikTok—Content Formula: Hook (0-3 seconds must stop scroll, bold text overlay, surprising visual, question/problem), value delivery (3-30 seconds core content, fast pacing 2-3 second clips, text overlays key points), CTA (last 3-5 seconds like/follow/comment question), loop back to start (encourage rewatches). Trending Audio: Use TikTok-native trending sounds (not Instagram reposted, check "Top 50" in sounds library), add audio within 24-48 hours of trending (window closes fast), original audio can go viral if unique hook, music 70% volume voice 100% for balance. Algorithm Mechanics: For You Page (FYP) driven by watch time (completion rate king, aim 50%+ average), engagement velocity (likes/comments/shares in first hour critical), video information (captions, sounds, hashtags train algorithm), user interactions (watch history, liked content, followed accounts). Optimal Strategy: Post 1-3x daily (more frequency = more chances at viral), first 1-3 hours determine video fate (engage with comments, respond to boost), batch create 7-10 videos when inspired (trends move fast), duets/stitches leverage other creators' audiences. Caption Best Practices: First line hook question or bold statement (shows before "see more"), 3-5 hashtags (1-2 niche like #BookTok #CleanTok, 1 broad like #FYP, 1 trending challenge), encourage comments ("tell me in the comments"), text overlays reduce need for long caption. Avoid: Reposted content from Instagram/YouTube (watermarks penalized), asking for likes/follows directly (violates spam policy), overly salesy (educational-first wins).

LinkedIn—Professional Content: Text posts (1300 character sweet spot, longer posts collapsed reduce readability, line breaks for scanability, personal stories > corporate speak), carousels (PDF upload 10-15 slides, swipe-through format, professional design Canva templates, educational frameworks/how-tos), videos (native upload not YouTube links, 1-3 minutes, captions mandatory 85% watch muted, talking head + B-roll), articles (long-form 1000+ words, thought leadership, SEO-optimized, linked from profile), polls (4 options max, professional topics, drives engagement, comments weighted high). Algorithm Priorities: Dwell time (how long users stay on post, longer = broader distribution), engagement velocity (first 60 minutes critical, seed with team engagement), connection engagement (comments from connections weighted higher), professional relevance (LinkedIn scores content for professionalism, memes don't perform). Optimal Posting: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am, 12pm, 5-6pm (workday scrolling), avoid weekends (50% less engagement), 3-5x weekly for individuals, daily for company pages. Voice/Tone: Professional but human (ditch corporate jargon, personal stories resonate), vulnerable storytelling (challenges/failures/lessons get 3x engagement vs wins-only), contrarian takes (respectful hot takes spark conversation), actionable insights (frameworks/templates/how-tos get saved/shared). Hashtags: 3-5 professional hashtags (mix of niche #ProductManagement #B2BSaaS and broad #Leadership), first comment vs caption (test both, no consensus), branded hashtag for campaigns. Engagement Strategy: Comment on others' posts first (LinkedIn rewards active members, 10 comments before posting primes algorithm), respond to every comment first hour (boosts velocity signal), tag relevant people in posts (mention thought leaders, collaborators, clients with permission), reshare others' content (visibility to your network, builds relationships).

Twitter/X—Thread Strategy: Hook tweet (must perform standalone, ends with "🧵" or "Thread:" to indicate more), 5-15 tweets optimal (longer loses readers, shorter lacks depth), one idea per tweet (scannable, retweetable individually), visual break every 3-4 tweets (image, GIF, video, quote card), CTA in last tweet (follow, check DMs, link to newsletter/product), numbered tweets optional (1/12 format vs unnumbered test both). Tweet Best Practices: First 280 characters hook (no "read more" cutoff on timeline), line breaks for readability (hit return twice, use bullet points •), questions drive replies (algorithm loves engagement), hot takes spark conversation (respectful disagreement acceptable), no hashtags in tweet body (looks spammy, use 1-2 in replies if needed), tag people @ for attention (credit sources, mention collaborators, tag larger accounts for reach). Algorithm Mechanics: Engagement rate (replies > retweets > likes weighted), recency (tweets decay fast, 18-minute half-life, post frequently), author authority (blue check, follower count, engagement history matters), media attachments (images/videos boost engagement 35% but can reduce retweets, test with/without). Optimal Posting: Weekdays 9am-3pm peak (mornings for US East, afternoons for West), evenings 6-9pm secondary peak (entertainment browsing), 3-10 tweets daily acceptable (more = more chances, but quality > quantity), threads 2-3x weekly for depth. Content Mix: 60% value (insights, tips, frameworks, original thoughts), 30% engagement (questions, polls, replies to others, community building), 10% promotional (product mentions, CTAs, links), retweet sparingly (your own content with commentary fine, others' content 20% max). Avoid: Clickbait headlines without substance (algorithm downranks), excessive hashtags (looks spammy, 1-2 max), begging for engagement ("please RT" violates spam), cross-posting identical content from other platforms (write native tweets).

**CONTENT CREATION FRAMEWORK**

Hook Formula—First 3 Seconds/5 Words: Pattern interrupt (surprising stat, contrarian take, bold claim), curiosity gap (unanswered question, incomplete story), relatability ("You know that feeling when...", pain point acknowledgment), visual surprise (unexpected visual, quick cut, dynamic movement), emotional trigger (FOMO, desire, frustration, inspiration). Examples: "I wasted $10K before learning this" (curiosity + relatability), "Everyone tells you X. They're wrong." (contrarian), "This 30-second habit changed my life" (curiosity + benefit), "POV: You just discovered..." (immersive + intrigue). Testing: 80% of success determined by hook, A/B test 3-5 hooks per concept, analyze first 3-second retention in analytics, iterate winning patterns.

Value Delivery—Middle Content: Educational (how-to steps, frameworks, tips), entertaining (humor, storytelling, relatability, surprise), inspirational (transformation stories, behind-scenes journey, vulnerability), informational (news, trends, data, insights). Structure: Problem → Solution (identify pain, offer fix), Before → After (transformation, results, testimonial), Listicle (3-7 items, odd numbers perform better, scannable), Story Arc (challenge, struggle, resolution, lesson). Pacing: Fast cuts 2-3 seconds per clip (TikTok/Reels), longer holds 5-10 seconds if visually interesting (Instagram feed), text overlays for key points (80% watch muted), visual variety (mix of shots, graphics, b-roll) maintains attention.

CTA Strategy—Call-to-Action: Low friction (like, comment, save, share, "thoughts?"), medium friction (follow, tag a friend, answer question in comments), high friction (click link, sign up, purchase, "DM me WORD for X"). Timing: Instagram/TikTok (CTA at end after value delivered, "Save this for later"), LinkedIn (CTA mid-post or end, "What's your experience? Comment below"), Twitter (CTA in thread last tweet, "Follow for more on [topic]"). Phrasing: Specific action ("Save this to try later" > "Let me know what you think"), benefit-driven ("Follow for daily marketing tips" > "Follow me"), urgency when appropriate ("Link in bio for 48 hours" for launches).

Visual Design—Photography: High-quality iPhone photos acceptable (natural lighting, rule of thirds, clear subject), lifestyle over stock (authentic > polished, behind-scenes > staged), faces perform better (human connection, eyes toward CTA if present), consistent filters/presets (brand cohesion, recognizable aesthetic). Video: Vertical 9:16 for Reels/TikTok/Stories (full-screen mobile), square 1:1 for Instagram feed (versatile), horizontal 16:9 for LinkedIn/YouTube, captions always (accessibility + sound-off viewing), dynamic not static (movement, cuts, zooms maintain attention), text overlays (key points, captions, CTAs) white with black outline for readability. Graphics: On-brand colors (2-3 color palette consistent), readable fonts (sans-serif, 60pt+ mobile legible), white space (not cluttered, one idea per frame), templates for efficiency (Canva Brand Kit, batch create), memes/trends (jump on quickly but brand-appropriate).

Hashtag Strategy—Research: Hashtag size analysis (10K-500K "micro" hashtags highest engagement rate, 500K-1M "medium" discoverable, 1M+ "mega" low chance of visibility), competitor research (what hashtags do similar accounts use successfully), platform tools (Instagram Explore search, TikTok Discover trending), audience hashtags (what does target audience follow/search). Selection: 1 branded hashtag (own campaign/product, #YourBrandName), 2-3 niche hashtags (industry-specific, target audience uses, #B2BMarketing #ContentStrategy), 1 trending/broad hashtag (zeitgeist connection, #MarketingTips), rotate per post (avoid spam penalty, fresh reach each post). Placement: Instagram (caption or first comment test both, 3-5 hashtags optimal vs old 30-hashtag strategy), TikTok (caption 3-5 hashtags, trending sounds more important), LinkedIn (3-5 professional hashtags in caption), Twitter (avoid in main tweet, 1-2 in replies if necessary). Tracking: Branded hashtag UGC (monitor for user content, reshare with credit), hashtag performance (Insights shows reach per hashtag, double down on winners), trending hijacking (jump on trends quickly but relevant, not forced).

**CONTENT PLANNING**

Content Calendar—Cadence: Instagram (3-5 feed posts/week, daily Stories, 3-5 Reels/week for growth), TikTok (1-3 videos/day for algorithm favor, minimum 3-5/week), LinkedIn (3-5 posts/week for individuals, daily for companies), Twitter (3-10 tweets/day, 2-3 threads/week). Content Pillars: 4-5 themes (education, inspiration, entertainment, community, product), 60/30/10 rule (60% educational, 30% engaging/entertaining, 10% promotional), theme days (Monday motivation, Wednesday tips, Friday behind-scenes), seasonal content (holidays, industry events, cultural moments). Batching: Block 4-8 hours for creation (batch shoot 10-20 photos, record 7-10 videos one session), batch write captions (30-minute sprint for week's captions), batch schedule (use Later, Buffer, Hootsuite for week ahead, maintain 20% flexibility for real-time). Planning Tools: Notion/Airtable content database (ideas, status, publish dates, performance), Trello kanban (ideas → script → shoot → edit → schedule), spreadsheet simple (date, platform, topic, status, link, metrics).

Analytics Review—Key Metrics: Reach (unique accounts, measures discovery vs followers), Engagement Rate (likes + comments + saves + shares / reach, >3% good, >5% excellent), Saves (highest value signal, content worth revisiting), Shares (virality indicator, exponential reach), Profile Visits (brand awareness, traffic to bio link), Follower Growth (net new, >1% monthly sustainable). Content Performance: Best performers (what topics, formats, hooks worked, double down), worst performers (what flopped, why, avoid or iterate), posting time analysis (when does audience engage, adjust schedule), hashtag performance (which hashtags drove reach, rotate winners). Audience Insights: Demographics (age, gender, location align with target), active times (when followers online, schedule posts accordingly), interests (what content they engage with beyond yours, content inspiration), competitor benchmarking (compare engagement rates, follower growth, learn from successful).

Testing & Iteration—A/B Testing: Hook variations (test 3-5 different first lines/frames, measure retention), format experiments (carousel vs single image vs Reel, video vs image), caption length (short punchy vs long storytelling), CTA differences (question vs action vs no CTA), hashtag sets (niche vs broad vs trending mixes). Hypothesis-Driven: "If we post Reels at 7pm instead of 12pm, engagement will increase 20%" (test 2 weeks, measure), "If we add polls to Stories daily, profile visits will increase 30%" (test 1 month, compare to baseline), "If we use micro hashtags vs mega, reach will improve 50%" (split test across posts). Learning Velocity: Weekly analytics review (quick check on week's performance, spot trends), monthly deep dive (full metrics analysis, strategy adjustments, content pivot decisions), quarterly strategy overhaul (assess what's working, kill what's not, double down on winners, try new platforms/formats).

**ENGAGEMENT & COMMUNITY**

Response Strategy—Timing: Golden hour (first 60 minutes after posting critical for algorithm, respond to all comments), within 2 hours ideal (shows active community management, boosts engagement signals), same-day minimum (respecting followers' time, maintaining conversation momentum). Response Types: Value-add (answer questions thoroughly, provide additional tips/resources), relationship-building (ask follow-up questions, show genuine interest, use commenter's name), gratitude (thank for shares/saves, acknowledge thoughtful comments), conflict resolution (address concerns professionally, take heated discussions to DMs). Automation Boundaries: Don't auto-respond (generic replies obvious, reduces authenticity), use templates sparingly (common questions can have base response personalized with commenter's context), moderate with care (remove spam/hate, enforce community guidelines, explain removals when appropriate).

User-Generated Content (UGC)—Campaign Design: Branded hashtag (unique, memorable, incentivized with reshares/features), contest/giveaway (entry via UGC post, tag brand, follow account, prize relevant to brand), challenge (creative prompt, trend participation, examples provided), testimonial requests (share your story, customer spotlights, before/after transformations). Permissions: Explicit permission (ask before reposting, "Can we share this?"), credit always (tag original creator, maintain their caption or add attribution), legal compliance (contest rules, privacy policies, rights to use content), compensation consideration (pay for high-value UGC, free product, commission, exposure for micro-influencers). Amplification: Reshare to feed/Stories (spotlight community, build loyalty, encourage more UGC), create UGC highlight reel (compilation video of customer content, social proof), website/email integration (feature UGC in marketing beyond social, omnichannel presence).

Influencer Collaboration—Tier Selection: Mega (1M+ followers, brand awareness, expensive $10K-$100K+, low engagement rate 1-3%), Macro (100K-1M followers, reach + credibility, $1K-$10K, moderate engagement 3-5%), Micro (10K-100K followers, niche authority, $100-$1K, high engagement 5-10%), Nano (<10K followers, authentic community, free product or $50-$200, highest engagement 10%+). Partnership Types: Sponsored post (one-time content, fee + product, clear deliverables), brand ambassador (ongoing relationship, monthly content, exclusive partnership), affiliate (commission-based, trackable links, performance-driven), gifting (free product, no guaranteed post, authentic endorsement if they love it), content collaboration (co-create content, both accounts benefit, cross-promotion). Brief Essentials: Campaign objective (brand awareness, product launch, sales conversion), content guidelines (key messages, hashtags, @tags, disclosure requirements), creative freedom (give examples not scripts, authenticity > control), timeline (review process, posting dates, reshare permissions), compensation (fee, product value, affiliate terms, payment schedule). Measurement: Engagement rate (likes + comments / followers, benchmark against influencer's average), reach (impressions, stories views), conversions (affiliate clicks, promo code usage, trackable link traffic), sentiment (comment tone, brand association), ROI (revenue vs investment, long-term brand lift).

I'll help in the replies.", "Poll: Do you use roadmaps? Yes/No/It's complicated/What's a roadmap", retweets of community posts with commentary). Tweet Formulas—Insight + Proof (share lesson + data/story, "We 10x'd our signup conversion. The change? We removed 3 fields from the form. Sometimes less is literally more."), Contrarian Take + Rationale (disagree with common wisdom, "Hot take: Your customers don't want more features. They want the features you have to actually work."), Listicle Thread (5-10 quick tips, "10 things I learned building a SaaS to $1M ARR: 1. Your first idea is probably wrong 2. Charge more than you think 3. [etc]"), Story Arc (beginning/middle/end, "Thread: How we went from idea to $10K MRR in 6 months 🧵"), Question + Engagement ("Product managers: What's the hardest part of your job?

Hope this helps. Follow me for weekly product insights."), Thursday Thread (Startup Journey, 6-10 tweets, vulnerable storytelling, "The worst day of my founder journey. What I learned. 🧵" personal story arc, challenge → low point → lesson → transformation, inspires engagement "been there" replies). Daily Tweet Cadence—7am Tweet (Insight from yesterday's work, "Shipped a feature yesterday that 0 people asked for. Guess what? It's our most-used feature today. Listen to customers but don't outsource your product vision."), 10am Reply Thread (engage with 10 product management posts, thoughtful replies not generic, build relationships with other founders/PMs/VCs, algorithm rewards active members), 12pm Thread or Mega-Tweet (Monday/Thursday threads, otherwise long-form tweet 280 chars, screenshot of Notion doc or thread rolled into single tweet via Typefully), 3pm Community Engagement (poll, question, or reply to mentions/comments from morning, "Thanks for all the replies on this morning's tweet. Loved hearing your perspectives on [topic]."), 6pm Casual/Personal Tweet (behind-scenes, non-product, humanizes founder, "Just closed my laptop after a 10-hour day. Startup life is wild. Also my kid just asked why I work on the computer all day. Still working on a good answer."). Growth Strategy—Engagement Before Posting (spend 30 min engaging on others' posts BEFORE tweeting own content, reply to 10-20 tweets from target audience product managers/founders/VCs, algorithm rewards active members with better distribution of own tweets), Tag Strategically (tag 1-2 relevant accounts in threads when appropriate, credit sources, mention people whose ideas inspired tweet, don't overdo or looks like attention grab), Viral Mechanics (write 50 tweets to get 5 good ones to get 1 viral, viral tweets grow followers 100-500+, double down on topic when tweet takes off reply to top comments, quote tweet own thread with additional thoughts extends viral window), Cross-Promotion (add Twitter to email signature, LinkedIn bio, newsletter, convert LinkedIn posts to Twitter threads different format same content). Metrics—Follower Growth (Week 1-4: +120 followers from 2,000 to 2,120 slow start, Month 2: +380 followers consistent tweeting establishing presence, Month 3: +940 followers first viral thread hit 100K impressions, Month 4-6: +1,200/month momentum compounding engagement up + several micro-viral posts, End Month 6: 9,260 followers short of 20K goal but 5x growth), Engagement Rate (avg 2.8% engagement rate early on, grew to 4.2% by month 3 as ratio improved followers engaged vs passive, threads 8-12% engagement rate significantly higher format for depth), Profile Visits (grew from 50/week to 800/week, CTA in threads working "Follow for weekly product insights", bio optimized "Building [Product]. Sharing lessons from $0 to $1M MRR. PM tips weekly."), Link Clicks (newsletter signup link in bio, 8% of profile visitors click, 12% of clickers convert to subscribers, Twitter now #2 newsletter source after LinkedIn). Iteration—Thread format winning (2x weekly → 3x weekly more threads less standalone tweets), vulnerable storytelling outperforms tactical how-tos (tactical gets saves, vulnerable gets replies/shares adjust mix), reply game matters more than thought (30 min daily engagement critical, skip day and next tweet flops), use Typefully for thread writing (draft/schedule/analytics better than native Twitter, analyze best-performing tweets double down on topics/formats).
