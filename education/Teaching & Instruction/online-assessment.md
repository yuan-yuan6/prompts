```

### RUBRIC DEVELOPMENT

### Analytic Rubric Design
```
Assignment: [ASSIGNMENT_NAME]
Total Points: [TOTAL_POINTS]

| Criterion | Excellent (A) | Proficient (B) | Developing (C) | Beginning (D/F) | Points |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| [CRITERION_1] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | /[POINTS] |
| [CRITERION_2] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | /[POINTS] |
| [CRITERION_3] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | [DESCRIPTION] | /[POINTS] |

Rubric Features:
- Specific observable behaviors
- Clear performance levels
- Aligned to learning objectives
- Shared with students before assignment
- Used for self-assessment
```

### AUTOMATED GRADING

### Auto-Grading Configuration
```
Question Bank Setup:
- Total questions in bank: [NUMBER]
- Questions per quiz: [NUMBER]
- Randomization: Yes/No
- Question difficulty distribution:
  * Easy: [PERCENTAGE]%
  * Medium: [PERCENTAGE]%
  * Hard: [PERCENTAGE]%

Grading Rules:
- Partial credit: [ENABLED/DISABLED]
- Negative marking: [ENABLED/DISABLED]
- Penalty per attempt: [PERCENTAGE]%
- Time bonus: [BONUS_STRUCTURE]

Feedback Settings:
- Show correct answers: [WHEN]
- Show explanations: [WHEN]
- Show score: Immediately/After due date
- Allow review: Yes/No
```

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

### Integrity Measures
```
