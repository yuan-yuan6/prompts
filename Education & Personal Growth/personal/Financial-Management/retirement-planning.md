# Retirement Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan for retirement across six dimensions: goal clarity, savings/cashflow, account strategy, risk/investments, assumptions/estimates, and review discipline.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **retirement planning readiness** for **{PROFILE}** with goals **{RETIREMENT_GOALS}** and constraints **{CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension **1–5**, justify, and produce a roadmap with next actions, a contribution strategy, and success metrics.

---

## Template

Conduct a retirement planning readiness assessment for {PROFILE} with goals {RETIREMENT_GOALS} and constraints {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) RETIREMENT GOAL CLARITY**
- Target retirement age range and lifestyle assumptions
- Priorities and tradeoffs (spend now vs later)
- Non-financial factors considered (health, location, family)

**2) SAVINGS & CASHFLOW**
- Current savings rate and ability to sustain it
- Emergency buffer supports long-term investing
- Debt and major near-term goals accounted for

**3) ACCOUNT & CONTRIBUTION STRATEGY**
- Uses available workplace plans (match awareness)
- Contribution prioritization is clear (order of operations)
- Beneficiaries and basic admin are handled

**4) INVESTMENT APPROACH & RISK**
- Diversification and risk level aligned to horizon
- Rebalancing plan exists
- Avoids panic-driven changes

**5) ESTIMATES & ASSUMPTIONS**
- Rough projection exists (even if imperfect)
- Inflation, healthcare, and longevity considered at a high level
- “What could go wrong” scenarios acknowledged

**6) REVIEW & ADAPTATION**
- Annual review habit (or quarterly check-in)
- Adjusts contributions with income changes
- Life-change triggers defined (job change, marriage, kids, move)

---

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 90 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **RETIREMENT SYSTEM DESIGN**
- Contribution cadence, escalation plan, and review cadence
- High-level account prioritization approach

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency

5) **12-MONTH ROADMAP**
- Setup (months 1–3) and execution (months 4–12)

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs targets: contribution %, emergency buffer, plan coverage, review completion

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (no consistent plan)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some saving, major gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (consistent saving/investing, basic plan)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (strategic contributions, regular reviews)
- 5.0: Optimized (robust plan, resilient to life changes)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {PROFILE} | Age, income stability, accounts | “35, stable job, 401(k) match available” |
| {RETIREMENT_GOALS} | Retirement target + lifestyle | “Retire 60–65; comfortable lifestyle; travel yearly” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “Student loan payments; can increase savings slowly” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {PROFILE}: 35, stable income, 401(k) available with match, no written plan
- {RETIREMENT_GOALS}: Retire 60–65 with stable lifestyle and some travel
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Paying down student loans; can increase contributions gradually

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.1/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) capture match and automate contributions, (2) set a contribution escalation, (3) schedule an annual review

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Goal Clarity | 3.5 | Age range and lifestyle roughly defined | Add rough spending target |
| Savings & Cashflow | 3.0 | Can save monthly | Clarify buffer and debt tradeoffs |
| Account Strategy | 3.0 | Has 401(k) | Confirm match capture and beneficiaries |
| Investments & Risk | 3.0 | Wants simple approach | Define risk level and rebalancing cadence |
| Assumptions | 2.5 | No projection | Create a rough estimate and update yearly |
| Review & Adaptation | 3.5 | Will schedule review | Set triggers and reminders |

3) **RETIREMENT SYSTEM DESIGN**
- Contributions: start at X% now, increase every 3–6 months
- Review cadence: quarterly quick check + annual deep review

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: No escalation plan → stagnation → scheduled increases
- Gap 2: No projection → uncertainty → create rough estimate
- Gap 3: Admin gaps → beneficiaries forgotten → set and verify
- Gap 4: Reactive investing → anxiety → commit to schedule-based review
- Gap 5: Debt vs saving tradeoffs unclear → conflict → define priority rules

5) **12-MONTH ROADMAP**
- Months 1–3: capture match; set escalation; build a one-page plan; set reminders
- Months 4–12: run system; review quarterly; adjust contributions when income changes

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Contribution consistency: 100% monthly
- Contribution rate: increase by 1–2 points over 12 months
- Review completion: 0 → 1 annual review
- Emergency buffer: grow toward 3–6 months over time

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Automate contributions** — removes decision fatigue.
2) **Capture any match** — it’s a high-impact lever.
3) **Increase gradually** — escalation beats one-time willpower.
4) **Keep assumptions explicit** — update annually.
5) **Separate buffers from investing** — resilience prevents panic.
6) **Use a simple, diversified approach** — reduce mistakes.
7) **Schedule reviews** — don’t “wing it.”
8) **Update when life changes** — job, family, housing, health.
