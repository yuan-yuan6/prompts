# Online Learning Platforms Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive online learning platforms including e-learning design, MOOCs, webinars, virtual classrooms, and digital education systems for diverse educational contexts and learner needs.

## Quick Start

**Need to set up online learning quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Design a 4-week online course for adult learners on digital marketing basics. Platform: Canvas LMS. Include: weekly video lectures (10-15 min), interactive quizzes, discussion forums, one live Q&A session per week, and a final project. Provide downloadable resources and mobile access. Class size: 30 students. Asynchronous with synchronous touchpoints.
```

### When to Use This
- Creating online or blended learning courses
- Designing virtual classroom experiences
- Building e-learning modules or MOOCs
- Developing digital training programs

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Choose platform and format** - Select LMS and delivery model (sync/async/hybrid)
2. **Design learning experience** - Create content, activities, and assessments
3. **Build engagement strategy** - Add interaction, support, and community elements

**Time to complete**: 3-5 days for simple course, 2-4 weeks for comprehensive platform
