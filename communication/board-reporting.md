# Board Reporting & Governance Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for creating board-level reports, managing governance processes, and ensuring effective communication with boards of directors and governance committees.

## Quick Start

**Need to prepare board materials quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Board meeting: Quarterly business review
Audience: 11 independent directors
Key topics: Q3 financial results, strategic initiative updates, risk assessment
Decision needed: Approve Q4 budget revision and major investment
Materials: Executive summary, financial dashboard, strategic roadmap, risk heat map
```

### When to Use This
- Preparing quarterly or annual board meeting packages
- Creating executive summaries for critical board decisions
- Developing board-level dashboards and performance reports
- Managing governance communications and compliance reporting

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Structure Content** - Create executive summary with key insights, decisions needed, and supporting data
2. **Visualize Performance** - Design dashboards showing financial metrics, strategic progress, and risk indicators
3. **Package and Distribute** - Assemble board package with proper formatting, distribute in advance, and prepare for Q&A

**Time to complete**: 3-4 hours for routine quarterly update, 1-2 days for comprehensive annual board package
