## Template

Develop a comprehensive 3-year AI strategy roadmap for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization with {CONTEXT}.

Create a strategic AI transformation plan covering:

**1. STRATEGIC CONTEXT**
- Business strategy alignment and AI opportunity mapping
- Competitive landscape and industry AI adoption analysis
- Current AI maturity and capability gaps
- Technology landscape assessment (LLMs, Computer Vision, Predictive Analytics, AI Agents)

**2. AI VISION & OBJECTIVES**
- Vision statement: "[Organization] will [transformation outcome] through AI-powered [capabilities]"
- 3-5 strategic objectives with success metrics and timelines
- Value drivers: efficiency gains, revenue growth, innovation opportunities
- Target state definition for Years 1, 2, and 3

**3. STRATEGIC PILLARS**
- 3-4 strategic pillars (e.g., Customer Intelligence, Operational Excellence, Product Innovation)
- For each pillar: key initiatives, expected value, success metrics, dependencies

**4. CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS**
- Data foundation (platform, quality, governance, feature store)
- Technology infrastructure (ML platform, compute, MLOps, APIs)
- Talent & organization (hiring plan, upskilling, operating model: COE vs federated vs hub-and-spoke)
- Governance & risk (ethics framework, model governance, regulatory compliance)

**5. PHASED ROADMAP**
- Horizon 1 (Year 1): Foundation—data platform, governance, 2-3 pilots, initial talent
- Horizon 2 (Year 2): Scale—production deployment, portfolio expansion, MLOps maturity
- Horizon 3 (Year 3+): Transform—enterprise-wide adoption, advanced AI, business model innovation
- Quarterly milestone breakdown with owners and success criteria

**6. INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK**
- Budget by category: Platform, Talent, Partners, Use Cases, Governance
- Year-over-year investment allocation
- Value realization projections: cost savings, revenue impact, risk avoidance
- ROI analysis and payback period

**7. GOVERNANCE & EXECUTION**
- Governance structure: Steering Committee, AI Program Office, Pillar Teams
- Decision rights and escalation paths
- Success metrics dashboard: value, adoption, capability, speed, risk
- Review cadence and portfolio management

**8. RISK MANAGEMENT**
- Strategic risks: talent, technology changes, regulation, ROI, competition
- Execution risks: data quality, integration, change resistance, vendor dependency
- Mitigation strategies for each identified risk

Deliver your strategy as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Vision, key numbers (investment, value, timeline), 3 strategic pillars, top priorities

2. **STRATEGIC CONTEXT** - Business alignment matrix, competitive position, maturity assessment

3. **ROADMAP VISUALIZATION** - Three horizons with quarterly activities across pillars and enablers

4. **INVESTMENT & VALUE** - Budget summary, value realization timeline, ROI projection

5. **GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK** - Structure diagram, decision rights, success metrics

6. **RISK REGISTER** - Top 10 risks with likelihood, impact, and mitigation

7. **90-DAY QUICK START** - Immediate priorities to launch the transformation

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Technology-First Strategy** - Focusing on AI capabilities without clear business value
✅ Instead: Start with business problems and work backward to AI solutions

❌ **Underestimating Change** - Treating AI as a technology project, not a transformation
✅ Instead: Include change management, training, and culture in the roadmap

❌ **Pilot Purgatory** - Successful pilots that never scale to production
✅ Instead: Plan for scaling from day one; include production criteria in pilot design

❌ **Ignoring Data Debt** - Assuming data is ready for AI
✅ Instead: Conduct data assessment early; include data remediation in roadmap

❌ **Going It Alone** - Trying to build everything internally
✅ Instead: Strategic use of partners and vendors to accelerate and fill gaps
