# Brand Storytelling Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to create a coherent brand story system—narrative, voice, and reusable story assets—that teams can deploy consistently across channels.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess brand storytelling readiness for [BRAND_NAME] targeting [TARGET_AUDIENCE] with objective [STORYTELLING_OBJECTIVE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Purpose & differentiation, (2) Audience, community & culture, (3) Narrative architecture & story assets, (4) Voice, tone & identity system, (5) Governance & internal enablement, (6) Measurement & evolution. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, and a 60-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Purpose & Differentiation
- 1 — Initial: Purpose and positioning are unclear; stories are generic; differentiation is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Purpose, values, and positioning are documented; story themes align to strategy.
- 5 — Optimized: Storytelling reinforces strategic differentiation; themes are durable and actively maintained.

### 2) Audience, Community & Culture
- 1 — Initial: Limited audience insight; cultural context is not considered; assumptions drive stories.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and communities are identified; audience tensions and motivations are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Insights are continuously refreshed; cultural nuance is handled intentionally; community feedback loops inform stories.

### 3) Narrative Architecture & Story Assets
- 1 — Initial: No narrative framework; assets are one-off; stories aren’t reusable across touchpoints.
- 3 — Defined: Narrative framework exists (origin, values, proof, customer transformation); asset library is organized.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular story system supports multiple formats; proof is integrated; assets are versioned and easy to reuse.

### 4) Voice, Tone & Identity System
- 1 — Initial: Voice is inconsistent; teams improvise; tone varies widely by channel.
- 3 — Defined: Voice and tone guidelines exist; examples show how to adapt by context.
- 5 — Optimized: Voice system is trained, audited, and enforced with lightweight governance; adaptations preserve identity.

### 5) Governance & Internal Enablement
- 1 — Initial: No ownership; approvals are subjective; rollout and training are missing.
- 3 — Defined: Ownership and decision rights; content review process; enablement materials exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Clear governance and intake; teams are enabled to self-serve; reviews focus on principles and evidence.

### 6) Measurement & Evolution
- 1 — Initial: No measurement; stories are not tested; iteration is sporadic.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs and qualitative signals; testing plan; learnings captured.
- 5 — Optimized: Story performance is measured across funnel; feedback loops drive updates; narrative stays current without thrash.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with evidence and top gaps
- Narrative framework (purpose, themes, story arcs, proof points)
- Voice and tone guide with examples by channel
- Story asset library outline (formats, owners, versioning)
- 60-day rollout plan (training, governance, measurement)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE]: Primary audience/community
- [STORYTELLING_OBJECTIVE]: Trust, awareness, differentiation, adoption, loyalty
- [CORE_PURPOSE]: The brand’s purpose/why
- [PROOF_POINTS]: Evidence (customer outcomes, heritage, expertise, credentials)
- [TOUCHPOINTS]: Website, social, email, sales, product, PR, events

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: EcoLife Products
- Objective: Increase trust and loyalty through an origin + customer transformation narrative
- Scores (1–5): Purpose 3; Audience 2; Assets 2; Voice 3; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: No reusable story library; weak community insight; inconsistent approvals
- 60-day priorities: Build narrative framework + proof points; create voice guide; establish governance and a simple measurement loop
