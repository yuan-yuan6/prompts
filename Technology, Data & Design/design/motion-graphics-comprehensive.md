## Template

Design motion graphics strategy for {PROJECT_TYPE} serving {AUDIENCE} with {DURATION} across {DISTRIBUTION_CHANNELS}.

**CREATIVE CONCEPT AND STORYTELLING STRATEGY**

Establish narrative structure matching content purpose and audience engagement patterns. Explainer videos follow problem-solution-action arc: establish pain point (15-20 seconds), demonstrate solution benefits (40-50 seconds), conclude with clear call-to-action (10-15 seconds). Brand story animations emphasize emotional journey over feature lists using visual metaphors translating abstract values into tangible imagery. Logo reveals focus on memorable 3-5 second sequences balancing sophistication with clarity.

Develop visual storytelling language appropriate to message complexity and viewer sophistication. Technical B2B content uses clean geometric animations emphasizing precision and reliability through grid-based compositions and measured timing. Consumer lifestyle content employs organic flowing movements with warm color transitions creating aspiration and connection. Educational content balances information density with comprehension pacing using progressive disclosure revealing complexity incrementally.

Design emotional arc guiding viewer response through animation progression. Opening captures attention through unexpected movement or bold visual establishing intrigue. Middle builds engagement through rhythm variation maintaining interest while delivering core message. Conclusion provides resolution and satisfaction through visual payoff reinforcing key takeaway. Consider platform context: social media demands immediate hook (first 3 seconds critical), website allows gradual build, presentation format permits extended development.

Establish brand integration depth balancing recognition with creative expression. Light integration incorporates brand colors in accent elements and logo placement at conclusion maintaining creative flexibility. Moderate integration weaves brand typography, patterns, and visual language throughout animation creating consistent identity without dominating narrative. Deep integration designs entire motion system around brand personality making animation inseparable from brand expression suitable for signature content or style guide demonstrations.

**ANIMATION PRINCIPLES AND MOTION PERSONALITY**

Apply classical animation principles adapted for motion graphics context. Ease-in and ease-out (slow-in-slow-out) creates natural movement acceleration avoiding robotic linear motion. Professional animations typically use cubic-bezier curves with 60-80% ease providing organic feel. Anticipation builds believability preparing viewer for major actions through subtle counter-movements before primary motion. Follow-through adds realism showing momentum continuation and secondary elements trailing primary action.

Define motion personality reflecting brand character and content tone. Fluid personality uses smooth continuous curves, gentle accelerations, and flowing transitions suitable for wellness, creativity, or premium brands. Mechanical personality employs precise movements, grid-snapping, and right-angle paths communicating efficiency and technical expertise for B2B or tech products. Organic personality features asymmetric motion, natural easing, and imperfect timing creating approachability for lifestyle or community-focused content.

Establish timing philosophy balancing visibility with engagement. Conservative timing holds key frames 0.5-1 second ensuring comprehension for complex information or older demographics. Dynamic timing moves quickly (0.2-0.4 second holds) maintaining energy for younger audiences or entertainment content. Vary pacing within animation: slower for critical information requiring processing, faster for transitions or supporting elements. Synchronize motion to audio beats when present creating unified rhythmic experience.

Design transition vocabulary creating visual continuity across scenes. Morphing transitions transform one shape into another through intermediate states suitable for conceptual connections or category changes. Wipe transitions use animated masks revealing next scene with directional movement implying progression or relationship. Particle dissolves scatter elements creating energy and dynamism appropriate for technology or innovation themes. Maintain transition consistency using 2-3 signature techniques throughout piece avoiding random variety undermining coherence.

**KINETIC TYPOGRAPHY AND TEXT ANIMATION**

Prioritize readability ensuring text remains legible throughout motion. Minimum text duration equals read-time plus 30-40% buffer: 8-10 words require 3-4 seconds on-screen accounting for movement. Use sans-serif typefaces (Helvetica, Roboto, Gotham) for screen clarity avoiding delicate serifs lost in motion blur. Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum between text and background meeting WCAG AA standards. Size text appropriately: minimum 60px for full HD (1920x1080), 120px for social media vertical (1080x1920) accounting for mobile viewing.

Design text entrance and exit matching message hierarchy and rhythm. Stagger character-by-character animation for emphasis revealing individual letters with 0.05-0.1 second delay between characters. Slide complete phrases for supporting information entering from consistent direction (typically left or bottom) maintaining spatial logic. Fade longer blocks of text avoiding movement distraction when reading extended copy. Scale key words or numbers 120-150% momentarily when introduced emphasizing critical data points.

Implement kinetic text techniques reinforcing message emotion and meaning. Use bounce or elastic easing for playful or energetic content creating personality through exaggerated motion curves. Apply subtle rotation (2-5 degrees) on emphasis words drawing eye while avoiding seasickness from excessive movement. Integrate text with visual elements: text follows curved paths around objects, scales in response to visual events, or morphs into supporting graphics blurring boundary between typography and illustration.

Adapt typography approach for multi-language requirements accounting for text expansion and cultural reading patterns. Romance languages (Spanish, French) expand 20-30% over English requiring flexible layouts accommodating variable width. Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew) necessitate mirrored animation directions and right-aligned entrances. Vertical languages (traditional Chinese, Japanese) require portrait-oriented compositions. Budget 40-60% additional animation time for multi-language versions accounting for retiming and layout adjustments.

**PRODUCTION WORKFLOW AND TIMELINE PLANNING**

Phase pre-production establishing creative foundation and technical specifications (typically 20-30% of timeline). Develop creative brief capturing objectives, audience, message, and success metrics in 1-2 page document. Create mood boards collecting 8-12 visual references establishing aesthetic direction. Storyboard key moments using 6-12 frames illustrating major beats ensuring narrative clarity before asset creation. Produce animatic (rough animated storyboard with temp audio) validating timing and pacing preventing expensive revisions during production.

Execute asset creation preparing all visual and audio elements (25-35% of timeline). Design character or icon library establishing visual consistency across elements. Create modular components enabling reuse and efficiency: build 5-7 foundational shapes or elements recombined throughout animation rather than unique assets per scene. Establish color palette with 3-5 primary colors plus neutrals maintaining visual cohesion. Select or commission audio early as music rhythm often drives animation timing achieving tight audio-visual synchronization.

Implement animation production bringing static assets to life (30-40% of timeline). Begin with rough animation blocking major movements establishing timing without detail refinement. Progress to detailed animation adding easing, secondary motion, and polish. Expect 3-5 seconds of finished animation per day for intermediate complexity (simple shapes and text), 1-2 seconds per day for complex character animation or effects-heavy sequences. Build review cycles at 30%, 60%, and 90% completion catching issues before final rendering when changes become expensive.

Finalize through post-production adding effects, color grading, and output optimization (15-20% of timeline). Apply motion blur matching frame rate: 180-degree shutter (50% blur) creates natural movement smoothness, minimal blur maintains crisp technical aesthetic. Perform color correction ensuring consistency across scenes and meeting platform requirements (Rec. 709 for web, DCI-P3 for cinema). Compress for delivery balancing quality and file size: H.264 at 8-12 Mbps for 1080p web delivery, ProRes for archival and future editing.

**AUDIO INTEGRATION AND SONIC BRANDING**

Select music style reinforcing emotional tone and brand personality while avoiding licensing pitfalls. Royalty-free libraries (Epidemic Sound, Artlist) provide $15-30/month unlimited access suitable for most projects. Custom composition costs $500-5,000+ depending on complexity and exclusivity offering unique sonic identity for signature content. Match musical genre to audience and context: corporate uses subtle orchestral or ambient electronic, lifestyle employs indie acoustic or upbeat pop, tech favors electronic or modern classical.

Design sound effects enhancing movement and emphasizing key moments without overwhelming. UI sound design applies subtle whooshes (200-400 Hz) to transitions, pops (2-4 kHz) to appearance animations, and bass hits (60-120 Hz) to emphasis moments. Limit sound effect density to 60-70% of animation moments avoiding constant audio creating fatigue. Layer ambient sound establishing environment and mood: room tone for intimate settings, subtle textures for abstract content.

Synchronize audio and visual achieving unified rhythmic experience. Identify musical beats per minute (BPM) calculating frame alignment: 120 BPM = 2 beats/second = 1 beat every 12 frames at 24fps. Time major visual events (scene transitions, text reveals, key movements) to musical beats creating satisfying synchronization perceived as professional polish even by non-experts. Use audio waveform visualization during animation ensuring visual changes align with audio peaks and transitions.

Implement voiceover when narration enhances comprehension balancing information delivery with visual breathing room. Write scripts for listening not reading: use conversational tone, shorter sentences (8-12 words), and active voice. Budget 140-160 words per minute for comfortable narration pace allowing comprehension without rushing. Leave 0.5-1 second gaps between major script sections providing visual-only moments preventing constant audio creating listener fatigue. Record professional voice talent ($150-500 per finished minute) versus AI voices when authentic human connection matters.

**PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION AND TECHNICAL DELIVERY**

Design platform-specific versions optimizing for viewing context and technical constraints rather than one-size-fits-all approach. Social media vertical (1080x1920, 9:16) prioritizes mobile consumption placing key information in center 60% of frame avoiding thumb zone. YouTube horizontal (1920x1080, 16:9) allows traditional cinematic framing with greater information density. Square format (1080x1080, 1:1) balances mobile and desktop serving Instagram feed and LinkedIn performing well across devices.

Set resolution and frame rate matching platform requirements and audience expectations. Render 1080p (1920x1080) as baseline covering 90% of modern use cases balancing quality and file size. Consider 4K (3840x2160) for premium presentation content, broadcast usage, or future-proofing at 4x file size cost. Use 24fps for cinematic feel in narrative content, 30fps for smoothness in screen recordings or technical demos, 60fps for gaming or sports requiring motion clarity. Avoid interpolated frame rates creating unnatural motion artifacts.

Compress intelligently balancing visual quality and file size constraints. Export H.264 at variable bitrate (VBR) 8-12 Mbps for 1080p achieving transparency for most motion graphics while maintaining manageable file sizes. Use two-pass encoding improving quality consistency versus single-pass especially for variable complexity content. Optimize audio at 192-256 kbps AAC providing broadcast-quality sound without wasteful bitrates. Consider platform-specific codecs: VP9 for YouTube, HEVC for Apple platforms when browser compatibility permits.

Implement accessibility features ensuring inclusive access beyond visual-auditory experience. Provide closed captions for all dialogue and key sound effects using white text on semi-transparent black background at 48-60pt minimum size. Add audio descriptions narrating visual-only information during natural pauses for vision-impaired audiences. Design high-contrast versions for low-vision users increasing color contrast ratios to 7:1 (WCAG AAA). Consider reduced-motion versions for vestibular disorder sufferers removing rapid camera movements and parallax effects triggering discomfort.
