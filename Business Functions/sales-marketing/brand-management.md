# Brand Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage a brand as a system: positioning, identity, messaging, governance, and continuous measurement across touchpoints.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess brand management readiness for [BRAND_NAME] in [INDUSTRY] with current awareness [BRAND_AWARENESS]%. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Positioning & architecture, (2) Identity & messaging system, (3) Governance & enablement, (4) Touchpoint consistency, (5) Brand health measurement, (6) Iteration & evolution. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Positioning & Architecture
- 1 — Initial: Positioning unclear; differentiation weak; brand architecture confusing.
- 3 — Defined: Positioning and value proposition documented; architecture decisions are explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Positioning is defended with proof; architecture scales; differentiation is reinforced consistently.

### 2) Identity & Messaging System
- 1 — Initial: Identity and messaging are inconsistent; assets scattered; teams improvise.
- 3 — Defined: Guidelines, templates, and examples exist; message pillars and proof points defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular asset system; message architecture scales across channels; quality is maintained with minimal friction.

### 3) Governance & Enablement
- 1 — Initial: No clear owners; approvals subjective; teams lack training.
- 3 — Defined: Ownership and decision rights; review workflow; enablement materials.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; teams self-serve; review focuses on principles and evidence.

### 4) Touchpoint Consistency
- 1 — Initial: Customer experience varies by channel; brand drift is common.
- 3 — Defined: Priority touchpoints mapped; standards applied; QA routines exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Consistency is monitored; updates roll out reliably; experience feels coherent end-to-end.

### 5) Brand Health Measurement
- 1 — Initial: No consistent measurement; metrics are sporadic.
- 3 — Defined: Brand health KPIs (awareness, consideration, preference, NPS) with cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement connects to business outcomes; insights drive iteration and investment.

### 6) Iteration & Evolution
- 1 — Initial: Brand changes are reactive; no system for updates.
- 3 — Defined: Planned refresh cadence; feedback loops; controlled updates.
- 5 — Optimized: Brand evolves intentionally; changes are tested; coherence remains stable over time.

## Deliverables
- Brand management readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Positioning and message architecture summary
- Brand standards (identity, tone, templates) and enablement plan
- Governance workflow (owners, approvals, intake)
- Brand health measurement plan and reporting cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry
- [BRAND_AWARENESS]: Awareness baseline
- [CHANNEL_COUNT]: Number of active channels
- [BRAND_CONSISTENCY_SCORE]: Internal/external consistency metric
- [BRAND_HEALTH_METRICS]: Awareness, consideration, preference, NPS, trust

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Growing tech startup with inconsistent messaging
- Scores (1–5): Positioning 3; System 2; Governance 2; Consistency 2; Measurement 2; Evolution 2
- Top gaps: Weak governance; scattered assets; limited brand health reporting
- 90-day priorities: Create standards + templates; define decision rights; implement monthly brand health review
