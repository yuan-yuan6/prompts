# Knowledge Sharing & Organizational Learning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build a **thriving knowledge sharing culture** that captures expertise, accelerates learning, reduces knowledge silos, and drives continuous improvement. Use this to diagnose gaps in knowledge accessibility, expert visibility, and learning systems.

## Template

Conduct a knowledge sharing & organizational learning readiness assessment for {KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (knowledge reuse, expertise accessibility, learning velocity, innovation rate).

**1) KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE & DOCUMENTATION**
- Critical knowledge is identified and prioritized (not just documented randomly)
- Documentation is timely, structured, and findable (not buried in email or drives)
- Tacit knowledge is made explicit (processes, lessons, tribal knowledge)
- Knowledge is versioned, maintained, and retired when obsolete

**2) EXPERTISE VISIBILITY & ACCESSIBILITY**
- Experts are known and discoverable (directory, profiles, recognition)
- Expert time is protected and allocated for knowledge sharing
- Access to experts is equitable (not dependent on informal networks)
- Experts are developed, mentored, and succession-planned

**3) KNOWLEDGE SHARING MECHANISMS**
- Formal mechanisms exist (wikis, repos, training, lunch-and-learns, communities)
- Informal mechanisms thrive (mentorship, shadowing, storytelling, serendipity)
- Mechanisms are fit-for-purpose (right format for right knowledge type)
- Participation is tracked, recognized, and rewarded

**4) LEARNING CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY**
- Learning is valued and resourced (time, budget, leadership support)
- Mistakes are treated as learning opportunities (not failures to hide)
- Questions are welcomed and answered without judgment
- Knowledge hoarding is discouraged; sharing is celebrated

**5) KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS & TOOLS**
- Knowledge management platform is adopted and integrated (not shelfware)
- Search and discovery are effective (find answers in <2 minutes)
- Content is tagged, categorized, and linked for navigation
- Systems enable contribution, feedback, and quality curation

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Knowledge sharing is measured (contributions, reuse, time-to-answer, satisfaction)
- Learning velocity is tracked (onboarding time, skill acquisition, problem-solving speed)
- Gaps and silos are identified and addressed systematically
- Best practices are captured, shared, and scaled

- Participation rates and user satisfaction

5) **KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS AUDIT**
- Tools in use, adoption rates, and findability scores
- Integration, search effectiveness, and user experience

6) **30/60/90-DAY KNOWLEDGE ACCELERATION PLAN**
- Actions to improve capture, accessibility, and learning culture
- Metrics (knowledge reuse, time-to-answer, onboarding time, expert accessibility)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (knowledge trapped in heads, silos, no systems)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic documentation, inconsistent sharing, limited culture)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid mechanisms, visible experts, growing culture)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high reuse, fast learning, measured improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (knowledge as competitive advantage, continuous innovation)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}: Org size, knowledge complexity, turnover risk, current sharing maturity
- {OBJECTIVES}: Knowledge reuse, learning velocity, expert accessibility, and innovation goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Budget, expert capacity, tool limitations, geographic/cultural barriers

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT}: 800-person manufacturing company. 25% of workforce eligible for retirement in 3 years (knowledge risk). Current knowledge capture: ad hoc (90% in email/heads). No expert directory. Onboarding takes 6 months (goal 3). Knowledge sharing culture: 35% "I know where to find answers" (survey). Siloed by plant location (5 facilities).
- {OBJECTIVES}: Reduce onboarding time to 3 months, increase "can find answers" to 75%, create expert directory covering top 20 domains, capture critical knowledge from retiring workforce, launch 3 communities of practice.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $75K budget; no knowledge management staff; 5 plant locations (limited connectivity); cultural norm of "knowledge is power"; retiring experts overloaded with work.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.1 (Developing)
- Key risks: 25% retirement wave threatens loss of 30+ years of tribal knowledge; 6-month onboarding wastes $2M/year in lost productivity; silos duplicate work and miss best practices
- Top improvements: (1) launch retirement knowledge capture program, (2) build expert directory, (3) pilot communities of practice in top 3 domains

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Knowledge Capture & Documentation: 2/5 — ad hoc, email-based, no structure; critical knowledge undocumented
- Expertise Visibility & Accessibility: 2/5 — experts known informally; no directory; access depends on relationships
- Knowledge Sharing Mechanisms: 2/5 — monthly safety meetings only formal mechanism; no mentorship program
- Learning Culture & Safety: 3/5 — apprenticeships exist; mistakes penalized; questions seen as weakness
- Knowledge Systems & Tools: 2/5 — shared drives (no search); no wiki; email is primary repository
- Measurement & Improvement: 2/5 — onboarding time tracked; no knowledge reuse or sharing metrics

**3) KNOWLEDGE LANDSCAPE MAP**
- Critical knowledge domains (20):
  - Manufacturing processes (extrusion, molding, assembly, quality control)
  - Equipment maintenance (12 legacy machines, vendor relationships)
  - Safety protocols (OSHA compliance, incident response)
  - Customer requirements (specifications, customization processes)
  - Supply chain relationships (sourcing, logistics, vendor management)
  - Regulatory compliance (environmental, labor, industry-specific)
  - Troubleshooting (common failures, root cause analysis)
  - Leadership/tribal knowledge (history, culture, decision context)
- Knowledge gaps: digital manufacturing, automation, predictive maintenance, sustainability practices
- Single-points-of-failure: 12 retiring experts (8 with >30 years tenure) holding undocumented process knowledge
- Expert inventory: 45 identified experts across 20 domains; 15 retirement-eligible; no succession plans

**4) SHARING MECHANISMS INVENTORY**
- Formal mechanisms:
  - Monthly plant safety meetings (effective, 90% attendance, safety-focused only)
  - Quarterly all-hands (limited interaction, top-down, no knowledge sharing)
  - Apprenticeship program (effective, 1:1 mentorship, 20 apprentices/year)
  - Training manuals (outdated, not maintained, text-heavy, hard to find)
- Informal mechanisms:
  - "Ask Joe" culture (experts known by reputation, accessed via hallway conversations)
  - Lunch conversations (plant-specific, siloed, not captured)
  - Troubleshooting phone calls between shifts (reactive, not documented)
- Gaps:
  - No communities of practice or cross-plant learning
  - No lunch-and-learns or knowledge-sharing events
  - No mentorship program beyond apprenticeships
  - No after-action reviews or lessons-learned process
- Participation rates: 95% attend safety meetings (required), <5% contribute to shared drives voluntarily
- User satisfaction: 40% "can find knowledge when needed," 25% "feel confident asking questions"

**5) KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS AUDIT**
- Tools in use:
  - Shared network drives (90% usage, organized by person/plant, no taxonomy, no search)
  - Email (primary knowledge repository, tribal knowledge buried in threads)
  - Training manuals (PDFs on shared drive, not searchable, no version control)
  - Paper binders (machine manuals, quality specs, still primary for shop floor)
- Adoption rates: shared drives 90%, manuals 60%, paper binders 80%
- Findability score: avg 4.5 minutes to find answer (goal <2 min); 35% "I know where to find answers"
- Integration: none—tools disconnected, no single source of truth
- Search effectiveness: no search capability (browsing folders only); file naming inconsistent
- User experience: "frustrating," "time-consuming," "easier to ask someone"

**6) 30/60/90-DAY KNOWLEDGE ACCELERATION PLAN**
- 30 days: launch retirement knowledge capture (interview 5 retiring experts, document top 10 processes); create expert directory spreadsheet (name, domain, contact, availability); pilot "Friday knowledge share" at 1 plant (15-min shop-floor demos)
- 60 days: establish 3 communities of practice (safety, quality, maintenance) with monthly virtual meetings; launch wiki pilot (10 core processes documented); train 10 knowledge champions (1–2 per plant)
- 90 days: roll out after-action reviews post-incidents; expand wiki to 50 processes; measure knowledge reuse (wiki page views, expert directory queries); survey "can find answers" (goal 50%)
- Metrics: onboarding time (goal 5 months by 90 days), "can find answers" (goal 50%), expert directory coverage (goal 20 domains), retirement knowledge captured (goal 30 processes)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Prioritize knowledge capture ruthlessly: focus on critical domains, retiring experts, and high-impact processes first.
2) Make experts visible and accessible: create a searchable directory with domains, availability, and contribution recognition.
3) Build for findability: use consistent taxonomy, tagging, and search to enable <2-minute discovery.
4) Blend formal and informal: combine structured repositories with storytelling, mentorship, and serendipitous learning.
5) Measure knowledge reuse, not just creation: track page views, time-to-answer, onboarding time, and problem-solving speed.
6) Create psychological safety: celebrate questions, share mistakes openly, and reward knowledge sharing visibly.
7) Launch communities of practice to break silos: connect experts across teams to share best practices and solve problems.
8) Treat knowledge as an asset: allocate time for documentation, protect expert availability, and retire outdated content.
