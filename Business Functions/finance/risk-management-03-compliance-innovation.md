# Risk Management Readiness Assessment — Compliance & Innovation

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to meet regulatory expectations, govern model risk, run stress testing, and safely adopt advanced analytics and emerging-risk capabilities.

## Quick Prompt
Assess compliance and innovation readiness for [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME] under [REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS]. Evaluate regulatory mapping and change management, examination readiness and reporting, model inventory and validation, stress testing and capital planning, emerging risks (climate/ESG/digital), and AI/ML governance and controls. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Regulatory Mapping & Change Management
- 1: Obligations are implicit; changes are handled reactively.
- 3: Core obligations mapped; periodic monitoring.
- 5: Systematic monitoring, impact assessment, and tracked implementation.

2) Examination Readiness & Reporting Discipline
- 1: Evidence is scattered; reporting is inconsistent.
- 3: Standard reports exist; readiness varies by topic.
- 5: Evidence library, clear owners, and repeatable exam playbooks.

3) Model Risk Management (Inventory, Validation, Monitoring)
- 1: Model inventory is incomplete; validation is ad hoc.
- 3: Inventory exists; validation is periodic for key models.
- 5: Full lifecycle governance (approval, monitoring, change control, retirement).

4) Stress Testing & Capital / Liquidity Planning
- 1: Stress testing is sporadic and not decision-linked.
- 3: Standard scenarios exist for major cycles.
- 5: Scenario design, governance, and management actions are consistent.

5) Emerging Risks (Climate/ESG/Digital) Integration
- 1: Emerging risks are discussed but not measured.
- 3: Initial policies and reporting exist for key areas.
- 5: Integrated assessment, scenarios, and disclosures with ownership.

6) Innovation Governance (AI/ML, Analytics, Data Controls)
- 1: Innovation is unmanaged; controls lag.
- 3: Some governance exists for high-risk use cases.
- 5: Use-case governance, validation, bias/testing, and monitoring are standard.

## Deliverables
- Regulatory obligation map with owners and monitoring cadence
- Examination readiness pack (evidence library, reporting calendar, playbooks)
- Model inventory and validation plan (tiers, cadence, change control)
- Stress test program summary (scenarios, results, triggers, actions)
- Emerging risk register (climate/ESG/digital) with measurement approach

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — compliance and models managed case-by-case.
- Level 2: Documented — policies exist; enforcement varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — governance and reporting are standard for key areas.
- Level 4: Managed — monitoring, validation, and change control are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from findings and outcomes.

## Variables
- [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME]
- [REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS]
- [REPORTING_REQUIREMENTS]
- [MODEL_INVENTORY]
- [STRESS_SCENARIOS]
- [CAPITAL_LIQUIDITY_TARGETS]
- [EMERGING_RISK_TOPICS]
- [AI_ML_USE_CASES]

## Example (Condensed)
Large regional bank preparing for supervisory stress testing.
- Compliance: obligation map and exam evidence library with owners.
- Models: tiered inventory, validation calendar, and change control.
- Innovation: AI/ML use-case governance with monitoring and bias testing.
