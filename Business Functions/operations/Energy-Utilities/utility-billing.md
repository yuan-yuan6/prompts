# Utility Billing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run or modernize utility billing with accurate meter data, rate plans, customer communications, and compliance.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess utility billing readiness for billing system [SYSTEM]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Meter data quality, (2) Rate plan configuration, (3) Billing operations, (4) Customer experience & disputes, (5) Compliance & auditability, (6) Reliability & change management. Provide a scorecard and modernization plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Meter Data Quality
- 1 — Initial: Meter data incomplete; errors common.
- 3 — Defined: Data validation and reconciliation processes exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Data quality is high with automated checks and anomaly detection.

### 2) Rate Plan Configuration
- 1 — Initial: Rate rules unclear; changes risky.
- 3 — Defined: Rate plans documented; configuration managed with reviews.
- 5 — Optimized: Rate changes are safe, tested, and auditable.

### 3) Billing Operations
- 1 — Initial: Billing cycles unstable; manual rework common.
- 3 — Defined: Stable billing operations with SOPs and exception handling.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are optimized with automation and low error rates.

### 4) Customer Experience & Disputes
- 1 — Initial: Disputes frequent; communications unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Clear communications and dispute workflows.
- 5 — Optimized: Customer experience is strong; disputes are resolved efficiently.

### 5) Compliance & Auditability
- 1 — Initial: Audit trails missing; compliance gaps likely.
- 3 — Defined: Audit trails and compliance reporting exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Auditability is robust; controls support frequent audits.

### 6) Reliability & Change Management
- 1 — Initial: Changes break billing; outages impact cycles.
- 3 — Defined: Change management and testing processes exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Reliability is high with strong release, rollback, and monitoring.

## Deliverables
- Billing readiness scorecard and gap list
- Meter data validation and reconciliation plan
- Rate plan governance and testing approach
- Billing ops SOPs and exception playbooks
- Compliance/audit reporting pack

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [SYSTEM]: Billing system
- [METER_DATA]: Meter data sources
- [RATES]: Rate plans
- [CYCLE]: Billing cycle
- [COMPLIANCE]: Compliance requirements
- [DISPUTES]: Dispute volumes

## Example (Condensed)
- System: Billing modernization for AMI rollout
- Scores (1–5): Meter data 2; Rates 3; Ops 2; CX 2; Compliance 3; Reliability 2
- 90-day priorities: Automate meter reconciliation; improve release testing; standardize dispute workflows; strengthen monitoring
