# Financial Statement Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to analyze financial statements in a way that is comparable over time, consistent across analysts, and usable for decisions (credit, investment, board reporting).

## Quick Prompt
Assess statement-analysis readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] for [ANALYSIS_PERIOD] using [STATEMENT_YEARS] years of data. Evaluate data completeness and reconciliation, normalization discipline, core analysis methods, cash flow and working capital rigor, benchmarking context, and governance/storytelling. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Data Coverage & Reconciliation
- 1: Statements are incomplete; definitions vary; reconciliations are missing.
- 3: Core statements exist; reconciliation happens for major cycles.
- 5: Traceable sources, reconciliations, and consistent definitions are standard.

2) Normalization & Adjustments Discipline
- 1: One-time items and accounting changes are handled inconsistently.
- 3: Adjustments are noted but not standardized.
- 5: Adjustment log (rationale/source) is maintained and consistently applied.

3) Core Methods & KPIs
- 1: Methods vary by analyst; outputs are inconsistent.
- 3: Common-size and trend views exist for key cycles.
- 5: Standard method set (common-size, growth, margins, bridges) is enforced.

4) Cash Flow & Working Capital Rigor
- 1: Cash flow is summarized; working capital drivers are unclear.
- 3: OCF/FCF tracked; working capital drivers reviewed periodically.
- 5: Cash conversion drivers (DSO/DIO/DPO) and bridges are standard.

5) Benchmarking & Context
- 1: Results are interpreted without peers or historical context.
- 3: Benchmarking used for high-stakes decisions.
- 5: Peer criteria, benchmark sources, and refresh cadence are defined.

6) Governance, Review & Decision Narrative
- 1: No review checklist; conclusions vary by author.
- 3: Review occurs for major packages.
- 5: QA gates, sign-offs, and consistent executive storytelling are standard.

## Deliverables
- Statement pack (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) with reconciliation notes
- Common-size and trend views (multi-year) with key drivers
- Adjustment log (one-time items, accounting changes, normalization)
- Working capital and cash conversion commentary (drivers and implications)
- Key findings and questions list aligned to the decision context

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent inputs and interpretations.
- Level 2: Documented — templates exist but methods vary.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard methods used for most decisions.
- Level 4: Managed — cash flow rigor and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from outcomes and feedback.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [ANALYSIS_PERIOD]
- [STATEMENT_YEARS]
- [ACCOUNTING_POLICY_NOTES]
- [NORMALIZATION_ADJUSTMENTS]
- [PEER_SET]
- [DECISION_CONTEXT] (credit, investment, board reporting)

## Example (Condensed)
Board packet for a mid-market retailer.
- Inputs: 5 years statements reconciled; lease accounting change documented.
- Methods: common-size P&L, margin bridge, working capital driver review.
- Context: peer medians and historical ranges.
- Output: key findings + questions + implications for liquidity and funding.
