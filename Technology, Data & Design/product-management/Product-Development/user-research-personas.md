## Template

Conduct a comprehensive user research readiness assessment for {PRODUCT_NAME}, targeting {TARGET_USERS} to answer {KEY_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS}.

Assess research capability across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. RESEARCH OPERATIONS & INFRASTRUCTURE**
Assess whether the organization has established research operations enabling efficient and ethical study execution, evaluating whether participant recruitment processes exist with reliable pipelines for reaching target users across segments including screening criteria development and incentive management, whether research logistics are streamlined including scheduling tools, video conferencing platforms for remote studies, lab facilities for in-person research when needed, and digital collaboration spaces for synthesis, whether ethical and legal foundations are solid with informed consent processes, IRB review protocols when applicable, data privacy protections including secure storage and retention policies, and participant confidentiality safeguards, whether research tools and technology support the work including user research platforms like UserTesting or Lookback, survey tools with appropriate sampling and distribution capabilities, analysis software for qualitative and quantitative data, and repositories for organizing research artifacts, whether budget allocation supports research needs with dedicated funding for participant incentives, tools and subscriptions, and external recruiting services or research agencies when needed, whether staffing models provide appropriate research capacity including dedicated researchers, embedded researchers within product teams, or distributed research practitioners among PMs and designers with clear role definition, and whether documentation practices preserve institutional knowledge with research repositories, standardized templates for protocols and reports, and accessible archives that enable teams to build on previous learnings rather than restarting from scratch.

**2. METHODOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION & RIGOR**
Evaluate the breadth and depth of research methodologies the team can execute competently by assessing whether qualitative research techniques are mastered including in-depth interviews with effective probing and listening skills, contextual inquiry and ethnographic observation capturing natural behaviors in situ, diary studies for longitudinal understanding of behaviors over time, usability testing with appropriate task design and think-aloud protocols, and focus groups when appropriate for exploring social dynamics and group perspectives, whether quantitative methods complement qualitative insights including survey design with proper sampling strategies and unbiased question construction, analytics analysis connecting behavioral data to user needs and contexts, A/B testing for validating hypotheses about user preferences, and basic statistical analysis for identifying significant patterns versus noise, whether method selection demonstrates sophistication by matching research questions to appropriate methodologies rather than defaulting to familiar approaches, recognizing when to use exploratory versus evaluative methods, understanding tradeoffs between depth and breadth in sampling, and combining methods strategically for triangulation, whether research design quality is evident through clear objectives and hypotheses, appropriate participant criteria and sample sizes for reliable insights, unbiased protocols that avoid leading questions and confirmation bias, and proper control conditions when testing concepts or designs, whether execution quality maintains rigor with consistent facilitation approaches, accurate documentation including verbatim transcription when needed, quality checks ensuring data integrity, and proper handling of unexpected situations or outlier participants, and whether the team stays current with emerging methods including remote research techniques, unmoderated testing approaches, international and cross-cultural research adaptations, and specialized techniques for specific domains like B2B research or research with vulnerable populations.

**3. SYNTHESIS & INSIGHT GENERATION CAPABILITY**
Determine the organization's ability to transform raw research data into actionable product insights by evaluating whether analysis processes are systematic with clear frameworks for coding qualitative data, collaborative synthesis sessions that bring diverse perspectives, affinity diagramming or thematic analysis for pattern identification, and structured approaches to surfacing insights rather than cherry-picking convenient findings, whether insight quality is high with findings that go beyond surface observations to reveal underlying needs and motivations, insights grounded in evidence with clear connection to specific data points and representative quotes, prioritization that distinguishes critical insights from interesting but less actionable observations, and nuanced understanding that captures complexity rather than oversimplifying user diversity, whether artifacts effectively communicate findings through journey maps that visualize end-to-end user experiences with emotional dimensions and pain points, empathy maps capturing user thoughts and feelings in contexts, mental models revealing how users conceptualize domains and make decisions, and opportunity maps connecting insights to product and design implications, whether insights drive action with clear connections between research findings and product recommendations, implications spelled out for design, engineering, and go-to-market teams, tradeoffs and constraints acknowledged when user needs conflict with business goals or technical feasibility, and success metrics proposed for measuring whether solutions address identified needs, whether the team demonstrates analytical sophistication by recognizing when sample sizes are insufficient for generalization, distinguishing correlation from causation in behavioral patterns, identifying bias in their own analysis and controlling for it, and knowing when additional research is needed before drawing conclusions, and whether cross-study synthesis happens to connect findings across multiple research initiatives, track how understanding evolves over time, identify consistent themes versus changing patterns, and build comprehensive knowledge rather than treating each study in isolation.

**4. PERSONA DEVELOPMENT & USER MODELING**
Assess the quality and utility of persona development practices by evaluating whether personas are evidence-based with every persona element grounded in actual research data rather than assumptions or aspirations, personas derived from clear segmentation logic based on behavioral patterns or needs rather than demographics alone, representation validated through sufficient participant sample across identified segments, and regular updates ensuring personas remain current as users and markets evolve, whether personas are behavior-focused capturing goals and motivations that drive actions, jobs-to-be-done that reveal what users are trying to accomplish in specific contexts, pain points and frustrations with current solutions, decision-making processes and criteria, workflow contexts and environmental constraints, and behavioral patterns including triggers, workarounds, and success indicators rather than superficial demographic profiles, whether persona architecture is appropriate with the right number of personas to capture meaningful diversity without overwhelming teams with too many profiles, primary versus secondary persona distinctions clear, anti-personas defined to clarify who you're not targeting, and relationships between personas understood when they interact in B2B or multi-stakeholder contexts, whether personas feel realistic and memorable through narrative storytelling that brings them to life, representative quotes from actual research participants, contextual details that help teams visualize the persona's world, and visual design including photos and layout that makes personas reference-worthy rather than dense documents, whether personas inform product decisions with explicit connections to feature prioritization showing which personas benefit from which capabilities, design implications guiding interface and experience decisions, go-to-market strategy informing messaging and channel selection, and success metrics tied to persona needs and satisfaction, and whether persona quality avoids common pitfalls including relying on stereotypes or assumptions not validated by research, focusing excessively on demographics over behaviors and goals, creating "perfect" personas that don't reflect real user diversity and constraints, and building personas that describe existing customers only while missing potential users or emerging segments.

**5. ORGANIZATIONAL INTEGRATION & RESEARCH CULTURE**
Evaluate how effectively user research is embedded in organizational processes and decision-making by assessing whether research is integrated into product development with research inputs at discovery phase before solutions are defined, concept validation before committing to detailed design or development, usability testing before launch to identify experience issues, and post-launch evaluation to measure whether solutions addressed identified needs, whether cross-functional engagement is strong with product managers actively commissioning research and incorporating findings into roadmaps, designers using research to inform experience decisions and validate design hypotheses, engineers understanding user contexts to make better technical tradeoffs, and executives referencing user insights in strategic planning and resource allocation, whether research democratization is achieved through training that enables PMs and designers to conduct lightweight research themselves, self-service tools and templates for common research needs, clear guidance on when to involve professional researchers versus conducting studies independently, and research operations that remove friction from accessing users, whether stakeholder alignment on research is evident through shared understanding of target users and their needs, agreement on key user problems to solve, research roadmaps aligned to product strategy and organizational priorities, and regular research reviews that keep user perspectives visible, whether research has credibility and influence demonstrated by product decisions explicitly referencing research findings, design reviews using personas and journey maps as evaluation criteria, feature debates resolved with user evidence rather than opinions, and budget allocated based on understanding of user value and willingness to pay, and whether cultural indicators suggest research maturity including curiosity about users evident in questions asked, humility about assumptions with willingness to be proven wrong, celebration of learning rather than only validating existing beliefs, and discomfort when making decisions without user input.

**6. CONTINUOUS LEARNING & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT**
Assess the organization's ability to build cumulative user understanding over time by evaluating whether research cadence is appropriate with strategic research conducted regularly to maintain updated market and user understanding, tactical research embedded in product development cycles for ongoing validation, pulse research providing lightweight continuous feedback, and longitudinal studies tracking how user needs and behaviors evolve, whether knowledge management preserves and surfaces insights through centralized research repositories accessible to all teams, tagging and search capabilities that help teams discover relevant past research, synthesis documents that distill cross-study findings into accessible formats, and living documents like persona libraries and journey maps that are actively maintained, whether research planning is strategic with annual research roadmaps aligned to business priorities, portfolio management balancing exploratory and evaluative research, coordination across teams to avoid redundant studies and share learnings, and resource allocation optimizing for highest-impact questions, whether learning loops close effectively with research findings tracked to see which influenced decisions, impact assessment measuring whether research-informed changes improved outcomes, retrospectives evaluating research effectiveness and methodology choices, and feedback to researchers enabling continuous improvement of research practice, whether research evolves with the organization through persona refreshes as segments mature or markets shift, journey maps updated to reflect product changes and new touchpoints, methodology adaptation as the product scales and user bases diversify, and research maturity development as the organization grows, and whether institutional knowledge builds systematically with new team members onboarded to user understanding, tribal knowledge codified into documented insights, research practices documented as playbooks and templates, and research community of practice fostering skill development and methodology discussion.

## Usage Example

### B2B SaaS Project Management Platform - User Research Readiness Assessment

**Context:** Momentum is a project management platform for software teams at startups and scale-ups (10-200 employees). After two years in market with 2,500 active teams and $3.5M ARR, the company recognizes that product decisions are driven more by competitor feature parity and founder intuition than deep user understanding. Recent initiatives have underperformed—a major roadmap feature achieved only 12% adoption, and trial-to-paid conversion has declined from 18% to 14% over six months. The executive team commissioned this assessment to determine whether investing in user research capability would improve product decision quality and business outcomes.

**Assessment Conducted:** Q4 2025  
**Evaluated By:** VP Product, Head of Design, User Research Consultant  
**Assessment Duration:** 3 weeks (stakeholder interviews, artifact review, process observation)

#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Maturity Score: 2.1/5.0** (Reactive stage, early development)

Momentum has minimal systematic user research capability. The organization conducts occasional ad-hoc user interviews when specific questions arise, but lacks research operations, methodological sophistication, and integration of findings into product decisions. Personas were created during initial product development but are outdated, demographic-focused, and unused in current planning. Product decisions primarily reference customer requests from support tickets, competitive intelligence, and founder vision rather than validated user insights. This research gap manifests in poor feature adoption, declining conversion rates, and lack of understanding about why users choose competing products or abandon trials.

**Top 3 Critical Gaps:**
1. **No systematic understanding of why trials fail to convert** - Only 14% of trial signups convert to paid (down from 18% six months ago), but the team cannot explain this decline. Without research into trial user experiences, the team is blindly adjusting pricing, features, and onboarding based on assumptions rather than diagnosed friction points.
2. **Outdated personas not grounded in current user base** - Existing personas reflect the founding team's hypotheses from two years ago about "small startup engineering teams," but actual customers now span product, design, and business teams at scale-ups. Product decisions reference personas that don't match current users, leading to misaligned features and messaging.
3. **No research operations infrastructure** - The team has no participant recruitment process, no tools beyond basic video calls, no budget for incentives, and no repository for past learnings. When teams want to conduct research, the logistics take weeks to arrange and findings exist only in individual documents, preventing organization-wide learning.

**Recommended Investment:** $245-290K over 6 months including senior user researcher hire ($150K half-year), research tools and infrastructure ($15K), participant recruiting and incentives budget ($40K), training for PM and design teams ($20K), and external research agency for initial studies ($20-45K)

**Target Outcome:** Achieve 3.5/5.0 maturity by month 6, enabling quarterly strategic research on user segments and needs, research integration into all major product initiatives, evidence-based personas actively used in planning, and 25%+ improvement in trial conversion through research-informed onboarding optimization

#### DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Current State | Primary Gap/Strength |
|-----------|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Research Operations** | 1.7/5.0 | Ad-hoc | No participant recruitment process, no tools, no budget; research takes weeks to arrange |
| **Methodological Sophistication** | 2.3/5.0 | Reactive | Team can conduct basic interviews; lacks skills in usability testing, synthesis, survey design |
| **Synthesis & Insight Generation** | 1.9/5.0 | Ad-hoc | Findings documented in scattered slides; no systematic pattern identification or journey mapping |
| **Persona Development** | 1.8/5.0 | Ad-hoc | Outdated demographic personas from two years ago; not referenced in current product decisions |
| **Organizational Integration** | 2.4/5.0 | Reactive | STRENGTH: Team values user input; GAP: No process for incorporating research into decisions |
| **Continuous Learning** | 2.0/5.0 | Reactive | Occasional studies when crises emerge; no strategic research cadence or knowledge repository |

**Overall Assessment:** Momentum is attempting to scale product decisions without the user research foundation necessary for customer-driven development. The team's willingness to conduct interviews demonstrates research appetite, but lack of infrastructure, skills, and process prevents research from informing decisions effectively. Investment in research capability will determine whether the company continues product development based on assumptions or builds systematic user understanding that improves outcomes.

#### CRITICAL GAPS ANALYSIS

**Gap 1: Trial Conversion Mystery (Impact: Critical | Urgency: Immediate)**

**Manifestation:** Trial-to-paid conversion has declined from 18% to 14% over six months (278 fewer paid customers, approximately $430K annual recurring revenue lost). The team cannot explain this decline or diagnose where trial users encounter friction. Hypotheses exist—"pricing is confusing," "onboarding is too long," "users don't understand value"—but no research validates which, if any, are accurate. Recent attempts to improve conversion changed onboarding flow based on analytics alone, but conversion continued declining, suggesting the team optimized for the wrong problem.

**Business Consequences:**
- $430K ARR loss continuing to compound as conversion stays low
- Customer acquisition cost increases as more marketing spend is required to offset lower conversion efficiency (CAC increased 31% in past quarter)
- Product and design teams making blind changes that don't address root causes, wasting engineering capacity on ineffective solutions
- Board concern about growth efficiency and path to profitability with deteriorating unit economics

**Root Cause:** No systematic trial user research. The team tracks analytics (signup, activation events, feature usage) but doesn't understand user mental models, expectations, or experience. Past attempts at user interviews were with existing customers who successfully converted, not trial users who abandoned, creating survivor bias.

**Recommended Action:** Conduct immediate trial user research with two parallel tracks: (1) 15-20 interviews with trial users who didn't convert within 7 days of trial start, probing expectations, experience, friction points, and alternatives considered; (2) 10 usability tests with new trial users observing first-session experience and activation journey. Complete within 4 weeks. Expected outcome: Diagnosed top 3-5 conversion barriers with prioritized optimization roadmap.

**Gap 2: Persona-Reality Mismatch (Impact: High | Urgency: High)**

**Manifestation:** Existing personas describe "small startup engineering teams (5-15 developers) using agile methodologies." Current customer analysis reveals that 58% of revenue comes from scale-ups (50-200 employees) with cross-functional teams (product, design, marketing, operations), not just engineering. Product roadmap priorities reference the outdated personas, leading to engineering-focused features while actual customers want cross-functional collaboration capabilities. Recent customer churn interviews revealed that teams leave for competitors offering better multi-departmental workflows.

**Business Consequences:**
- Misaligned product investment: engineering sprint tracking features achieve 25% adoption while cross-functional collaboration needs go unmet
- Churn to competitors (Asana, Monday.com) who better serve multi-departmental teams; churn rate increased from 3.2% to 4.7% monthly
- Marketing messaging targeting wrong audience; paid acquisition attracts small eng teams with lower LTV ($1,200) vs scale-up teams ($4,800 average)
- Sales team selling against outdated personas, missing expansion opportunities with current customers' adjacent teams

**Root Cause:** Personas created two years ago during MVP phase reflected founders' target users but were never updated as product-market fit evolved and customer mix shifted. No process exists for persona validation or refresh.

**Recommended Action:** Conduct comprehensive user segmentation research including 30-40 customer interviews across revenue tiers and team types, usage analytics to identify behavioral patterns, and firmographic analysis. Develop 3-4 new behavior-based personas grounded in current user base. Complete within 8 weeks. Socialize through workshops with product, design, sales, and marketing.

**Gap 3: No Research Operations Infrastructure (Impact: High | Urgency: Medium)**

**Manifestation:** When teams want to conduct research, no established process exists. Recruiting participants requires manual outreach through customer success team or posting in product Slack channels, yielding 2-5 volunteers after 1-2 weeks. No incentive budget exists, so only highly engaged customers participate, creating bias toward power users. No research tools beyond Zoom and Google Docs. Past research findings live in individual Google Slides decks scattered across Drive, inaccessible to new team members or those who didn't participate in specific studies.

**Business Consequences:**
- Research velocity is extremely slow; studies take 3-4 weeks to organize before any insights are generated, too slow for sprint-based development
- Selection bias from convenience sampling means insights reflect power users, not broader segments including at-risk or lower-engagement users
- Lost institutional knowledge as team members leave; new hires start from zero user understanding rather than building on existing knowledge
- Redundant research as different teams ask the same questions without knowing past studies occurred

**Root Cause:** User research treated as nice-to-have rather than critical product capability. No dedicated researcher means no one owns operations. No budget allocated because research value hasn't been demonstrated. Classic chicken-egg problem.

**Recommended Action:** Establish foundational research operations in first 90 days: (1) Implement participant recruiting panel using tool like Respondent or User Interviews with pre-screened segments ($8K setup + $3K/month); (2) Create incentive budget ($40K annually = ~80 study sessions); (3) Implement research repository using Dovetail or Notion with templates ($5K annually); (4) Build recruitment email templates and screening surveys. Assign ownership to first researcher hire.

**Gap 4: Limited Methodological Capability Beyond Interviews (Impact: Medium | Urgency: Medium)**

**Manifestation:** Team conducts occasional user interviews when questions arise, demonstrating willingness to talk to users, but lacks capability in other critical research methods. No one has conducted usability testing (critical for diagnosing UX issues), surveys (needed for quantifying patterns), diary studies (valuable for understanding workflows over time), or ethnographic observation. This limits the team to exploratory understanding while struggling with evaluative research needed to validate designs or compare alternatives.

**Business Consequences:**
- Cannot diagnose UX issues systematically; when users report "the product is confusing," team can't observe where confusion occurs or test alternative designs
- Cannot quantify how widespread qualitative insights are; after 5 interviews revealing pricing confusion, no way to determine if this affects 20% or 80% of users
- Cannot understand multi-day workflows that span beyond single sessions; misses context about how product fits into broader work patterns

**Root Cause:** No one on the team has formal user research training. PMs and designers learned basic interviewing through experience but haven't developed broader methodological skills. No mentorship or training available.

**Recommended Action:** Two-pronged approach: (1) Hire senior user researcher with diverse methodological expertise to execute sophisticated studies and mentor team; (2) Provide foundational UX research training for PM and design teams through workshop series covering usability testing, survey design, and synthesis techniques (12 hours over 6 weeks, $8K external trainer). First research projects should include usability testing of trial onboarding and survey quantifying feature value perceptions.

**Gap 5: Findings Don't Drive Product Decisions (Impact: High | Urgency: Low)**

**Manifestation:** Past research studies produced insights, but team struggles to translate findings into product action. A study six months ago revealed that users found task assignment "too rigid" and wanted more flexibility, but this finding sat in a presentation deck and wasn't prioritized on roadmap until three customers churned citing this issue. No clear process exists for moving from research insight to product decision to roadmap inclusion. Research feels like "interesting to know" rather than "must act on."

**Business Consequences:**
- Research ROI is invisible because insights don't translate to improvements, making it hard to justify future research investment
- Teams feel research is theoretical rather than practical, reducing engagement with research initiatives
- Critical issues identified in research aren't addressed until they become crisis-level problems measured in churn or support tickets

**Root Cause:** Cultural and process gap between research and product development. No established forum for reviewing research findings and making prioritization decisions. No framework for evaluating insight urgency or business impact. PMs don't feel accountable to research findings.

**Recommended Action:** Establish research integration rituals: (1) Monthly "research readout" where recent findings are presented with explicit product implications and proposed actions; (2) Add "validated by user research" as criterion in roadmap prioritization framework; (3) Require major features to include "user evidence" section in PRD describing research supporting the need; (4) Track metric: % of roadmap items informed by user research, targeting 70%+ within 6 months. Start with low-friction implementations before requiring heavy process.
