# Investment Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build an investing approach across six dimensions: goals/horizon, risk capacity, portfolio design, account/tax fit, contribution system, and behavioral discipline.

## Template

Conduct an investment strategy readiness assessment for {INVESTOR_PROFILE} pursuing {INVESTING_GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) GOALS & TIME HORIZON**
- Goals are defined (retirement, house, education, FI) with timeframes
- Liquidity needs vs long-term investing separated
- Emergency cash and near-term needs are not mixed into long-term risk

**2) RISK CAPACITY & TOLERANCE**
- Ability to take risk (income stability, debt load, buffer)
- Emotional tolerance for drawdowns (staying invested)
- Constraints and guardrails defined (max loss comfort, rebalancing limits)

**3) PORTFOLIO DESIGN & DIVERSIFICATION**
- Clear approach (broad index funds, target-date, diversified mix)
- Fees and complexity kept low
- Rebalancing plan exists

**4) ACCOUNT & TAX FIT**
- Account types aligned to goals (tax-advantaged vs taxable)
- Basic tax awareness (contributions, withholding, capital gains timing)
- Documentation and beneficiary basics considered

**5) CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM**
- Automated contributions and minimum monthly target
- Plan for variable income months
- Decision rule for windfalls and bonuses

**6) BEHAVIOR & PROCESS**
- Avoids reactive decisions (panic selling, chasing performance)
- Review cadence (quarterly/annual) rather than constant checking
- Simple “investing policy” written in plain language

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 30 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **ACCOUNT & PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDATION (GENERIC)**
- Recommend a general approach (e.g., target-date vs simple index mix)
- Contribution cadence and rebalancing approach

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency

5) **12-MONTH PLAN**
- Month 1–3 setup, Month 4–12 execution
- Include review cadence and drift thresholds

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs targets: contribution consistency, savings rate, fees, diversification, behavior adherence

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (inconsistent or speculative)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some investing, major gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable strategy, reasonable discipline)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (consistent contributions, low fees, planned rebalancing)
- 5.0: Optimized (long-term system with strong behavioral adherence)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {INVESTOR_PROFILE} | Income stability, experience, accounts | “New investor, stable job, 401(k) available” |
| {INVESTING_GOALS} | Goals + horizons | “Retirement in 30 years; home down payment in 5 years” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “Low time; wants simple approach; $300/month start” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {INVESTOR_PROFILE}: New investor, stable income, employer 401(k) match available, no investing plan
- {INVESTING_GOALS}: Long-term retirement investing; avoid overthinking
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 15 minutes/month; start at $300/month and increase quarterly

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.3/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) automate contributions, (2) choose a simple diversified approach, (3) write a 1-page investing rule set

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Goals & Time Horizon | 4.0 | Clear long-term goal | Separate short-term cash needs |
| Risk Capacity & Tolerance | 3.5 | Stable income | Define drawdown comfort |
| Portfolio Design | 3.0 | Wants simplicity | Pick one diversified approach |
| Account & Tax Fit | 3.0 | Has 401(k) match | Confirm contribution priorities |
| Contribution System | 3.5 | Will automate | Set escalation schedule |
| Behavior & Process | 3.0 | Avoids complexity | Define review cadence and “no panic” rules |

3) **ACCOUNT & PORTFOLIO RECOMMENDATION (GENERIC)**
- Approach: simple diversified fund mix or target-date fund (choose the simplest viable)
- Contributions: $300/month auto; increase by $25–$50 every quarter
- Review: quarterly check; rebalance only if drift exceeds preset threshold

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Manual investing → inconsistent → autopay contributions
- Gap 2: Portfolio ambiguity → procrastination → pick one approach now
- Gap 3: Panic risk → no rules → write “what I do in a downturn”
- Gap 4: No escalation → stagnation → scheduled increases
- Gap 5: Too much checking → anxiety → limit review cadence

5) **12-MONTH PLAN**
- Months 1–3: set contributions, choose approach, write policy, set review reminders
- Months 4–12: run contributions, quarterly review, adjust contribution rate with income changes

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Contribution consistency: 0% → 100% monthly
- Contribution amount: $300 → $450/month by month 12
- Fees: keep low and transparent
- Behavior: zero reactive trades

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Automate contributions** — consistency beats timing.
2) **Keep it simple** — complexity usually increases mistakes.
3) **Separate short- and long-term money** — don’t invest emergency funds.
4) **Control fees** — costs compound too.
5) **Diversify intentionally** — avoid concentration without a reason.
6) **Write your rules** — define what you do in downturns.
7) **Review on a schedule** — constant checking increases anxiety.
8) **Increase contributions over time** — the system should grow with you.
