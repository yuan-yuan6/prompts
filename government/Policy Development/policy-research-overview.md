# Policy Research Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
Navigate the comprehensive policy research framework by understanding each phase, selecting the appropriate prompt for your current needs, and following a systematic approach to evidence-based policy development.

## Quick Start

**Want to develop evidence-based policy?** Here's how to navigate the framework:

### When to Use This Overview
- Starting a new policy development project
- Need systematic approach to policy research
- Evaluating policy alternatives
- Planning policy implementation
- Unsure which phase you're in

### Quick Module Selection
```
Your Policy Development Stage → Recommended Module:

1. Research the problem and gather evidence
   → policy-research-analysis.md (Literature review, data analysis, case studies, 1-2 weeks)

2. Assess potential impacts of policy options
   → policy-impact-assessment.md (Economic, social, environmental impacts, 3-5 days)

3. Develop and evaluate policy alternatives
   → policy-options-development.md (Design options, compare trade-offs, 1-2 weeks)

4. Plan how to implement chosen policy
   → policy-implementation-planning.md (Roadmap, resources, stakeholders, 1 week)
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Research & analyze** - Use policy-research-analysis.md to build evidence base
2. **Assess impacts** - Use policy-impact-assessment.md to understand consequences
3. **Develop options** - Use policy-options-development.md to create alternatives and recommend best path

**Time to complete**: 3-6 weeks for complete policy development process

**Pro tip**: Always start with research & analysis phase. Don't skip impact assessment - unintended consequences often emerge there.

## Policy Research Framework

The policy research process is divided into four integrated phases, each with a dedicated prompt:

### 1. Research & Analysis Phase
**Prompt:** `policy-research-analysis.md`

**Use when you need to:**

- Gather evidence from multiple sources
- Perform comparative jurisdictional analysis
- Evaluate research methodology and evidence quality
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights

**Key outputs:**
- Evidence base from literature, data, and case studies
- Comparative analysis of policy approaches
- Assessment of evidence quality and reliability
- Key findings and research gaps
- Foundation for policy development

### 2. Impact Assessment Phase
**Prompt:** `policy-impact-assessment.md`

**Use when you need to:**
- Evaluate economic, social, and environmental impacts
- Assess distributional effects across populations
- Analyze stakeholder impacts
- Conduct multi-criteria impact analysis
- Quantify costs and benefits

**Key outputs:**
- Economic impact analysis (fiscal, market, GDP)
- Social impact assessment (equity, access, quality of life)
- Environmental impact evaluation (emissions, resources, sustainability)
- Stakeholder impact mapping
- Multi-criteria evaluation framework

### 3. Options Development Phase
**Prompt:** `policy-options-development.md`

**Use when you need to:**
- Develop multiple policy alternatives
- Compare options through cost-benefit analysis
- Assess implementation risks and feasibility
- Engage stakeholders on options
- Make evidence-based recommendations

**Key outputs:**
- 3-5 well-designed policy alternatives
- Comparative cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment for each option
- Stakeholder consultation findings
- Recommended policy approach with rationale

### 4. Implementation Planning Phase
**Prompt:** `policy-implementation-planning.md`

**Use when you need to:**
- Develop detailed implementation roadmaps
- Plan regulatory and legislative requirements
- Allocate resources and budget
- Design monitoring and evaluation systems
- Establish governance and accountability

**Key outputs:**
- Phased implementation timeline
- Resource requirements and budget
- Regulatory framework
- Monitoring and evaluation plan
- Risk management strategy
- Stakeholder engagement plan

## How to Use This Framework

### Sequential Approach
For comprehensive policy development, follow the phases in order:

```
1. Research & Analysis
   ↓
2. Impact Assessment
   ↓
3. Options Development
   ↓
4. Implementation Planning
```

**Example workflow:**
1. Start with **policy-research-analysis.md** to gather evidence on climate policy options
2. Use **policy-impact-assessment.md** to evaluate economic, social, and environmental impacts
3. Apply **policy-options-development.md** to compare carbon tax, cap-and-trade, and hybrid approaches
4. Finalize with **policy-implementation-planning.md** to create a detailed rollout plan

### Targeted Approach
For specific tasks, jump directly to the relevant phase:

**Scenario 1:** You already have research and need to assess impacts
→ Use **policy-impact-assessment.md**

**Scenario 2:** You have a draft policy and need an implementation plan
→ Use **policy-implementation-planning.md**

**Scenario 3:** Stakeholders are debating alternatives
→ Use **policy-options-development.md**

**Scenario 4:** You need evidence to support a policy position
→ Use **policy-research-analysis.md**

### Iterative Approach
Policy development is often iterative. You may cycle through phases:

```
Research → Impact Assessment → Options Development
                                        ↓
                                   Need more evidence?
                                        ↓
                                   Return to Research
```

## Integration Points

### From Research to Impact Assessment
**Handoff:** Research findings inform baseline conditions and analytical assumptions for impact assessment.

**Key questions:**
- What does the evidence tell us about current conditions?
- What are the magnitudes of problems we're addressing?
- What do case studies suggest about potential impacts?

### From Impact Assessment to Options Development
**Handoff:** Impact analysis reveals which dimensions matter most and informs option design.

**Key questions:**
- Which impacts are most significant?
- Who are the key stakeholders to engage?
- What trade-offs need to be balanced?

### From Options Development to Implementation Planning
**Handoff:** Selected option becomes the basis for detailed implementation design.

**Key questions:**
- What are the specific features of the recommended approach?
- What risks need mitigation in implementation?
- What resources and timeline are required?

- Maintain consistency in terminology and frameworks across phases

**Phase-specific:**
- **Research:** Focus on evidence quality over quantity
- **Impact Assessment:** Be transparent about uncertainties
- **Options Development:** Design genuine alternatives, not minor variations
- **Implementation Planning:** Plan for adaptation and learning
