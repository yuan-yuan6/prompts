# Vulnerability Management Program

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for establishing enterprise vulnerability management program including asset discovery, vulnerability scanning, risk-based prioritization, remediation workflows, and metrics tracking.

## Quick Start

**Need to build a vulnerability management program?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Design vulnerability management program for 5000 endpoints, 200 servers, 50 web applications covering asset discovery, weekly scanning, risk-based prioritization, SLA-driven remediation, and executive dashboarding. Integrate with Tenable, Qualys, and JIRA for ticket management.
```

### When to Use This
- Establishing new vulnerability management program
- Improving existing vuln management processes
- Meeting compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, NIST)
- Reducing organizational risk exposure
- Implementing continuous security monitoring

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Discover & Scan** - Asset inventory, vulnerability scanning (Ongoing)
2. **Prioritize & Assign** - Risk-based prioritization, owner assignment (Weekly)
3. **Remediate & Validate** - Apply fixes, re-scan verification (Per SLA)

**Time to complete**: Ongoing program, initial setup 4-8 weeks

## Template

```markdown
I need to design a comprehensive vulnerability management program. Please provide detailed program design and implementation guidance.

## ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT

### Asset Inventory
- Endpoints: [WINDOWS_MAC_LINUX_COUNT]
- Servers: [PHYSICAL_VIRTUAL_CLOUD_COUNT]
- Network devices: [FIREWALLS_SWITCHES_ROUTERS]
- Applications: [WEB_MOBILE_DESKTOP_COUNT]
- Databases: [TYPES_AND_COUNT]
- Cloud resources: [AWS_AZURE_GCP_ASSETS]
- IoT/OT devices: [TYPES_AND_COUNT]

### Current State
- Existing tools: [SCANNERS_TOOLS_PLATFORMS]
- Scan frequency: [DAILY_WEEKLY_MONTHLY_AD_HOC]
- Coverage: [PERCENTAGE_OF_ASSETS]
- Remediation SLAs: [CRITICAL_HIGH_MEDIUM_LOW]
- Integration: [TICKETING_SIEM_CMDB]

### Requirements
- Compliance: [PCI_DSS_NIST_CSF_ISO27001_SOC2]
- Risk tolerance: [LOW_MEDIUM_HIGH]
- Remediation timeline: [SLA_REQUIREMENTS]
- Reporting needs: [EXECUTIVE_OPERATIONAL_COMPLIANCE]
- Budget constraints: [TOOLS_RESOURCES_PRIORITIES]

## PROGRAM COMPONENTS

### 1. Asset Discovery & Inventory
**Discovery Methods:**
- Active scanning (Nmap, network scanners)
- Passive monitoring (network traffic analysis)
- Agent-based discovery
- Cloud API integration
- CMDB integration
- Directory services (AD, LDAP)

**Asset Classification:**
- Criticality rating (Tier 1/2/3)
- Data classification
- Business function
- Owner assignment
- Environment (prod/dev/test)
- Compliance scope

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
**Scanning Strategy:**
- Authenticated vs unauthenticated scans
- Scan frequency by asset criticality
- Scan windows and scheduling
- Credentialed access management
- Network segmentation considerations
- Performance impact mitigation

**Scanning Tools:**
- Network scanners: Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7
- Web app scanners: Burp Suite, Acunetix, AppScan
- Container scanners: Aqua, Twistlock, Snyk
- Cloud scanners: AWS Inspector, Azure Defender
- Code scanners: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment
**Severity Rating:**
- CVSS base score
- Exploitability factors
- Asset criticality
- Threat intelligence
- Environmental factors
- Compensating controls

**Risk Prioritization:**
- Critical: Actively exploited, high impact
- High: Exploitable, significant impact
- Medium: Moderate exploitability and impact
- Low: Difficult to exploit, minimal impact

**False Positive Management:**
- Validation process
- Exception handling
- Whitelisting procedures
- Documentation requirements

### 4. Remediation Workflow
**SLA Framework:**
- Critical: 24-48 hours
- High: 7-14 days
- Medium: 30 days
- Low: 90 days

**Remediation Methods:**
- Patching (OS, applications, firmware)
- Configuration changes
- Compensating controls
- Virtual patching (WAF rules)
- Decommissioning vulnerable assets
- Network segmentation

**Workflow Process:**
1. Vulnerability identified and validated
2. Ticket created and assigned to owner
3. Risk acceptance or remediation planned
4. Change management approval (if needed)
5. Remediation implemented
6. Verification scan performed
7. Ticket closed with documentation

### 5. Patch Management Integration
**Patch Strategy:**
- Emergency patching process
- Regular patch cycles
- Testing requirements
- Rollback procedures
- Change windows
- Patch deployment tools

**Patch Prioritization:**
- Security patches first
- Critical systems priority
- Testing in non-prod first
- Phased rollouts
- Monitoring post-deployment

### 6. Exception Management
**Risk Acceptance Process:**
- Business justification required
- Compensating controls identified
- Executive approval
- Time-bound exceptions
- Regular review cycle
- Documentation requirements

**Acceptable Reasons:**
- Technical limitations
- Business impact of remediation
- Compensating controls in place
- Pending system retirement
- Vendor support unavailable

### 7. Metrics & Reporting
**Key Metrics:**
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
- Vulnerability density (vulns per asset)
- SLA compliance rate
- Remediation rate by severity
- Open vulnerability aging
- Repeat vulnerabilities
- Coverage percentage

**Reporting:**
- Executive dashboard (risk trends, KPIs)
- Operational reports (open vulns, SLA status)
- Compliance reports (PCI, NIST, ISO)
- Team scorecards (remediation performance)
- Trend analysis (improving/degrading)

### 8. Tool Integration
**Integrations:**
- Ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)
- SIEM platforms (Splunk, Sentinel)
- CMDB/Asset management
- SOAR for automation
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Patch management tools
- Configuration management (Ansible, Puppet)

## PROGRAM MATURITY LEVELS

- **Automate Everything Possible** - Reduce manual effort
- **Risk-Based Prioritization** - Not all vulnerabilities are equal
- **Clear SLAs and Accountability** - Define expectations
- **Integrate with Existing Tools** - Don't create silos
- **Measure and Report** - Track progress and trends
- **Continuous Improvement** - Evolve the program
