# Executive Communication & Leadership Briefings Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver **executive-grade communication**—concise, decision-oriented, evidence-backed, and contextually aware. Use this to diagnose gaps in message discipline, briefing structure, and stakeholder alignment.

## Template

Conduct an executive communication & leadership briefings readiness assessment for {EXEC_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (decision velocity, message clarity, executive feedback, meeting efficiency).

**1) MESSAGE CLARITY & FRAMING**
- The "ask" or decision is stated upfront (not buried)
- Key message answers: what, so what, now what
- Assumptions and uncertainties are stated explicitly
- Jargon is eliminated; language is precise and accessible

**2) DECISION-READINESS & OPTIONS**
- Recommendation is clear with supporting rationale
- Options are presented with tradeoffs, costs, and risks
- Decision criteria align to strategic priorities
- Timeframe and dependencies are explicit

**3) DATA, EVIDENCE & INSIGHT**
- Claims are backed by credible data and cited sources
- Trends, drivers, and variance are explained (not just reported)
- Visuals are executive-appropriate (few charts, high signal, readable)
- Context is provided (benchmarks, history, forecast)

**4) BREVITY & STRUCTURE**
- Pre-read materials are concise (1-2 pages executive summary)
- Structure follows pyramid principle (conclusion first, then support)
- Appendices contain detail without cluttering the narrative
- Meeting time is respected with clear agenda and timeboxes

**5) STAKEHOLDER AWARENESS & ALIGNMENT**
- Key stakeholders are consulted before the briefing
- Political dynamics and concerns are anticipated
- Cross-functional impacts are addressed
- Follow-up commitments and owners are clear

**6) DELIVERY & Q&A READINESS**
- Presenter is credible, concise, and confident
- Anticipated questions have crisp, rehearsed responses
- Meeting facilitation plan exists (who speaks, when, how long)
- Follow-up protocol is defined (next steps, decisions documented)

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, decision velocity assessment, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **BRIEFING AUDIT**
- Recent briefings reviewed (3–5 examples): topic, outcome, strengths, gaps
- Common failure modes (unclear asks, too much detail, poor structure)

4) **EXECUTIVE PREFERENCE MAP**
- For top 3 exec stakeholders: communication style, preferred format, decision-making approach

5) **TEMPLATE & PLAYBOOK**
- Standard executive brief template (1-pager with ask, context, options, recommendation)
- Q&A prep checklist and delivery best practices

6) **30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- Actions to improve message discipline, briefing structure, and stakeholder alignment
- Metrics (decision velocity, exec satisfaction, rework rate)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (unclear asks, verbose, low trust, slow decisions)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic structure, gaps in clarity and insight)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable format, solid execution, inconsistent alignment)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (concise, decision-ready, high trust, fast decisions)
- 5.0: Optimized (anticipates needs, builds consensus, accelerates strategy)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {EXEC_CONTEXT}: Executive audience, communication cadence, decision types, tooling
- {OBJECTIVES}: Decision velocity, alignment, trust, efficiency goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Time, access, political dynamics, confidentiality, format limits

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {EXEC_CONTEXT}: CFO and COO briefings for quarterly planning. Frequency: monthly 30-min sessions. Decisions: budget approvals, vendor selections, org changes. Format: slide deck + 1-pager.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Reduce decision time from 2 weeks to 3 days, improve exec satisfaction from 6/10 to 8/10, eliminate rework on 50% of briefings.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Execs read materials 10 minutes before meeting; political sensitivity on headcount; confidential financial data limits distribution.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.4 (Developing)
- Decision velocity: avg 10 days (target 3); rework rate 45%
- Top improvements: (1) state the ask upfront, (2) reduce slides from 15 to 5, (3) pre-align with CFO before formal briefing

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Message Clarity & Framing: 2/5 — asks buried on slide 10; jargon prevalent
- Decision-Readiness & Options: 3/5 — options presented but tradeoffs unclear
- Data, Evidence & Insight: 3/5 — data present but drivers not explained
- Brevity & Structure: 2/5 — 15 slides; no exec summary; appendices missing
- Stakeholder Awareness: 2/5 — CFO surprised by headcount impact twice
- Delivery & Q&A: 3/5 — presenter knowledgeable but verbose; Q&A unprepared

**3) BRIEFING AUDIT**
- Briefing 1 (vendor selection): outcome = delayed 2 weeks; gap = no cost comparison, unclear ROI
- Briefing 2 (headcount approval): outcome = denied; gap = CFO not pre-briefed, political concern missed
- Briefing 3 (budget variance): outcome = approved after rework; gap = variance drivers not explained
- Common failure modes: ask unclear (3/3 briefings), too much detail (2/3), missing stakeholder pre-alignment (2/3)

**4) EXECUTIVE PREFERENCE MAP**
- CFO: prefers 1-page memo with financial impact upfront; dislikes slide decks; responds to ROI framing
- COO: prefers visuals (process flows, dashboards); asks "what's the risk?"; wants implementation timeline
- CEO (occasional): wants 3 bullets max; decision criteria explicit; no surprises

**5) TEMPLATE & PLAYBOOK**
- Standard 1-pager template:
  - Decision needed (1 sentence)
  - Context (2-3 bullets: what changed, why now, constraints)
  - Options (table: option, pros, cons, cost, risk)
  - Recommendation (1 sentence + rationale)
  - Next steps (owner, timeline, dependencies)
- Q&A prep checklist: anticipate "why now?", "what's the cost?", "what's the risk?", "who else agrees?"
- Delivery best practices: start with the ask, timebox to 10 min presentation + 20 min Q&A, follow up with decision doc same day

**6) 30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- 30 days: deploy 1-pager template; train team on pyramid principle; pre-brief CFO 2 days before formal session
- 60 days: conduct dry runs for complex briefings; reduce avg slide count from 15 to 5; track decision velocity
- 90 days: implement exec feedback survey; analyze rework themes; refine Q&A prep process
- Metrics: decision time (goal 3 days), exec satisfaction (goal 8/10), rework rate (goal <20%)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) State the decision or ask in the first sentence—never bury the lead.
2) Use the pyramid principle: conclusion first, then supporting arguments.
3) Limit slides to 5 or use a 1-page memo; push detail to appendices.
4) Show tradeoffs explicitly—execs need to understand what they're giving up.
5) Pre-align with key stakeholders before the formal briefing to avoid surprises.
6) Anticipate "why now?" and "what's the risk?" in every briefing.
7) Use crisp visuals that executives can read in 5 seconds (no dense tables).
8) Document decisions and next steps same-day; follow up promptly on commitments.
