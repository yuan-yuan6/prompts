# Music & Audio Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive music and audio content including lyrics, compositions, and sound design for various media formats and musical applications across genres and styles.

## Quick Music Audio Prompt

Create [audio type: song/score/sound design] for [project name] in [primary genre] with [secondary genre] influences. Compose in [key] at [tempo] BPM, structure as [song form: verse-chorus/through-composed], write lyrics about [theme] with [emotional tone], arrange for [instruments/production style], target [audience] for [platform/use case], and deliver within [timeline]. Include [hook element] and [production notes].

## Quick Start

**Create Your First Song in 30 Minutes**

1. **Set the Vibe** (2 min): Choose genre, tempo, and emotional goal
2. **Hook First** (10 min): Write your catchiest chorus line and melody
3. **Build Around It** (15 min): Add one verse that leads to your hook
4. **Record a Demo** (3 min): Capture it on your phone while it's fresh

**Starter Formula**: [Verse 1 + Chorus + Verse 2 + Chorus + Bridge + Final Chorus]

**Try This**: Hum your melody, then add words. It's faster than writing lyrics first!

**Pro Move**: Fill in `[SONG_TITLE]`, `[KEY_SIGNATURE]`, and `[TEMPO]` to lock in your foundation.
