# Market Analysis Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to run a repeatable market analysis capability that produces trusted insights for strategy, investment decisions, and go-to-market choices.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess market analysis readiness for [ORGANIZATION] competing in [MARKET] within [INDUSTRY] and [GEOGRAPHY]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Market data & sources, (2) Research methods & rigor, (3) Competitive intelligence & monitoring, (4) Insights-to-action process, (5) Talent & tooling, (6) Governance, ethics & compliance. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 60–90 day plan to improve output quality and decision impact.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Market Data & Sources
- 1 — Initial: Sources are ad-hoc; TAM/SAM/SOM inputs are inconsistent; limited traceability to original data.
- 3 — Defined: Standard source list; clear assumptions; triangulation across sources; basic source credibility rubric.
- 5 — Optimized: Source governance; reusable datasets; consistent segmentation taxonomy; continuous refresh where needed.

### 2) Research Methods & Rigor
- 1 — Initial: Methods vary by analyst; limited sensitivity analysis; outputs depend heavily on judgment without checks.
- 3 — Defined: Method playbook; documented sizing approaches; clear confidence levels and assumptions.
- 5 — Optimized: Repeatable research design; quantified uncertainty; peer review and validation routinely applied.

### 3) Competitive Intelligence & Monitoring
- 1 — Initial: Competitive profiles are one-off; updates happen only during planning cycles.
- 3 — Defined: Competitor profile template; monitoring cadence; structured tracking of launches, pricing, partnerships.
- 5 — Optimized: Signals-based monitoring; defined triggers; institutional knowledge base; rapid briefings for decision-makers.

### 4) Insights-to-Action Process
- 1 — Initial: Reports exist but do not drive decisions; recommendations are vague or not tied to owners.
- 3 — Defined: Insights mapped to strategic questions; recommendations include actions, owners, and timelines.
- 5 — Optimized: Decisions and outcomes are tracked; feedback improves future research; clear linkage to OKRs and investment gates.

### 5) Talent & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Limited research skill coverage; tools are inconsistent; analysis is manual and slow.
- 3 — Defined: Core skill set covered; standard tools/templates; reasonable cycle times and handoffs.
- 5 — Optimized: Strong analytical depth; enabling tools and automation; scalable operating model with clear service levels.

### 6) Governance, Ethics & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Unclear rules for data use, sourcing, and competitive intelligence; IP/privacy risks unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Written guidance and approvals for research and CI; citation standards; basic compliance review.
- 5 — Optimized: Clear policies, training, and auditability; safe handling of sensitive sources; consistent compliance and risk management.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with short evidence notes
- Top gaps and risks (quality, bias, traceability, compliance)
- Source and method standards (what to use, how to cite, how to validate)
- 60–90 day improvement plan
- Success metrics (cycle time, reuse rate, decision adoption, forecast accuracy where applicable)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [MARKET]: Market definition (product/service scope)
- [GEOGRAPHY]: Geographic scope
- [CUSTOMER_SEGMENTS]: Segment taxonomy used for analysis
- [COMPETITOR_SET]: Core competitor list
- [STRATEGIC_QUESTIONS]: Decisions the analysis must inform

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: B2B SaaS provider assessing entry into a new vertical
- Scores (1–5): Data & Sources 2; Methods 3; Competitive Monitoring 2; Insights-to-Action 2; Talent & Tooling 3; Governance 2
- Top gaps: Unclear market definition, weak source traceability, no monitoring triggers, recommendations not tied to owners
- 60–90 day priorities: Define market taxonomy; establish source rubric + citation standard; create competitor monitoring cadence; implement insight-to-action template
