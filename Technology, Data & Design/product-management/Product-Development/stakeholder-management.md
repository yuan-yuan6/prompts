# Stakeholder Management & Communication Template

## Purpose
Build effective stakeholder relationships, align diverse groups on product vision and priorities, communicate product decisions clearly, and navigate competing interests to drive successful product outcomes.

## Quick Start

**Need stakeholder alignment quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Stakeholders: CEO, Sales VP, 3 eng teams, 2 key customers
Goal: Align on Q2 roadmap priorities
Approach:
1. Map interests: CEO→revenue, Sales→pipeline, Eng→tech debt, Customers→features
2. Gather input: 1:1s with each stakeholder
3. Propose roadmap: Balance all interests, show tradeoffs
4. Present: "Here's what we're doing, why, and what we're NOT doing"
5. Get buy-in: Address concerns, commit to regular updates
Output: Approved roadmap, bi-weekly stakeholder updates
```

### When to Use This
- Starting as new PM on a product or team
- Major strategic decisions requiring broad alignment
- Conflicting stakeholder priorities need resolution
- Product roadmap planning and prioritization
- Crisis management or significant product issues

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Map stakeholders** - Identify who matters, their interests, influence (1 day)
2. **Build relationships** - Regular 1:1s, understand their goals (ongoing)
3. **Gather input** - Proactively seek feedback before decisions (1 week)
4. **Communicate decisions** - Explain rationale, show you heard them (1 day)
5. **Maintain alignment** - Regular updates, transparency (ongoing)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: New PM Building Stakeholder Relationships
```
Situation: New PM joining to lead struggling product
Stakeholders: CEO (skeptical), Eng team (demoralized), Sales (frustrated), 3 at-risk customers
First 30 Days:
- Week 1: Listen tour - 1:1s with all stakeholders, no commitments
- Week 2: Synthesize feedback, identify quick wins
- Week 3: Present assessment and 90-day plan
- Week 4: Execute quick wins, establish regular update cadence
Goal: Rebuild trust, establish credibility, align on path forward
```

### Example 2: Navigating Conflicting Roadmap Priorities
```
Conflict: Sales wants Feature X for deals, Engineering wants to pay tech debt
Stakeholders: VP Sales, CTO, CEO (decision maker)
Approach:
1. Quantify sales opportunity: $2M pipeline blocked

- Hour 4: CEO call with customer - acknowledge concern, explain roadmap
- Week 1: Provide workaround, commit to timeline
- Month 1: Beta access to feature
- Month 2: Feature GA, customer becomes reference
```

## Best Practices

### Relationship Building

2. **Regular cadence** - Predictable communication, not just when you need something
3. **Understand motivations** - Know what drives each stakeholder
4. **Provide value** - Help them succeed, not just ask for things
5. **Be authentic** - Genuine relationships beat transactional ones

### Communication
1. **Tailor to audience** - Execs want summary, eng wants details
2. **Lead with why** - Context before asks
3. **Bad news early** - Don't let stakeholders be surprised
4. **Show you listened** - Reference their input in decisions
5. **Close the loop** - Always explain what you did with their feedback

### Decision-Making
1. **Seek input early** - Before decisions are made, not after
2. **Be transparent** - Share rationale and tradeoffs
3. **Data-driven** - Back up recommendations with evidence
4. **Acknowledge dissent** - Show you heard opposing views
5. **Move on** - Once decided, commit and execute

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Listen first** - Understand all perspectives before proposing solution
2. **Focus on interests** - Not positions
3. **Find win-wins** - Creative solutions that address multiple needs
4. **Make tradeoffs explicit** - Be clear about what you're prioritizing
5. **Escalate appropriately** - Know when you need help

### Trust Building
1. **Do what you say** - Deliver on commitments
2. **Admit mistakes** - Own failures and learn from them
3. **Give credit** - Recognize others' contributions
4. **Maintain confidence** - Respect confidential information
5. **Be consistent** - Predictable and reliable

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Telling, not listening** - Pushing your agenda without understanding theirs
✅ Instead: Seek to understand before seeking to be understood

❌ **Surprises** - Stakeholders finding out from others or too late
✅ Instead: Proactive communication, especially for bad news

❌ **One-size-fits-all communication** - Same message/format for everyone
✅ Instead: Tailor communication to stakeholder preferences and needs

❌ **Avoiding conflict** - Hoping disagreements resolve themselves
✅ Instead: Address conflicts directly with data and facilitation

❌ **Over-promising** - Saying yes to everything to please people
✅ Instead: Set realistic expectations and deliver consistently

❌ **Stakeholder whiplash** - Changing direction based on latest conversation
