## AUDIO PROCESSING GUIDE

### Essential Processing Chain
1. **Noise Reduction**
   - Remove constant background noise
   - Don't overprocess (sounds robotic)
   - Sample quiet section for profile

2. **EQ (Equalization)**
   - High-pass filter at 80-100Hz (remove rumble)
   - Boost around 3-5kHz for clarity
   - Reduce around 200-300Hz if muddy
   - Don't overboost

3. **Compression**
   - Ratio: 3:1 to 5:1
   - Threshold: -20dB to -15dB
   - Attack: Medium (10-30ms)
   - Release: Medium (100-300ms)
   - Aim for 3-6dB of gain reduction

4. **Limiting**
   - Set ceiling at -1dB to -0.5dB
   - Prevent clipping and distortion
   - Ensure consistent maximum volume

5. **Normalization**
   - Peak normalization to -1dB
   - Or loudness normalization to -16 LUFS
   - Ensures consistent volume across episodes

### File Export Settings
**Format**: MP3 (best compatibility)
**Bitrate**: 128 kbps (good quality, smaller file) or 192 kbps (better quality)
**Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
**Channels**: Mono or Stereo
**ID3 Tags**: Complete metadata

- `[TECHNICAL_SPECS]`: Equipment budget
- `[FORMAT_TYPE]`: Episode format
- `[PLATFORM_PREFERENCES]`: Distribution platforms

## Best Practices

1. **Record in highest quality** - Easy to compress down, can't improve poor recording
2. **Monitor levels constantly** - Peak around -12dB to -6dB for safety
3. **Use headphones while recording** - Catch issues in real-time
4. **Save frequently and backup** - Protect your work
5. **Edit with fresh ears** - Take breaks during long editing sessions
6. **Less is more with processing** - Don't over-edit or over-process
7. **Maintain consistency** - Same levels, quality across episodes
8. **Test on different devices** - Car, phone, laptop, earbuds
9. **Create templates** - Save time with processing chains and workflows
10. **Keep learning** - Audio engineering improves with practice

## Tips for Success

- Invest in a good microphone before anything else
