# Influencer Marketing Campaign Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design, contract, execute, and measure influencer campaigns with compliant operations and reliable ROI.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess influencer marketing readiness for [BRAND] targeting [AUDIENCE] with budget [BUDGET] and goal [CONVERSIONS_TARGET] conversions. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Objective & audience fit, (2) Creator selection & vetting, (3) Briefing & content approvals, (4) Contracting & compliance, (5) Tracking & measurement, (6) Optimization & scaling. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objective & Audience Fit
- 1 — Initial: Goals are vague; influencer channel fit is unproven.
- 3 — Defined: Clear objective, target audience, and offer; success criteria defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Channel mix and creator tiers are tuned by performance and repeatable.

### 2) Creator Selection & Vetting
- 1 — Initial: Creators selected by follower count; limited vetting for brand fit.
- 3 — Defined: Vetting criteria (audience match, engagement quality, brand fit) documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Selection uses performance data; fraud checks and benchmarks are standard.

### 3) Briefing & Content Approvals
- 1 — Initial: Briefs are inconsistent; review cycles cause delays and rework.
- 3 — Defined: Standard brief, review steps, and timelines; guidance on do/don’t.
- 5 — Optimized: Briefs enable creator authenticity while maintaining message consistency.

### 4) Contracting & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Contracts are ad-hoc; disclosure rules inconsistently applied.
- 3 — Defined: Standard contract terms; disclosure and usage rights are clear.
- 5 — Optimized: Compliance is automated and audited; rights management is reliable.

### 5) Tracking & Measurement
- 1 — Initial: Tracking is weak; attribution is unclear; reporting inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: UTMs/codes/links standardized; KPI dashboard; reporting cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement ties to outcomes; incrementality and lift methods improve confidence.

### 6) Optimization & Scaling
- 1 — Initial: No iteration loop; results don’t inform next campaigns.
- 3 — Defined: Tests on creatives/offers; learnings captured; scaling plan exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Program scales via creator tiers and playbooks; ROI improves predictably.

## Deliverables
- Influencer campaign readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Creator vetting criteria and shortlisting process
- Standard influencer brief and approval workflow
- Contracting/compliance checklist and disclosure rules
- Tracking plan (UTMs/codes) and reporting dashboard spec

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND]: Brand or product
- [AUDIENCE]: Target audience/segment
- [BUDGET]: Budget
- [CONVERSIONS_TARGET]: Target conversions
- [PLATFORMS]: TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch
- [KPI_SET]: Reach, engagement, CAC, conversions, ROAS

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: DTC skincare launching a new product line
