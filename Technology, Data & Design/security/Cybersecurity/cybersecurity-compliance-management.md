## Template

Establish compliance program for {REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK} covering {COMPLIANCE_SCOPE} achieving {COMPLIANCE_OBJECTIVES} with {TIMELINE} timeline and {BUDGET} budget.

**REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ASSESSMENT**

Identify applicable compliance requirements. Framework selection: primary framework (GDPR for EU data processing, HIPAA for US healthcare PHI, SOC 2 for service organization controls, PCI-DSS for payment card data, ISO 27001 for information security management), supporting frameworks (NIST Privacy Framework complements GDPR, NIST CSF aligns with SOC 2, CIS Controls support ISO 27001, industry-specific—FINRA for financial services, NERC CIP for energy sector). Scope definition: in-scope systems (production environments, customer-facing applications, data processing systems, cloud infrastructure), in-scope data types (PII for GDPR/CCPA, PHI for HIPAA, cardholder data for PCI-DSS, all information assets for ISO 27001), geographic jurisdictions (EU and EEA for GDPR, California for CCPA, states with breach notification laws, international data transfers).

Gap assessment: current state analysis (document existing controls—what security measures already in place?, identify documentation gaps—policies missing or outdated?, assess technology compliance—systems meet technical requirements?), target state requirements (framework-specific requirements—GDPR Article 32 security measures, HIPAA Security Rule safeguards, SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, control objectives mapped to business processes), gap identification (control gaps—required controls not implemented, policy gaps—documentation missing or insufficient, process gaps—procedures not defined or followed, technical gaps—system configurations not compliant). Roadmap development: prioritization by risk and compliance impact (critical gaps blocking compliance certification, high-priority gaps with regulatory penalties, quick wins—easy implementations with high compliance value), phased approach (Phase 1: critical controls and documentation 0-6 months, Phase 2: comprehensive implementation 6-12 months, Phase 3: optimization and continuous improvement 12-18 months).

**POLICY AND GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK**

Establish compliance governance structure. Governance committee: executive steering committee (CISO, CFO, General Counsel, business unit leaders, meet quarterly for strategic compliance decisions, approve policies and budgets, review compliance metrics and audit results), compliance working group (compliance officer/DPO as chair, IT security, legal, HR, privacy leads, meet monthly for operational compliance management, coordinate control implementation, prepare for audits), role assignments (Data Protection Officer for GDPR—independent role, reports to board, HIPAA Security Officer, PCI-DSS Qualified Security Assessor liaison, ISO 27001 Information Security Manager).

Policy framework hierarchy: policies (high-level statements of intent and objectives—Information Security Policy, Data Protection and Privacy Policy, board-approved, reviewed annually), standards (mandatory technical requirements—encryption standards AES-256 minimum, password complexity requirements 12+ characters, applies to all systems and users), procedures (step-by-step how-to instructions—incident response procedures, access provisioning procedures, role-specific, updated as processes change), guidelines (recommendations and best practices—secure coding guidelines, vendor assessment guidelines, non-mandatory but encouraged).

Policy lifecycle management: policy development (identify need based on regulatory requirement or risk, draft using templates aligned to framework, legal and security review for accuracy and enforceability, stakeholder consultation—IT operations, business units, executive approval—board for core policies, CISO for supporting), policy communication (all-hands announcement for major policies, targeted training for affected groups, intranet publication with easy access, acknowledgment required—track in LMS or HR system), policy training (annual security awareness for all employees—phishing, acceptable use, data protection, role-specific training—developers get secure coding, support gets data handling, new hire onboarding includes policy overview), policy maintenance (annual review cycle minimum, triggered review for regulatory changes—GDPR updates, new HIPAA guidance, version control with change tracking, archive superseded versions for audit trail).

**CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING**

Deploy technical and administrative controls. Control framework mapping: map business processes to control requirements (GDPR Article 32—security of processing maps to encryption, access control, incident response, SOC 2 CC6—logical access maps to authentication, authorization, least privilege, PCI-DSS Requirement 8—identify and authenticate access maps to unique IDs, strong passwords, MFA), control objectives defined (what security outcome should control achieve?, example: access control prevents unauthorized data access), control activities specified (specific actions implementing control—role-based access, quarterly access reviews, MFA enforcement).

Control categories and types: administrative controls (policies, procedures, training, background checks, access approval workflows), technical controls (encryption, firewalls, MFA, logging and monitoring, DLP), physical controls (badge access, CCTV, secure disposal, visitor management), preventive controls (stop security events before occurrence—firewall blocks malicious traffic, access control prevents unauthorized access), detective controls (identify security events after occurrence—SIEM detects anomalies, log analysis finds unauthorized access), corrective controls (remediate security events—incident response, patch management, backup restoration).

Control implementation approach: prioritize by compliance criticality (must-have controls for certification—encryption for PCI-DSS Requirement 3, audit logging for SOC 2 CC7, implement first), design controls for effectiveness and efficiency (automated controls scale better than manual—automatic account lockout vs manual review, controls should not impede business unnecessarily), document control design (control description, responsible party, frequency of operation—continuous, daily, quarterly, evidence generated—logs, screenshots, reports), implement with change management (test in non-production, user training where applicable, rollout plan with rollback procedures), validate implementation (control testing confirms control works as designed, evidence collection for audit, remediate deficiencies before relying on control).

Control testing methodology: test design effectiveness (does control design meet objective?, review control documentation, walkthroughs with control owners, one-time testing during implementation), test operating effectiveness (does control operate consistently over time?, sample testing—select representative samples from period, reperformance—independently execute control procedures, observation—watch control execution, inquiry—interview control performers), testing frequency (critical controls tested quarterly, high-risk annually, routine controls based on risk and change frequency), testing documentation (test plan with scope and procedures, test results with evidence—screenshots, logs, reports, deficiencies noted with severity rating and remediation plan).

**RISK MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION**

Connect compliance to risk management. Risk assessment for compliance: identify compliance risks (regulatory penalties—GDPR fines up to €20M or 4% revenue, HIPAA penalties $50K-$1.5M per violation, reputation damage from compliance failures, business disruption from audit findings), assess likelihood and impact (likelihood: how probable is non-compliance given current controls?, impact: financial penalties + reputation damage + customer loss, quantify where possible using FAIR methodology), risk rating and prioritization (critical risks require immediate action—block compliance certification, high risks addressed in current period, medium and low risks monitored and planned).

Risk treatment strategies: mitigate risk through control implementation (strongest approach—implement technical and administrative controls to reduce likelihood or impact, example: encryption mitigates data breach risk), transfer risk through insurance or contracts (cyber insurance covers some financial impact, vendor contracts shift compliance responsibility where appropriate, residual risk remains—insurance doesn't prevent compliance failure), accept risk with management approval (document risk acceptance for low-risk items, executive sign-off required, compensating controls where possible, monitor accepted risks for changes in threat landscape), avoid risk by discontinuing activity (stop processing certain data types, exit certain markets or business lines, sometimes necessary when compliance costs exceed business value).

Compliance risk register: centralized tracking of compliance-related risks (risk ID and description—clear statement of compliance risk, regulatory framework affected, likelihood and impact ratings, risk score for prioritization, current controls in place, residual risk after controls, treatment strategy and owner, target date for mitigation), regular risk reviews (quarterly risk committee meetings, update risk ratings as threat landscape or controls change, report to executive steering committee and board), risk monitoring and reporting (KRIs—key risk indicators like control failure rate, audit finding trends, real-time dashboard where possible, escalation procedures for critical risks).

**EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT**

Automate compliance evidence gathering. Evidence requirements by framework: GDPR evidence (data processing agreements with processors, consent records for processing, DPIA for high-risk processing, data subject access request logs, breach notification documentation—72-hour timeline, training records for data protection), HIPAA evidence (risk analysis annually—documented methodology and findings, policy acknowledgments from workforce, BAAs with business associates, audit logs for PHI access—who accessed what when, breach risk assessment and notification if required), SOC 2 evidence (control descriptions and design documentation, testing results for each control—samples and observations, incident logs and resolutions, change management records, vendor assessments), PCI-DSS evidence (quarterly ASV scans with passing results, penetration testing annually by QSA, network segmentation validation, firewall and router configurations with quarterly reviews, compensating controls documentation if unable to meet requirement).

Evidence collection automation: GRC platform integration (ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer, OneTrust as centralized evidence repository, automated evidence collection via integrations—SIEM logs, cloud audit logs, ticketing system data, schedule collection aligned with audit needs—daily, weekly, quarterly), automated control testing (configuration compliance scanning—daily validation of security settings, access reviews automated with manager attestation workflows, vulnerability scanning with evidence of remediation, log analysis for detective control validation), evidence retention (comply with framework requirements—SOC 2 typically 7 years, HIPAA 6 years, GDPR varies by jurisdiction, secure storage with encryption and access control, maintain chain of custody for legal defensibility).

Evidence quality assurance: completeness (all required evidence collected?, gaps identified and addressed before audit?, backup evidence available if primary insufficient?), accuracy (evidence truly demonstrates control operation?, not just screenshots of settings but proof of consistent operation, timestamp validation—evidence from correct period?), relevance (evidence directly supports control testing?, auditor will accept evidence type?, matches control description and testing procedures?), organization (evidence cataloged and easily retrievable?, tagged with control ID and test period?, evidence request fulfilled in <24 hours?).

**AUDIT PREPARATION AND MANAGEMENT**

Execute successful audit engagements. Audit planning: audit selection (internal audits quarterly for continuous monitoring, external audits for certification—SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, regulatory examinations—HIPAA, PCI-DSS, financial audits—SOX compliance), auditor selection (Big 4 for SOC 2 and complex audits, specialized firms for PCI-DSS QSA, ISO certification bodies accredited by IAF, request for proposal process—3-5 firms evaluated, review auditor qualifications and client references), scope definition (systems in scope—production only or include development?, period covered—6 months for SOC 2 Type II, 1 year for ISO 27001 surveillance, controls tested—all or risk-based sampling?, exclusions clearly documented), timeline and logistics (pre-audit readiness assessment 90 days before, evidence request and collection 60 days before, on-site audit period scheduled—typically 2-4 weeks, audit report delivery timeline—30-45 days post-fieldwork).

Audit execution: opening meeting (audit scope and objectives confirmed, audit timeline and logistics reviewed, key contacts and escalation procedures, evidence request list delivered), fieldwork (auditor testing controls—inquiry, observation, inspection, reperformance, interviews with control owners and process performers, walkthroughs of business processes, site visits if physical controls in scope), evidence provision (respond to evidence requests within SLA—typically 48 hours, provide context and explanations with evidence, track evidence requests in audit management system, escalate delays or issues to audit lead), closing meeting (preliminary findings discussed, observations and deficiencies presented—control design vs operating effectiveness failures, management response opportunity, remediation discussion).

Finding management: finding classification (deficiency—control design inadequate or operating effectiveness failure, severity—critical blocks certification, significant impacts reliance, other informational, compliance impact—does finding prevent compliance certification?), management response (accept finding or dispute with evidence, if accept develop remediation plan—specific actions, responsible parties, target dates, compensating controls while remediating, executive sign-off on management action plan), remediation tracking (findings logged in GRC system or JIRA with severity and due date, weekly remediation standups monitor progress, evidence collection for validation—retest shows finding remediated, follow-up audit or quarterly review validates sustained remediation).

**CONTINUOUS COMPLIANCE MONITORING**

Maintain compliance posture ongoing. Continuous monitoring framework: automated compliance checks (daily configuration scans validate security settings—encryption enabled, password policies enforced, real-time SIEM monitoring for policy violations—unauthorized access attempts, sensitive data access, weekly vulnerability scans with remediation tracking—critical 7 days, high 30 days, monthly access reviews—orphaned accounts, excessive permissions, quarterly control testing—representative samples, reperformance of key controls), manual periodic reviews (quarterly policy review for relevance and effectiveness, annual risk assessment updates, semi-annual vendor assessments for critical third parties, monthly compliance metrics review with management).

Compliance metrics and KPIs: control metrics (control effectiveness rate—% of controls operating effectively, control testing coverage—% of controls tested in period, control failure rate—# of control deficiencies found, time to remediate control failures—average days to closure), compliance metrics (audit findings trend—decreasing over time indicates maturity, certification status—SOC 2, ISO 27001 current or lapsed, regulatory exam results—HIPAA, PCI-DSS findings, compliance training completion—target 95%+), risk metrics (compliance risk score trending—heat map over time, residual risk levels after treatment, risk appetite exceedance—when risk exceeds tolerance), program metrics (evidence collection completeness—% of evidence ready for audit, policy acknowledgment rate—100% required, incident response time—mean time to compliance breach notification).

Compliance reporting: operational reports (weekly control testing results to security and compliance teams, monthly compliance metrics to steering committee, quarterly risk report to executive leadership), executive and board reporting (quarterly compliance status—certification current, audit findings remediated, annual compliance program review—maturity assessment, investment needs, regulatory changes and impact analysis), regulatory reporting (GDPR breach notification to supervisory authority within 72 hours if required, HIPAA breach notification to HHS annually or for breaches >500 individuals, PCI-DSS quarterly ASV scan submission, attestations of compliance—SOC 2 report, ISO 27001 certificate).

Program improvement: lessons learned from audits (what findings occurred and why?, control design flaws vs operating effectiveness failures, root cause analysis—process gaps, training needs, tool limitations, preventive actions—what changes prevent recurrence?), compliance maturity assessment (annual maturity model assessment—ad-hoc, repeatable, defined, managed, optimizing, gap analysis vs target maturity, roadmap for maturity improvement), regulatory horizon scanning (monitor for regulatory changes—GDPR updates, new HIPAA guidance, industry-specific regulations, impact assessment—do changes require control updates?, proactive adaptation before compliance deadline).

### Example 2: Healthcare Organization HIPAA Compliance
**Prompt:** Build HIPAA compliance program for HealthSystem (8 hospitals, Epic EHR, Azure cloud migration, HIPAA Security Rule focus) achieving technical, administrative, physical safeguards compliance.

**Expected Output:** Scope: All systems creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting PHI (Epic EHR production and DR, patient portal, Azure cloud infrastructure, 300+ medical devices, 340+ business associates). Gap assessment: 64% compliant with HIPAA Security Rule—36% gap (critical: no encryption for laptop fleet, incomplete BAAs with 42 vendors, insufficient audit log review, medium: missing formal risk analysis, weak password policy 8 chars should be 12+). Governance: HIPAA compliance committee (CMO, CIO, HIPAA Security Officer, HIPAA Privacy Officer, General Counsel quarterly), privacy and security working group (Security Officer chair, IT, Clinical Informatics, Legal, monthly), OCR liaison (General Counsel manages OCR relationship, breach notification coordination). Policy framework: HIPAA Security Rule comprehensive policy set (Administrative Safeguards—security management process §164.308(a)(1), workforce security, access management, Physical Safeguards—facility access, workstation security, device/media controls, Technical Safeguards—access control, audit controls, integrity, transmission security), 15 policies covering all required and addressable implementation specifications, documented implementation decisions (implement vs reasonable alternative for addressable specs), annual review required by regulation. Risk analysis: Annual risk analysis required by §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) (2024 risk analysis completed Q1, methodology: NIST SP 800-30 qualitative, scope: all systems with PHI, findings: 47 risks identified, 12 high-risk requiring immediate treatment, risk register maintained in RSA Archer), vulnerability scanning (weekly Qualys scans for all servers and network devices, medical devices scanned quarterly with vendor coordination), penetration testing (annual by external firm validates technical safeguard effectiveness). Control implementation: Administrative safeguards (workforce training—annual HIPAA training 95% completion, access authorization—role-based access to Epic, sanctions policy—progressive discipline for violations), Physical safeguards (facility access—badge system with PIN, workstation location—privacy screens in patient areas, device disposal—certified destruction with certificates), Technical safeguards (unique user IDs—no shared accounts in Epic, emergency access—break-the-glass with logging, encryption—BitLocker on all endpoints, TLS 1.3 for all connections, audit controls—comprehensive logging in Epic and Azure). Business associate management: BAA inventory (340 business associates identified—EHR vendors, cloud providers, billing services, transcription, shredding, others), BAA template (HIPAA-compliant contract language, security requirement obligations, breach notification 60 days, audit rights, data destruction upon termination), vendor risk assessment (all BAs assessed annually, critical BAs assessed quarterly, questionnaire + SOC 2 report + insurance verification), BAA tracking (100% BAA coverage achieved Month 6, quarterly verification of BAA status). Medical device security: Claroty platform for visibility (300+ connected devices—infusion pumps, ventilators, imaging equipment, patient monitors), network segmentation (medical device VLANs isolated from business network, no internet access, strict firewall rules), vendor patching coordination (scheduled maintenance windows for critical patches, emergency patches coordinated with clinical operations, some legacy devices unpatched—document risk acceptance with compensating controls). Evidence collection: Epic audit logs (all PHI access logged—who, what, when, quarterly access audits, anomaly detection for mass records access, break-the-glass activity reviewed weekly), Azure audit logs (Activity Log, NSG Flow Logs, Key Vault access logs, 2-year retention for HIPAA), training records (LMS tracks completion, certificates archived, audit-ready reports), BAA repository (signed BAAs in SharePoint with version control, searchable by vendor name). Audit preparation: HHS OCR audit (HealthSystem selected for Phase 2 audit program, scope: all HIPAA Security Rule requirements, preparation: 180 days—gap remediation, evidence collection, dry-run audit with consultant), OCR on-site (3 weeks on-site, document review—policies, risk analysis, training records, BAAs, technical validation—Epic access controls, encryption verification, audit log review, interviews—20 staff across clinical and IT), OCR findings (5 corrective actions required: formalize risk analysis methodology, enhance audit log review frequency from quarterly to monthly, complete laptop encryption 100%, obtain missing BAAs, improve sanctions policy documentation), corrective action plan (CAP submitted within 30 days, 12-month remediation timeline, quarterly status reports to OCR, all findings remediated within deadline). Breach management: Breach risk assessment (all PHI incidents assessed within 24 hours for breach determination—low probability threshold §164.402, document rationale for breach vs not-a-breach decision, Privacy Officer final authority with Legal consultation), breach notification (HHS notification within 60 days if breach affects ≥500 individuals, annual notification for breaches <500, individual notification without unreasonable delay, media notification if breach affects ≥500 in state or jurisdiction), breach prevention (DLP prevents email PHI to personal accounts, endpoint encryption protects lost laptops, access controls limit PHI exposure, annual breach response tabletop exercises).

### Example 3: E-Commerce Platform GDPR + PCI-DSS Multi-Framework Compliance
**Prompt:** Build multi-framework compliance for ShopCorp e-commerce (EU customers, payment processing, AWS infrastructure) achieving GDPR + PCI-DSS + ISO 27001 compliance.

**Expected Output:** Multi-framework scope: GDPR (all personal data of EU customers—names, emails, addresses, order history, tracking cookies), PCI-DSS (payment card data—card number, CVV, expiration date processed via Stripe—tokenization, no storage of card data), ISO 27001 (all information assets—customer data, employee data, intellectual property, business systems). Control mapping: Control overlaps across frameworks (encryption required by all three—GDPR Article 32, PCI-DSS Requirement 3, ISO 27001 A.10.1, single implementation satisfies multiple frameworks, access control—GDPR access limitation, PCI-DSS Requirement 7, ISO 27001 A.9.1), framework-specific controls (GDPR-only: data subject rights—access, rectification, erasure, portability, PCI-DSS-only: quarterly ASV scans, annual penetration test by QSA, ISO 27001-only: management review, corrective action process). Unified control framework: 127 controls total (47 satisfy all three frameworks, 31 satisfy GDPR + ISO only, 28 satisfy PCI + ISO only, 21 GDPR-specific), control mapping matrix (maps each control to framework requirements—GDPR Article, PCI Requirement, ISO Annex A control, single testing validates multiple frameworks). Governance: Multi-framework steering committee (CEO, CFO, CTO, General Counsel, DPO quarterly), DPO role (required by GDPR Article 37, reports to CEO and board, independent oversight of data processing, also serves as ISO 27001 Information Security Manager, separate from PCI-DSS compliance officer to avoid conflict), compliance working group (Security Manager = PCI compliance officer, Privacy Manager = DPO deputy, IT Manager, monthly coordination). GDPR implementation: Lawful basis for processing (legitimate interest for fraud prevention, contract performance for order fulfillment, consent for marketing—granular opt-in, document basis in data processing register), data subject rights (web portal for access requests—automated response within 30 days, rectification/erasure workflows in customer admin tool, data portability—JSON export of customer data, objection and restriction workflows), DPIAs (data protection impact assessments for high-risk processing—profiling for recommendations assessed as low risk, cross-border transfers to US via Standard Contractual Clauses post-Schrems II), breach notification (72-hour notification to supervisory authority via online portal if risk to rights and freedoms, individual notification without undue delay if high risk, breach register maintained with all incidents even if not notifiable). PCI-DSS implementation: Cardholder data environment (CDE scoping: Stripe.js tokenization—card data never touches ShopCorp infrastructure, CDE = Stripe payment page and API only, network segmentation validation quarterly—no direct connection between ShopCorp app and full card data), compensating controls (Requirement 6.5.8 SQL injection—Stripe API doesn't accept SQL so risk not applicable, document compensating control with QSA approval), quarterly compliance (external ASV scans quarterly—passing results required, internal vulnerability scans quarterly, patch critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, firewall configuration review quarterly), annual on-site QSA audit (PCI-DSS Level 2 requires annual SAQ or QSA based on volume—ShopCorp at 3M transactions annually, full QSA audit required, QSA from approved firm validates 12 requirements). ISO 27001 implementation: ISMS scope (all ShopCorp systems—e-commerce platform, AWS infrastructure, employee systems, third-party integrations), Statement of Applicability (114 controls from Annex A, 98 applicable and implemented, 16 not applicable with justification—no on-premises datacenter controls, telework controls not applicable for remote-first company), risk treatment plan (37 risks identified in risk assessment, 29 mitigated through controls, 5 accepted with management approval, 3 transferred via cyber insurance), management review (semi-annual review by executive team—ISMS performance, audit results, risk changes, improvement opportunities). Unified GRC platform: OneTrust Privacy + Compliance modules ($400K annual, privacy module for GDPR—consent management, data subject requests, cookie compliance, compliance module for control testing and audit management, integration with AWS for automated evidence—CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty), control testing (quarterly testing cycle—Q1 tests 25%, Q2 tests 25%, Q3 tests 25%, Q4 tests 25% + year-end close, evidence auto-collected from AWS, GitHub, Okta), audit preparation (evidence repository organized by framework and control, audit-ready reports for each framework, 90-day preparation period before audits). Audit cycle: Staggered audit schedule (Q1: PCI-DSS QSA audit, Q2: GDPR supervisory authority inspection preparation, Q3: ISO 27001 certification audit stage 1, Q4: ISO 27001 certification audit stage 2 + PCI quarterly scan), auditor coordination (single Big 4 firm for ISO 27001 and SOC 2—synergies, PCI-DSS QSA separate specialized firm, GDPR—DPO internal, supervisory authority liaison), audit efficiency (unified evidence repository, shared control testing, single remediation tracker for all findings). Compliance metrics: Unified dashboard (control effectiveness by framework—GDPR 96%, PCI 98%, ISO 94%, audit readiness score 93%, findings remediation velocity—average 22 days to closure), cost efficiency (multi-framework overlap reduces total cost—single encryption implementation satisfies three frameworks, total compliance cost $1.8M vs $2.4M if separate programs). Outcomes: ISO 27001 certified Year 1, PCI-DSS compliant (QSA attestation), GDPR no supervisory authority findings, multi-framework approach reduced cost 25%. Budget: $1.8M total ($400K OneTrust, $350K QSA and ISO audits, $600K implementation, $450K ongoing).
