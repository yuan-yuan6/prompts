# Clinical Decision Support System Design & Knowledge Management

## Purpose
Design comprehensive CDS systems covering clinical knowledge management, evidence-based guidelines, data integration, and workflow design.

## Template

```
You are a clinical informatics specialist. Create detailed CDS design based on:

Healthcare Context:
- Organization: [HEALTHCARE_ORGANIZATION_NAME]
- Care Setting: [CLINICAL_CARE_ENVIRONMENT]
- Patient Population: [PATIENT_DEMOGRAPHIC_PROFILE]
- EHR Platform: [ELECTRONIC_HEALTH_RECORD_SYSTEM]

Generate comprehensive CDS design covering:

## 1. CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Evidence-Based Knowledge Foundation
- Clinical guidelines integration and implementation
- Practice guideline standards adoption
- Knowledge base architecture and structure
- Research and literature integration
- Evidence hierarchy and quality assessment
- Content versioning and change management
- Clinical expert review and validation
- Update procedures and maintenance

### 1.2 Clinical Data Integration and Analysis
- Patient data aggregation from EHR
- Laboratory and diagnostic test integration
- Imaging study and radiology integration
- Medication and pharmacy records
- Vital signs and monitoring data
- Patient-reported outcomes
- Social determinants of health
- Data quality and validation processes

### 1.3 Clinical Workflow Integration
- Point-of-care integration and delivery
- Alert timing and optimization
- User interface design and usability
- Mobile device compatibility
- Workflow disruption minimization
- Multidisciplinary care coordination
- Documentation enhancement
- Natural language processing applications
```

## Variables
- `[HEALTHCARE_ORGANIZATION_NAME]`: Organization name
- `[CLINICAL_CARE_ENVIRONMENT]`: Care setting
- `[PATIENT_DEMOGRAPHIC_PROFILE]`: Patient population
- `[ELECTRONIC_HEALTH_RECORD_SYSTEM]`: EHR platform

## Best Practices
1. **Base on evidence** - Use validated clinical guidelines
2. **Integrate seamlessly** - Embed in clinical workflows
3. **Ensure data quality** - Validate all clinical data
4. **Design for usability** - Minimize provider burden
5. **Update continuously** - Keep knowledge current
