# M&A Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to execute an M&A transaction across six dimensions: Deal Thesis & Scope, Due Diligence Readiness, Deal Structure & Terms, Regulatory & Approvals, Integration Readiness, and Governance & Execution. Identify gaps, reduce avoidable risk, and produce an actionable plan.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **M&A readiness** for **[ACQUIRER]** pursuing **[TRANSACTION_TYPE]** of **[TARGET]** for **[DEAL_VALUE]** with **[DEAL_STRUCTURE]** over **[TIMELINE]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Deal thesis & scope**—is the value-creation logic clear and testable? (2) **Due diligence readiness**—are workstreams staffed with clear asks, a data room plan, and red-flag criteria? (3) **Structure & terms**—are key term positions and fallbacks defined (price mechanics, reps/warranties, indemnities, MAC, escrow)? (4) **Regulatory & approvals**—are antitrust/sector approvals, privacy, export controls, and governance approvals mapped? (5) **Integration readiness**—is Day 1/100-day planning realistic with owners? (6) **Governance & execution**—is there a decision cadence, issue log, and risk register? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a transaction plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid readiness evaluation.

## Template

Conduct an M&A readiness assessment for {ACQUIRER} pursuing a {TRANSACTION_TYPE} of {TARGET} for {DEAL_VALUE} using {DEAL_STRUCTURE} over {TIMELINE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. DEAL THESIS & SCOPE READINESS**
- Strategic rationale is specific and testable (why this target, why now)
- Value drivers and hypotheses are defined (growth, cost, capability, risk reduction)
- Scope is clear (assets/entities/products/geos included and excluded)
- Key assumptions and sensitivities are explicit (customer retention, churn, margin)
- Walk-away conditions are defined (price, risk, approvals, thesis breaks)

**2. DUE DILIGENCE READINESS**
- Workstreams defined and staffed (financial, legal, commercial, ops, tech, HR)
- Diligence asks are prioritized (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Data room plan exists (structure, owners, completeness checks)
- Red-flag criteria are defined per workstream (what triggers escalation)
- Findings are tracked consistently (issues log, severity, remediation options)

**3. DEAL STRUCTURE & TERMS READINESS**
- Structure options evaluated (stock/asset/merger; tax and liability implications)
- Term positions and fallbacks exist (price mechanics, earnouts, escrows)
- Risk allocation positions are defined (reps/warranties, indemnities, caps, baskets)
- Closing conditions and termination rights are clear (incl. financing and approvals)
- Disclosure schedule approach is planned (who drafts, how to validate)

**4. REGULATORY, COMPLIANCE & APPROVALS READINESS**
- Approval map exists (board/shareholder/financing/committee) with timelines
- Antitrust and sector approvals assessed (and counsel strategy defined)
- Privacy, security, and data transfer risks assessed for integration
- Export controls/sanctions/other jurisdiction constraints considered as relevant
- External comms readiness considered (regulators, customers, employees)

**5. INTEGRATION READINESS (DAY 1 / 100-DAY)**
- Day 1 requirements are identified (access, payroll, systems, customer continuity)
- Integration workstreams and owners are defined (people, systems, ops, finance)
- Synergy capture plan is realistic and measurable (baseline, owners, cadence)
- Culture and retention risks are assessed (critical roles, incentives, comms)
- Separation/transition planning exists where needed (TSA, carve-outs)

**6. GOVERNANCE, EXECUTION & RISK MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Deal team roles and decision rights are clear (RACI)
- Cadence exists (steering, workstream updates, escalation path)
- Risk register is maintained (probability, impact, mitigations, owners)
- Budget and advisors are controlled (scope, burn rate, deliverables)
- Documentation and audit trail are disciplined (decisions, approvals, changes)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 risks, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **DILIGENCE PLAN** - Workstreams, asks, red flags, timeline, owners
4. **ISSUES LOG + RISK REGISTER** - Ranked issues with actions, owners, and decision dates
5. **TERMS POSITIONS** - Key term positions and fallbacks (price, indemnity, MAC, escrow)
6. **INTEGRATION READINESS PLAN** - Day 1 checklist + 100-day plan

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc diligence, unclear governance, high execution risk)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic plan, gaps in staffing/terms/integration)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable diligence, clear positions, integration planning underway)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined governance, quantified risks, predictable execution)
- 5.0: Optimized (high repeatability, fast cycle time, strong outcomes and learning loop)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ACQUIRER]` | Buying entity | "Orchid Health Systems" |
| `[TARGET]` | Target entity | "CarePath Analytics" |
| `[TRANSACTION_TYPE]` | Deal type | "Strategic acquisition" |
| `[DEAL_VALUE]` | Transaction value | "$250M" |
| `[DEAL_STRUCTURE]` | Structure | "Stock purchase" |
| `[TIMELINE]` | Timeline | "10 weeks to signing" |

## Example

**Healthcare - Strategic Acquisition**

> Assess M&A readiness for **Orchid Health Systems** pursuing a **strategic acquisition** of **CarePath Analytics** for **$250M** via **stock purchase** over **10 weeks to signing**. Thesis is strong but key assumptions (retention, synergy timing) aren’t quantified; diligence staffing exists but data room asks lack prioritization; term fallback positions are incomplete for indemnity and escrow; antitrust risk is low but privacy and data transfer risks are unclear; integration plan has Day 1 gaps in systems access and customer communications; governance cadence is set but risk register is not maintained. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a concrete diligence plan + Day 1/100-day checklist.
