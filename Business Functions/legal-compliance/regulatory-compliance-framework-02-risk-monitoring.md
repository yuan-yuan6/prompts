# Regulatory Compliance Readiness Assessment - Part 2: Risk Management & Monitoring

## Purpose
Assess readiness to operate compliance risk management and monitoring across six dimensions: Risk Taxonomy & Methodology, Monitoring & Surveillance, KRIs & Alerting, Regulatory Change Management, Training & Competency, and Reporting & Escalation. Identify gaps and produce an operational plan.

## Template

Conduct a compliance risk management and monitoring readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} under {CORE_REGULATIONS} across {JURISDICTIONS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. RISK TAXONOMY & METHODOLOGY READINESS**
- Risk taxonomy is clear and adopted (themes → obligations → processes)
- Risk scoring approach exists (impact, likelihood, velocity, detectability)
- Controls are mapped to risks (and owners are defined)
- Risk register is maintained with review cadence
- Thresholds and risk appetite are translated into operating guardrails

**2. MONITORING & SURVEILLANCE READINESS**
- Monitoring coverage is defined (what is monitored, why, and how often)
- Investigation workflow exists (triage, evidence, decision, remediation)
- Case management discipline exists (owners, SLAs, audit trail)
- Sampling and QA approach exists where automated monitoring is limited
- Third-party monitoring is included where relevant

**3. KRIs, THRESHOLDS & ALERTING READINESS**
- KRIs exist and are measurable (leading/lagging)
- Thresholds are tuned (noise vs missed risk is managed)
- Alerts have playbooks (what to do when triggered)
- Dashboards exist for operators and leadership
- Metrics drive action (not just reporting)

**4. REGULATORY CHANGE MANAGEMENT READINESS**
- Change detection sources are defined (regulators, counsel, industry)
- Impact assessments are consistent and documented
- Implementation has owners, timelines, and testing
- Training/communications are triggered by relevant changes
- Evidence of implementation is retrievable (policy updates, controls, attestations)

**5. TRAINING & COMPETENCY READINESS**
- Training is role-based and mapped to obligations and processes
- Competency is assessed (testing, certification, observation)
- Exceptions and overdue training are governed
- Effectiveness is measured (incidents, control failures, survey, outcomes)
- New-hire onboarding and periodic refresh are defined

**6. REPORTING, ESCALATION & ISSUE HANDLING READINESS**
- Severity model exists (impact, scope, regulatory exposure)
- Escalation triggers are defined (and used consistently)
- Management reporting cadence exists (ops → exec → board)
- Issue closure criteria exist (fix, validate, prevent recurrence)
- Lessons learned loop into policies, monitoring, and training

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 operational priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **MONITORING COVERAGE MAP** - What is monitored, frequency, tooling, and gaps
4. **KRI DASHBOARD SPEC** - KRIs, thresholds, owners, and actions
5. **REG CHANGE WORKFLOW** - Detect → assess → implement → evidence
6. **90-DAY PLAN** - Uplift actions to reduce noise, close gaps, and improve evidence

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (limited monitoring, reactive issue handling)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic KRIs and processes, inconsistent execution)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable monitoring and change management)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (measured effectiveness, disciplined investigations)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive detection, continuous tuning, strong outcomes)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization name | "National Payments Processor" |
| `[CORE_REGULATIONS]` | Primary obligations | "AML, privacy, consumer protection" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Jurisdictions | "US + EU" |

## Example

**Payments - Monitoring Uplift**

> Assess compliance risk management readiness for **National Payments Processor** under **AML, privacy, consumer protection** across **US + EU**. Risk taxonomy exists but control mapping is incomplete; monitoring alerts are noisy and investigations aren’t consistently documented; KRIs exist but thresholds aren’t tuned and playbooks are missing; regulatory change management relies on ad-hoc emails; training completion is tracked but competency is not tested; reporting exists but issue closure criteria are unclear. Provide scorecard and a 90-day plan to establish case management discipline, tuned KRIs with playbooks, and evidence-ready change management.
