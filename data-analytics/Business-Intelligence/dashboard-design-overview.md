## Success Factors

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Executive sponsorship** - Active champion at executive level
2. **Clear business objectives** - Well-defined success criteria
3. **User involvement** - Early and continuous user engagement
4. **Data quality** - Clean, reliable source data
5. **Skilled team** - Right mix of business and technical skills
6. **Iterative approach** - Start small, expand based on feedback
7. **Change management** - User training and adoption strategy
8. **Ongoing support** - Dedicated team for maintenance and enhancement

### Common Failure Patterns
- Starting with technology before understanding requirements
- Ignoring data quality issues
- Building everything at once instead of iterating
- Poor user training and adoption
- Inadequate ongoing support and maintenance
- Over-engineering for current needs
- Insufficient stakeholder alignment
- Neglecting mobile and accessibility

---

## When to Use Multiple Prompts

Most dashboard projects require multiple prompts. Use them in parallel when:

**Parallel workstreams:**
- **Strategy + UX Design** - Business analysts and designers can work together
- **Data Architecture + Security** - Both can start once requirements are clear
- **Technical Implementation + Testing** - QA can prepare while infrastructure is being built

**Sequential dependencies:**
- **Strategy → UX Design** - Need requirements before designing interface
- **Data Architecture → Technical Implementation** - Platform choice depends on data needs
- **All → Testing & Deployment** - Testing requires completed components
