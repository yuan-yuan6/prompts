# Hotel Operations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run hotel operations effectively across staffing, guest experience, housekeeping, maintenance, and performance management.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess hotel operations readiness for property [PROPERTY]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Guest journey & service standards, (2) Staffing & scheduling, (3) Housekeeping & maintenance, (4) Systems & data, (5) Revenue/ops coordination, (6) Governance & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard and 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Guest Journey & Service Standards
- 1 — Initial: Standards unclear; experience inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Service standards documented; QA checks exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Experience is consistently excellent; feedback drives improvements.

### 2) Staffing & Scheduling
- 1 — Initial: Staffing reactive; coverage issues common.
- 3 — Defined: Roles and schedules planned; training exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Staffing is optimized; coverage stable and performance managed.

### 3) Housekeeping & Maintenance
- 1 — Initial: Backlogs high; issues discovered late.
- 3 — Defined: SOPs and preventive maintenance; issue tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are proactive; downtime and guest-impact minimized.

### 4) Systems & Data
- 1 — Initial: Systems fragmented; data unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Core systems in place; reporting and data quality defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Systems integrate well; data supports optimization and decisions.

### 5) Revenue/Ops Coordination
- 1 — Initial: Revenue and ops disconnected; tradeoffs unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Coordination cadence; shared KPIs defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Coordination is mature; decisions optimize guest + revenue outcomes.

### 6) Governance & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No cadence for improvement; issues repeat.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence; KPIs and reviews exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement is systematic and sustained.

## Deliverables
- Operations readiness scorecard and gap list
- Service standards and QA checklist
- Staffing/training plan and schedules
- Housekeeping/maintenance SOPs and backlog plan
- Governance cadence and KPI dashboard outline

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROPERTY]: Property
- [SERVICE_STANDARDS]: Standards
- [STAFFING]: Staffing constraints
- [SYSTEMS]: Systems
- [KPIS]: KPIs
- [GUEST_FEEDBACK]: Feedback sources

## Example (Condensed)
- Property: 250-room business hotel
- Scores (1–5): Service 3; Staffing 2; Ops 3; Systems 2; Coordination 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Stabilize staffing and training; integrate reporting; improve revenue/ops cadence; establish KPI reviews
