# Product Roadmapping & Planning Template

## Purpose
Create strategic product roadmaps that communicate product direction, prioritize initiatives, align stakeholders, and guide execution while maintaining flexibility to adapt to learning and market changes.

## Quick Roadmap Prompt
Create product roadmap for [product] covering [timeframe]. Use Now-Next-Later format. Gather inputs: customer feedback themes, strategic priorities, technical debt, stakeholder requests. Prioritize using RICE. Define: NOW (committed, detailed), NEXT (planned, flexible), LATER (exploratory). Include: initiative descriptions, success metrics, dependencies, resource estimates. Create versions for: engineering team, executives, customers.

## Quick Start

**Need a roadmap quickly?** Use the Now-Next-Later framework:

### Minimal Example
```
NOW (Q1 2025):
- AI-powered search (solves #1 customer pain point)
- Mobile app launch (opens new market segment)
- Enterprise SSO (unlocks enterprise deals)

NEXT (Q2-Q3 2025):
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- API platform for integrations
- Team collaboration features

LATER (Q4 2025+):
- International expansion
- AI agents and automation
- Industry-specific solutions
```

### When to Use This
- Annual and quarterly planning cycles
- After product strategy refresh
- When communicating to board or executives
- Aligning engineering and go-to-market teams
- Managing stakeholder expectations

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Gather inputs** - Customer feedback, strategy, metrics, stakeholder requests (1 week)
2. **Prioritize & sequence** - Use framework (RICE, value/effort) to prioritize (1 week)
3. **Create & communicate** - Build roadmap views for different audiences (3 days)

## Best Practices

**Roadmap Creation:**
1. **Outcome-focused** - Show outcomes and value, not just features
2. **Theme-based** - Group initiatives into coherent themes
3. **Flexible** - Use Now-Next-Later vs rigid dates for future items
4. **Transparent** - Share the "why" behind priorities
5. **Realistic** - Account for uncertainty and buffer capacity

**Prioritization:**
1. **Data-driven** - Use frameworks (RICE, Value/Effort) consistently
2. **Strategic alignment** - Tie to company OKRs and strategy
3. **Customer-centric** - Weight customer impact heavily
4. **Balance** - Mix quick wins, strategic bets, technical debt
5. **Say no often** - Saying no is as important as saying yes

**Stakeholder Management:**
1. **Multiple views** - Tailor roadmap to audience
2. **Regular updates** - Communicate changes proactively
3. **Manage expectations** - Be clear about confidence levels
4. **Show tradeoffs** - Help stakeholders understand opportunity cost
5. **Collect feedback** - Make it easy to provide input

**Execution:**
1. **Right-sized initiatives** - Break large projects into milestones
2. **Clear ownership** - Every initiative has a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)
3. **Track progress** - Weekly/bi-weekly roadmap reviews
4. **Learn and adapt** - Use data to inform roadmap changes
5. **Celebrate wins** - Recognize completed milestones

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Feature lists** - Listing features without context or value
✅ Instead: Frame as problems being solved and outcomes

❌ **Overly detailed long-term plans** - Committing to features 12+ months out
✅ Instead: Themes and directions for later, detailed plans for soon

❌ **Dates as commitments** - Treating all roadmap items as firm commitments
✅ Instead: Show confidence levels, use quarters not dates for future

❌ **Kitchen sink roadmap** - Everything everyone ever asked for
✅ Instead: Ruthless prioritization and clear rationale

❌ **Build it and they will come** - No GTM plan for launches
✅ Instead: GTM strategy for every major initiative
