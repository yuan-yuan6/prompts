# Sustainable Fashion & Circular Economy Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for implementing sustainable fashion strategies including eco-friendly materials, ethical production, circular business models, supply chain transparency, consumer engagement, and environmental impact measurement for fashion industry transformation.

## Quick Sustainable Fashion Prompt
Develop sustainability strategy for [brand name] with [X] annual production volume. Goals: [Y]% carbon reduction, [Z]% sustainable materials by [year]. Plan: eco-material transition (organic/recycled/innovative fibers), ethical supplier audit framework, one circular initiative (rental/resale/repair), supply chain transparency roadmap, and impact measurement dashboard. Quick win: design take-back program for immediate customer engagement.

## Quick Start

**For Fashion Brands Going Sustainable:**
1. **Assess Current Impact** - Use Section 1 to baseline your sustainability across materials, production, and social responsibility
2. **Switch to Eco-Materials** - Start with Section 2, replacing 20-30% of materials with organic cotton, recycled polyester, or Tencel
3. **Implement One Circular Model** - Choose from Section 6 (rental, resale, or repair program) as your first circular initiative
4. **Map Supply Chain** - Use Section 5 to gain visibility into Tier 1 suppliers (manufacturers) before expanding to deeper tiers
5. **Set Measurable Goals** - Reference Section 8 to establish targets like "30% carbon reduction" or "50% waste diversion by 2026"

**Quick Win:** Launch a take-back program where customers return old items for store credit, creating immediate circular engagement.
