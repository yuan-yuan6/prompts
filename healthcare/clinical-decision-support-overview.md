### 2. Rules, Algorithms & Diagnostic Support
**File:** `cds-rules-algorithms.md`
- Differential diagnosis support
- Clinical pathway guidance
- Risk stratification
- Medication management
- Drug safety checking

### 3. Technology Integration & AI
**File:** `cds-integration.md`
- Quality improvement systems
- AI-powered decision support
- Advanced analytics
- Innovation adoption

### 4. Evaluation & Performance Monitoring
**File:** `cds-evaluation.md`
- Clinical impact assessment
- Performance monitoring
