# Pricing Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess pricing and packaging strategy readiness across six dimensions: Value Foundation, Model Selection, Packaging Architecture, Price Point Optimization, Go-to-Market Execution, and Continuous Optimization. This framework identifies monetization gaps, strengthens pricing strategy, and creates optimization roadmaps that align price with value, competitive position, and revenue objectives.

## 🚀 Quick Pricing Assessment Prompt

> Assess **pricing strategy readiness** for **[PRODUCT/COMPANY]** offering **[PRODUCT TYPE]** to **[TARGET MARKET]** with **[BUSINESS MODEL]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Value foundation**—is customer value quantified? What's willingness-to-pay research showing? Is pricing tied to measurable ROI? (2) **Model selection**—does pricing model align with value delivery? Is value metric clear and scalable? (3) **Packaging architecture**—do tiers serve different segments? Is feature allocation logical? (4) **Price points**—are prices psychologically optimized? Tested with customers? Competitive position clear? (5) **Go-to-market execution**—is sales team enabled? Discounting governed? (6) **Optimization**—are conversion metrics tracked? Testing roadmap defined? Provide a maturity scorecard (1-5 per dimension), monetization gaps, pricing recommendations, and optimization roadmap.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive pricing strategy readiness assessment for {PRODUCT_CONTEXT}, offering {PRODUCT_SCOPE} to achieve {REVENUE_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Value Foundation Readiness**

Assess whether pricing is anchored in customer value rather than costs or arbitrary benchmarks. Evaluate value quantification including whether economic benefits like time savings, cost reductions, or revenue increases are measured with customer data rather than assumed. Examine willingness-to-pay research determining whether Van Westendorp price sensitivity analysis, conjoint studies, or customer interviews reveal optimal price ranges and acceptable bounds. Review value-to-price ratio including whether total value delivered exceeds price by target multiple of ten-to-one or higher demonstrating clear ROI. Analyze customer segment value variation determining whether enterprise customers, mid-market, and SMB segments perceive different value levels requiring differentiated pricing. Assess competitive value positioning including whether value delivered compared to alternatives justifies premium, parity, or penetration pricing strategy. Evaluate value metric identification determining whether the unit customers pay for correlates with value received and grows naturally as customer success increases.

**2. Model Selection Readiness**

Evaluate whether pricing model aligns with product economics and customer preferences. Assess model appropriateness including whether per-user, usage-based, flat-rate subscription, tiered, freemium, or hybrid approaches match how value is delivered and consumed. Examine value metric clarity determining whether what customers pay for is easily understood, measurable, predictable, and scales with customer growth or usage intensity. Review revenue predictability including whether model enables accurate forecasting, supports sales planning, and provides clear expansion revenue visibility. Analyze customer acquisition friction determining whether payment complexity, commitment requirements, or pricing opacity create barriers to initial purchase or trial conversion. Assess scalability characteristics including whether pricing model supports growth from individual users to enterprise deployments without fundamental restructuring. Evaluate competitive model alignment determining whether approach matches or intentionally differs from market norms in ways that create advantage rather than confusion.

**3. Packaging Architecture Readiness**

Assess whether tier structure and feature allocation capture value across customer segments. Evaluate tier strategy effectiveness including whether three-tier good-better-best structure serves entry, mainstream, and premium segments or whether simpler or more complex tiering is justified. Examine feature allocation logic determining whether capabilities are distributed based on customer needs and willingness to pay rather than arbitrary gatekeeping or technical complexity. Review tier naming and positioning including whether labels communicate value proposition, target segment is obvious, and most popular tier is clearly marked to anchor decisions. Analyze entry tier design determining whether free or low-cost option drives adoption and qualification while creating clear upgrade paths when usage or needs expand. Assess anchor tier effectiveness including whether highest-priced option makes target tier seem reasonably priced through contrast even if few customers select premium level. Evaluate upsell and expansion paths determining whether customers can grow through tiers naturally as team size, usage, or sophistication increases without hitting artificial ceilings.

**4. Price Point Optimization Readiness**

Evaluate whether specific prices are set strategically rather than arbitrarily. Assess psychological pricing application including whether charm pricing like ninety-nine dollars versus one hundred dollars or prestige pricing with round numbers signals appropriate market position. Examine competitive price positioning determining whether premium requires twenty to fifty percent above alternatives with value justification, parity matches within ten percent, or penetration undercuts by twenty to forty percent for market share. Review annual versus monthly optimization including whether annual prepay offers fifteen to twenty-five percent discount presented as months free to improve cash flow and reduce churn. Analyze discount strategy governance determining whether volume discounts, competitive displacement offers, and promotional pricing have clear guardrails preventing margin erosion. Assess price testing methodology including whether A/B tests on landing pages, sales conversations, or cohort analysis reveal price sensitivity and optimal points. Evaluate international pricing approach determining whether purchasing power parity adjustments, local currency pricing, and regional variations reflect market realities versus creating arbitrage risks.

**5. Go-to-Market Execution Readiness**

Assess whether pricing strategy is operationalized effectively across sales and customer success. Evaluate sales enablement including whether teams understand value proposition, can articulate ROI, handle price objections, and know when discounting is appropriate versus defending price. Examine billing system capability determining whether infrastructure supports chosen pricing model, handles upgrades and downgrades seamlessly, and enables self-service or sales-assisted transactions as designed. Review contract and legal alignment including whether standard terms, payment terms, and commitment structures support pricing strategy without creating friction or risk. Analyze customer migration planning determining whether existing customers are grandfathered appropriately, migrated with clear communication and incentives, or handled through other retention strategies. Assess competitive response preparedness including whether playbooks address competitor price cuts, new entrants, or market shifts without reflexive discounting. Evaluate partner and channel pricing determining whether reseller margins, marketplace listings, and indirect sales economics align with direct pricing strategy.

**6. Continuous Optimization Readiness**

Evaluate whether pricing evolves based on data and market changes rather than remaining static. Assess metrics instrumentation including whether conversion rates by tier, average revenue per user, customer lifetime value, discount rates, and churn by price point are tracked systematically. Examine testing roadmap including whether quarterly experiments on price points, tier structures, or packaging variations are planned with clear hypotheses and success criteria. Review competitive monitoring determining whether competitor pricing changes, new entrant strategies, and market positioning shifts trigger analysis and potential response. Analyze expansion revenue tracking including whether upsell rates, cross-sell attachment, and seat expansion metrics reveal packaging and pricing optimization opportunities. Assess pricing review cadence including whether monthly metric reviews, quarterly strategy assessments, and annual comprehensive evaluations are scheduled with clear ownership. Evaluate feature release pricing determining whether new capabilities are allocated to existing tiers, create new premium options, or justify price increases through documented value addition.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Pricing Overview** providing current pricing model, target customer segments, competitive positioning, revenue targets, and key business constraints.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Pricing Strengths** listing what's working well including effective model choices, strong value alignment, or successful tier structures worth maintaining.

4. **Monetization Gaps** identifying critical weaknesses ranked by revenue impact and urgency, with specific improvement recommendations and expected benefit.

5. **Optimization Roadmap** providing phased actions: immediate fixes within thirty days addressing critical issues, strategic improvements within ninety days enhancing model or packaging, and long-term evolution over six to twelve months building optimization capabilities.

6. **Success Metrics** defining what optimized pricing looks like including conversion rate targets, ARPU goals, LTV-to-CAC ratios, and expansion revenue benchmarks.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with cost-based or arbitrary pricing, 2.0-2.9 Developing with basic model but limited testing, 3.0-3.9 Defined with value-based pricing and clear tiers, 4.0-4.9 Managed with systematic optimization and strong metrics, 5.0 Optimized with continuous testing and market-leading monetization.
