# Client Relations Management Prompt Template

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for managing client relationships, communications, and engagement strategies to maximize satisfaction, retention, and business growth.

## Quick Start

**Need to improve client engagement quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Client segment: Enterprise account worth $10M annually
Relationship stage: Established 5-year partnership at risk
Warning signs: Usage declining, support tickets increasing, contract renewal in 3 months
Goal: Retain account and expand services by 20%
Action: Executive business review, value demonstration, and renewal strategy
```

### When to Use This
- Onboarding new enterprise clients successfully
- Managing at-risk accounts showing churn signals
- Developing account growth and expansion strategies
- Conducting quarterly business reviews with strategic clients

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Assess Health** - Review usage analytics, satisfaction scores, and engagement metrics to identify risks and opportunities
2. **Plan Engagement** - Map stakeholders, define value metrics, and establish communication cadence
3. **Execute Strategy** - Conduct business reviews, demonstrate ROI, and develop account expansion plan

**Time to complete**: 2-3 hours for account health assessment, 1-2 days for comprehensive account strategy
