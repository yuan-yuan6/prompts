# Teaching & Curriculum Development Overview

## Purpose
Overview of comprehensive curriculum development framework for educational programs including course design, module development, assessment integration, faculty support, and implementation planning.

## Overview

Curriculum development requires a systematic, comprehensive approach that addresses program vision, course design, assessment, faculty development, and implementation. This framework provides a complete methodology for creating and launching educational programs that achieve learning outcomes and meet stakeholder needs.

## Framework Components

### 1. Curriculum Framework ([curriculum-framework.md](curriculum-framework.md))
**Focus:** Program vision, needs analysis, and learning outcomes
- Curriculum overview and executive summary
- Program description and educational goals
- Comprehensive needs analysis
- Learner and stakeholder analysis
- Environmental scanning
- Program-level learning outcomes
- Course-level objectives
- Competency framework (knowledge, skills, attitudes)

**Use when:** Starting a new program, defining program vision, conducting needs analysis, or establishing learning outcomes.

### 2. Course Development ([curriculum-course-development.md](curriculum-course-development.md))
**Focus:** Course structure, sequencing, and learning experiences
- Curriculum structure and sequencing
- Program architecture by year/semester
- Course categories and prerequisites
- Detailed course design templates
- Module and content organization
- Active learning strategies
- Field experiences and internships
- Digital learning integration
- Technology-enhanced learning

**Use when:** Designing individual courses, sequencing curriculum, planning learning activities, or integrating technology.

### 3. Assessment & Integration ([curriculum-assessment-integration.md](curriculum-assessment-integration.md))
**Focus:** Assessment design and curriculum mapping
- Assessment philosophy and framework
- Traditional, performance, and alternative assessments
- Rubric development
- Standards alignment (national, professional, institutional)
- Outcome mapping matrix
- Vertical and horizontal integration
- Curriculum mapping
- Quality assurance measures

**Use when:** Designing assessment systems, aligning to standards, mapping outcomes, or ensuring curriculum coherence.

### 4. Faculty Development ([faculty-development-support.md](faculty-development-support.md))
**Focus:** Faculty qualifications and resource planning
- Faculty qualification requirements
- Professional development programs
- Orientation and ongoing training
- Support resources and services
- Human resource planning
- Physical facility requirements
- Technology infrastructure
- Library and information resources

**Use when:** Planning faculty recruitment, designing professional development, allocating resources, or building infrastructure.

### 5. Implementation Plan ([curriculum-implementation-plan.md](curriculum-implementation-plan.md))
**Focus:** Quality assurance, launch, and sustainability
- Quality assurance framework
- Implementation timeline and milestones
- Stakeholder engagement strategy
- Student recruitment and support
- Industry partnerships
- Budget and financial planning
- Risk management and mitigation
- Continuous improvement process

**Use when:** Launching a program, ensuring quality, engaging stakeholders, budgeting, or managing implementation risks.

## Integrated Development Process

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
1. Define program vision and mission
2. Conduct comprehensive needs analysis
3. Analyze learners and stakeholders
4. Scan competitive environment
5. Establish program-level outcomes
6. Form curriculum development team

### Phase 2: Design (Months 3-5)
1. Design curriculum structure and sequencing
2. Develop detailed course outlines
3. Create assessment framework
4. Design rubrics and evaluation tools
5. Map curriculum to standards

### Phase 3: Development (Months 5-6)
1. Develop complete course materials
2. Create learning activities and resources
3. Design assessments and rubrics
4. Build technology infrastructure
5. Prepare faculty development programs
6. Finalize resource requirements

### Phase 4: Pilot (Months 7-12)
1. Launch pilot program with small cohort
2. Implement faculty development
3. Provide student support services
4. Collect continuous feedback
5. Make real-time adjustments
6. Evaluate pilot results

### Phase 5: Full Launch (Months 13-18)
1. Scale to full program implementation
2. Expand recruitment and enrollment
