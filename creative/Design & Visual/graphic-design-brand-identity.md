## Quick Start

**Create Your First Design Asset in 30 Minutes**

1. **Know Your Mission** (5 min): What's the ONE message this design must communicate?
2. **Gather Inspiration** (5 min): Find 3 examples you love - save them for reference
3. **Sketch 3 Concepts** (10 min): Paper or digital - rough ideas, not perfection
4. **Pick and Refine** (10 min): Choose your strongest concept and polish it

**Fast-Track by Project Type**:
- **Logo**: Start with Section 4.1 (Logo Design) → Keep it simple!
- **Layout**: Jump to Section 2 (Layout Design) → Grid first, content second
- **Brand System**: Begin with Section 4 (Branding) → Define colors + fonts first
- **Infographic**: Focus on Section 5 (Data Viz) → Story before decoration

**Designer's Secret**: Constraints spark creativity. Set 2-3 rules (colors, fonts, shapes) and work within them.

**Quick Win**: Fill the Brand Foundation variables - they guide every design decision!
