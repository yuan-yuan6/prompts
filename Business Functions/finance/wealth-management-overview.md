# Wealth Management Program Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready you are to deliver a coherent wealth management program across client discovery, investment management, tax/retirement/estate planning, and protection/implementation.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess wealth management program readiness for [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]. Score readiness across foundation and investment execution, tax and retirement planning, estate and legacy readiness, risk and insurance coverage, implementation discipline, and governance/review cadence. Provide scores (1–5), key gaps, and the next 3 improvements.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Foundation (Goals, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet)
- 1: Inputs are incomplete; goals are vague.
- 3: Core inputs exist; prioritization and assumptions are partial.
- 5: Inputs and goals are complete, reconciled, and decision-linked.

2) Investment Strategy & Portfolio Governance
- 1: Allocation and implementation are inconsistent.
- 3: Policy exists; execution and rebalancing vary.
- 5: IPS-level policy and disciplined implementation with reporting.

3) Tax Planning & Account Coordination
- 1: Tax picture is unclear; account coordination is ad hoc.
- 3: Baseline tax view exists; some coordination.
- 5: Multi-year tax strategy with asset location and decision triggers.

4) Retirement Income & Distribution Readiness
- 1: Retirement is unmodeled; withdrawal decisions are reactive.
- 3: Projection exists; sequencing is partially defined.
- 5: Scenario-driven income plan with documented sequencing and triggers.

5) Estate & Legacy Readiness
- 1: Documents/beneficiaries are missing or stale.
- 3: Documents exist; alignment is incomplete.
- 5: Documents, titling, beneficiaries, and reviews are aligned.

6) Risk Protection & Implementation Discipline
- 1: Coverage gaps and weak follow-through.
- 3: Inventory exists; implementation tracking varies.
- 5: Protection posture and implementation tracker are disciplined and current.

## Deliverables
- Program summary (inputs, assumptions, key decisions, next actions)
- 3-part readiness rollup (scores + gaps + priorities)
- Action tracker (owners, dates, evidence)
- Review calendar (quarterly/semi-annual/annual) with triggers

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — decisions are case-by-case.
- Level 2: Documented — plans exist; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — consistent process for most cycles.
- Level 4: Managed — scenario-driven decisions and tracked execution.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from outcomes.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]
- [NET_WORTH_LEVEL]
- [PRIORITY_AREAS]
- [TIME_HORIZON]
- [ADVISOR_TEAM]
- [KEY_ASSUMPTIONS]
- [CONSTRAINTS]
- [REVIEW_CADENCE]

## Example (Condensed)
High net worth household with uneven documentation.
- Start: reconcile balance sheet and account map; confirm beneficiaries.
- Next: define IPS targets and tax-aware distribution sequencing.
- Execute: track actions and review quarterly with triggers.
