# Literature Review Project Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess your readiness to conduct a rigorous systematic review, meta-analysis, or evidence synthesis project across six critical dimensions: Methodological Expertise, Search & Selection Capability, Synthesis & Analysis Readiness, Infrastructure & Tools, Team & Resources, and Reporting & Dissemination Capacity. This framework identifies gaps, estimates timelines, and creates a project execution plan before committing to a multi-month review.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **literature review project readiness** for **{REVIEW_CONTEXT}** planning to conduct **{REVIEW_TYPE}**. Evaluate across: (1) **Methodological expertise**—what systematic review training exists? Experience with PRISMA, protocol registration, quality assessment tools? (2) **Search capability**—can the team design comprehensive searches across databases? Access to information specialists? (3) **Synthesis capacity**—what statistical and qualitative synthesis skills exist? Software proficiency (RevMan, R, NVivo)? (4) **Infrastructure**—what screening tools, reference management, and collaboration platforms are available? (5) **Team resources**—what time commitment, dual-reviewer capacity, and content expertise exists? (6) **Dissemination readiness**—what publication targets, stakeholder engagement plans, and knowledge translation capacity exists? Provide a maturity scorecard (1-5 per dimension), risk analysis, resource requirements, and a phased project plan with realistic timeline.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive literature review project readiness assessment for {REVIEW_CONTEXT}, a {REVIEW_TYPE} targeting {TARGET_OUTCOMES}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. METHODOLOGICAL EXPERTISE & TRAINING READINESS**
Evaluate whether the team possesses foundational systematic review methodology knowledge by assessing formal training in evidence synthesis methods, familiarity with reporting guidelines such as PRISMA or JBI standards, understanding of protocol development and registration processes through platforms like PROSPERO or OSF, experience with quality assessment frameworks including Cochrane Risk of Bias tools or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, knowledge of different review types and their methodological requirements such as distinguishing systematic reviews from scoping reviews or realist syntheses, and awareness of ethical considerations including conflict of interest management and transparent reporting practices that ensure methodological rigor throughout the review lifecycle.

**2. SEARCH STRATEGY & SELECTION CAPABILITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the team can design and execute comprehensive literature searches by assessing ability to formulate answerable questions using PICO or similar frameworks, capacity to design multi-database search strategies with appropriate Boolean operators and controlled vocabulary, access to information specialists or librarians with systematic review expertise, familiarity with grey literature sources and supplementary search methods including hand-searching and citation chasing, proficiency with reference management systems such as EndNote or Zotero for deduplication and organization, experience with dual independent screening workflows and inter-rater reliability calculation, and capacity to document search decisions and create PRISMA flow diagrams that demonstrate transparent study selection processes.

**3. SYNTHESIS & ANALYSIS CAPABILITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the team can conduct defensible evidence synthesis by assessing statistical expertise for meta-analysis including effect size calculation and heterogeneity assessment, proficiency with meta-analysis software such as RevMan, R metafor package, or Stata, qualitative synthesis skills including thematic analysis and framework synthesis methods, experience with data extraction form design and dual extraction with verification processes, capacity to assess publication bias through funnel plots or statistical tests, ability to conduct subgroup analyses and meta-regression when appropriate, mixed-methods integration capability for reviews combining quantitative and qualitative evidence, and understanding of when narrative synthesis is more appropriate than statistical pooling based on heterogeneity and data characteristics.

**4. INFRASTRUCTURE, TOOLS & WORKFLOW READINESS**
Evaluate whether adequate tools and systems support efficient review execution by assessing access to screening management platforms such as Covidence, Rayyan, or DistillerSR, availability of statistical software for quantitative synthesis and analysis, access to qualitative analysis software like NVivo or MAXQDA if needed, secure data storage and version control systems compliant with research data management requirements, collaboration platforms for team communication and task coordination such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, institutional database subscriptions and access to full-text articles, capacity for protocol registration and data sharing through repositories, and established workflows for quality control including audit trails and discrepancy resolution processes that ensure reproducibility and transparency.

**5. TEAM COMPOSITION, TIME & RESOURCE READINESS**
Evaluate whether the project has sufficient human and financial resources by assessing core team size with minimum two independent reviewers for screening and quality assessment, content expertise alignment with the review question domain, realistic time commitment estimation with typical systematic reviews requiring 300-1000+ person-hours depending on scope, availability throughout the project timeline spanning 6-18 months for complete reviews, budget allocation for database access, software licenses, publication fees and potential professional editing, access to methodological consultation or mentorship for complex synthesis decisions, stakeholder engagement capacity for co-production models when developing practice or policy guidance, and contingency planning for personnel changes or scope adjustments that may arise during long-duration projects.

**6. REPORTING, DISSEMINATION & IMPACT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the project can effectively communicate findings to target audiences by assessing publication strategy alignment with journal scope and impact including pre-identification of target journals, stakeholder identification and engagement planning for knowledge translation, capacity to produce multiple dissemination products including manuscripts, policy briefs, and plain language summaries tailored to diverse audiences, experience with reporting guideline compliance such as completing PRISMA checklists and providing supplementary materials, open science commitment including data sharing and protocol transparency, knowledge translation planning for implementation support beyond passive dissemination, impact measurement framework for tracking uptake and influence, and sustainability planning for review updates or living systematic reviews that maintain currency as new evidence emerges.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overall Readiness: 2.4/5.0 (Developing)
Maturity Level: Developing - Project feasible with structured support
Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO - Proceed with enhanced supervision and capability building
Top 3 Risks: (1) No information specialist access - search quality risk, (2) Limited meta-analysis experience - synthesis capacity gap, (3) Single researcher model - screening efficiency and bias concerns
Estimated Timeline: 10-14 months with current capacity

DIMENSION SCORECARD
| Dimension | Score | Strength | Gap | Priority Action |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----|-----------------|
| Methodological Expertise | 2.5/5.0 | Completed Cochrane training module | No hands-on review experience | Engage systematic review mentor |
| Search Capability | 2.0/5.0 | Database access via university | No information specialist collaboration | Schedule librarian consultation |
| Synthesis Capability | 2.3/5.0 | Strong quantitative background (stats coursework) | No RevMan or R meta-analysis experience | Complete R metafor tutorial, practice dataset |
| Infrastructure & Tools | 3.0/5.0 | University Covidence license available | No qualitative software if needed | Adequate for quantitative review |
| Team & Resources | 1.8/5.0 | Dissertation committee oversight | Single primary reviewer (no dual screening) | Recruit second reviewer (peer or RA) |
| Dissemination Readiness | 2.5/5.0 | Clear publication target (dissertation + journal) | No stakeholder engagement plan | Define practitioner dissemination strategy |

FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
- Scope: Appropriate for dissertation systematic review, question well-bounded by intervention type (gamification) and population (higher education)
- Volume Estimate: Expect 2,000-4,000 titles/abstracts to screen → 200-400 full texts → 20-40 included RCTs based on preliminary scoping
- Timeline Realism: 10-14 months realistic IF second reviewer secured and meta-analysis mentorship available; single-reviewer model would extend to 16-20 months with quality risks
- Resource Sufficiency: Database access adequate; Covidence license secures screening workflow; gap in meta-analysis software (need R or RevMan training); no budget identified for potential publication fees (~$2,000-3,000 open access)

RISK REGISTER
1. **Search Quality Risk** (Likelihood: High, Impact: High) - No information specialist collaboration risks incomplete database coverage and suboptimal search strings → Mitigation: Schedule consultation with education/health sciences librarian, pilot search with feedback, document search peer review
2. **Single-Reviewer Bias** (Likelihood: High, Impact: Medium) - Solo screening/extraction increases selection bias and error rate → Mitigation: Recruit second reviewer (fellow doctoral student reciprocal arrangement), implement 20% dual extraction for quality check, use Covidence conflict resolution features
3. **Meta-Analysis Skill Gap** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High) - Limited hands-on experience risks methodological errors in pooling and heterogeneity assessment → Mitigation: Complete R meta-analysis course (Coursera/Cochrane), work through practice dataset with mentor feedback before actual analysis, consider statistician consultation for complex scenarios
4. **Timeline Pressure** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium) - Dissertation deadlines may compress quality assurance → Mitigation: Build 2-month buffer into timeline, define minimum viable scope (could reduce to narrative synthesis if meta-analysis timeline threatens graduation), monthly milestone check-ins with committee
5. **Scope Creep** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium) - Broad gamification definition could expand included studies unmanageably → Mitigation: Finalize operational definition in protocol, pilot eligibility criteria on 50 abstracts with committee review, register protocol to commit to scope boundaries
