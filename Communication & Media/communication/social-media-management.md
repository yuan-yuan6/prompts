# Social Media Management & Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver a **strategic, engaging, and measurable social media presence** that builds community, drives business outcomes, and protects brand reputation. Use this to diagnose gaps in strategy, content, engagement, and performance.

## Template

Conduct a social media management & strategy readiness assessment for {SOCIAL_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (engagement rate, follower growth, sentiment, conversion, response time).

**1) STRATEGY & PLATFORM SELECTION**
- Platform choices align to target audience behavior and content type
- Goals are clear and measurable (awareness, engagement, leads, support)
- Brand positioning and voice are defined and consistent
- Competitive landscape and differentiation are understood

**2) CONTENT STRATEGY & PLANNING**
- Content mix is balanced (educational, entertaining, promotional, conversational)
- Content calendar exists with themes, campaigns, and posting cadence
- Content is tailored per platform (format, tone, hashtags, length)
- User-generated content and co-creation are leveraged

**3) ENGAGEMENT & COMMUNITY BUILDING**
- Response SLAs exist (comments, DMs, mentions) and are met
- Community guidelines and moderation policies are clear
- Proactive engagement (not just reactive) builds relationships
- Influencer and advocate programs amplify reach

**4) BRAND VOICE & VISUAL IDENTITY**
- Brand voice (tone, language, personality) is documented and consistent
- Visual assets (colors, fonts, templates) are cohesive across platforms
- Accessibility standards are met (alt text, captions, contrast)
- Approvals and quality control prevent off-brand content

**5) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT & OPTIMIZATION**
- KPIs are tracked (reach, engagement, sentiment, conversions, ROI)
- A/B testing informs content and timing optimization
- Analytics dashboards provide real-time visibility
- Insights drive strategy iteration and resource allocation

**6) CRISIS MANAGEMENT & REPUTATION PROTECTION**
- Social listening tools monitor brand mentions and sentiment
- Crisis escalation paths and response protocols are defined
- Negative feedback is addressed promptly and empathetically
- Post-crisis analysis captures lessons and prevents recurrence

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (sporadic posting, low engagement, no strategy, reactive)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic presence, inconsistent content, limited measurement)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (strategic approach, regular posting, solid engagement)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high engagement, measured ROI, proactive community building)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, strong advocacy, predictable business impact)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {SOCIAL_CONTEXT}: Brand/org, target audience, current platforms/followers, content cadence
- {OBJECTIVES}: Awareness, engagement, leads, conversions, support, and reputation goals

- {OBJECTIVES}: Grow LinkedIn to 15K followers in 6 months, achieve 4% engagement rate, generate 50 qualified leads/month, maintain <2h response time, Net Promoter Score 8+/10.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $2K/month ad budget; no video production resources; legal approval required for customer stories; CEO posts ad hoc (sometimes off-brand).

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.8 (Developing)
- Performance: LinkedIn engagement 2.1% (goal 4%), Twitter 1.8%, Instagram 3.2%; lead gen 18/month (goal 50)
- Top improvements: (1) increase posting to 5x/week with video, (2) formalize engagement SLA, (3) launch employee advocacy program

**5) ENGAGEMENT & RESPONSE PLAYBOOK**
