# Clinical Trial Protocol Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to draft and execute a clinical trial protocol with clear endpoints, operational feasibility, participant safety, and regulatory compliance.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess clinical trial protocol readiness for trial [TRIAL]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Objectives & endpoints, (2) Study design & eligibility, (3) Operational feasibility, (4) Safety monitoring, (5) Data management & analysis plan, (6) Regulatory & governance. Provide a scorecard and protocol checklist.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objectives & Endpoints
- 1 — Initial: Objectives vague; endpoints unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Primary/secondary endpoints defined; success criteria documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Endpoints are well-justified; aligned to clinical relevance and decisions.

### 2) Study Design & Eligibility
- 1 — Initial: Design inconsistent; eligibility criteria incomplete.
- 3 — Defined: Design and eligibility criteria documented; rationale provided.
- 5 — Optimized: Design is robust; bias minimized; feasibility validated.

### 3) Operational Feasibility
- 1 — Initial: Site recruitment and logistics unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Operational plan for sites, recruitment, and timeline.
- 5 — Optimized: Feasibility is strong with contingency plans and monitoring.

### 4) Safety Monitoring
- 1 — Initial: Safety plan incomplete; escalation unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Safety monitoring plan and reporting pathways defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Safety operations are mature with strong oversight and rapid response.

### 5) Data Management & Analysis Plan
- 1 — Initial: Data and analysis plan unclear; integrity risks high.
- 3 — Defined: Data collection, QC, and analysis plan defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Data integrity is strong; analysis is reproducible and auditable.

### 6) Regulatory & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Regulatory pathway unclear; governance missing.
- 3 — Defined: Regulatory and governance plan; approvals and roles defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance supports audits; compliance is consistent across sites.

## Deliverables
- Protocol readiness scorecard and risk register
- Protocol outline with endpoints and eligibility
- Operational feasibility plan (sites/recruitment)
- Safety monitoring and escalation plan
- Data management + analysis plan and governance checklist

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [TRIAL]: Trial name
- [ENDPOINTS]: Endpoints
- [ELIGIBILITY]: Eligibility
- [SITES]: Sites
- [SAFETY]: Safety plan
- [REGULATORY]: Regulatory requirements

## Example (Condensed)
- Trial: Phase II study with primary endpoint response rate
- Scores (1–5): Endpoints 3; Design 2; Feasibility 2; Safety 3; Data/Analysis 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Finalize eligibility and site plan; strengthen data QC and analysis plan; confirm regulatory pathway and governance cadence
