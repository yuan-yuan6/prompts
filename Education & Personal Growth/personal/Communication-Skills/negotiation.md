## Example

### Input
```
NEGOTIATION_TYPE: "Salary negotiation for senior software engineer position"
COUNTERPART: "Hiring manager at mid-sized tech company (200 employees, Series B funded)"
SUBJECT: "Base salary, equity, signing bonus, and remote work terms"
```

### Output
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overall Readiness: 3.6/5 (Prepared)
Negotiation Strength: Moderate-Strong position with preparation gaps

Top 3 Leverage Points:
1. Multiple competing offers creating strong BATNA
2. Specialized skills in demand (machine learning + infrastructure)
3. Hiring manager's timeline pressure (team launch in 6 weeks)

Top 3 Gaps:
1. Insufficient research on company's equity structure and typical grants
2. Unclear on acceptable base salary floor (range too wide)
3. No practiced script for handling pushback on remote work

Recommended Stance: Collaborative with confident anchoring—strong position but relationship matters for long-term success

DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding | Priority Actions |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Preparation & Research | 3.5/5 | Strong market research but equity comp data incomplete | Research typical equity grants for senior roles at Series B (use Carta, Holloway guides) |
| Goal Clarity & BATNA | 4.5/5 | Multiple offers create strong BATNA; walk-away point clear | Refine acceptable floor: $160K minimum or walk to alternative offers |
| Value Proposition | 4.0/5 | Unique ML+infra combo is differentiated; have proof points | Prepare 2-3 specific examples of past impact with metrics |
| Communication Strategy | 3.0/5 | Have opening number but no objection scripts or concession plan | Practice responses to common pushbacks; map concession trades |
| Emotional Intelligence | 3.5/5 | Can build rapport but may show discomfort with silence/pushback | Practice staying calm during pushback; rehearse silence after asks |
| Tactical Execution | 3.0/5 | Good on timing but weak on multi-item bundling and trade-offs | Prepare "if-then" bundles: "If equity lower, then signing bonus" |

NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

**Opening Position:**
"Based on my research into senior engineer compensation at Series B companies and the specialized combination of ML and infrastructure expertise I bring, I'm looking for a package of $185K base, 0.15% equity, $30K signing bonus, and fully remote work with quarterly team on-sites. Let me walk through how I arrived at these numbers..."

**Anchoring Approach:** High anchor with value-based justification
- Start above ideal ($185K) to create negotiation room
- Justify with market data + unique value + competing offers
- Frame as "package" not individual line items (harder to pick apart)

**Concession Plan (Prioritized trade-offs):**
1. **First concession:** Signing bonus reduction ($30K → $20K) if base holds
2. **Second concession:** Base reduction ($185K → $175K) if equity increases (0.15% → 0.20%)
3. **Third concession:** Remote flexibility (fully remote → 1 week/month on-site) if comp holds
4. **Fourth concession:** Start date flexibility (2 weeks → 3 weeks) if final package acceptable
5. **Hold firm:** Minimum $160K base, 0.12% equity, 90%+ remote work—below this, walk to alternative offer

**Red Lines (Non-negotiable walk-aways):**
- Base below $160K (market rate for senior roles is $150-180K; you have alternatives)
- Less than 80% remote work (lifestyle requirement; alternative offers have full remote)
- No equity (standard for all senior+ roles at startups)
- Non-compete > 6 months in geography (limits future mobility)

**Win-Win Options (Creative solutions):**
1. **Performance-based escalators:** Lower base year 1 ($170K) with guaranteed raise to $185K after 6-month review if hitting milestones
2. **Deferred signing bonus:** $15K now, $15K at 6 months (helps their cash flow, still gets you $30K)
3. **Equity vest acceleration:** Standard 4-year vest but with 6-month cliff instead of 1-year (shows confidence in you)
4. **Project selection:** Lower signing bonus but guaranteed ownership of ML infrastructure roadmap (career value)
5. **Referral bonus:** Lower signing bonus but $5K per successful senior hire you refer (helps them solve hiring problem)

CONVERSATION SCRIPT

**OPENING (Rapport + Confident Ask):**
"Thanks for the offer—I'm really excited about the ML infrastructure challenges you outlined and the team's direction. I've been thinking through the role and the comp package, and I'd like to discuss adjustments to make this work for both of us.

Based on my research into senior engineer compensation at Series B companies—I looked at Levels.fyi data, talked to engineers at similar-stage companies, and considered my specialized ML+infrastructure background—I'm looking for a total package of $185K base, 0.15% equity, $30K signing bonus, and fully remote work with quarterly on-sites.

Let me walk through how I got there..."

**JUSTIFICATION (Data + Value):**
"On base salary: The market range for senior engineers at Series B companies in this space is $150K-$190K. With my ML background—which is harder to hire for—and the infrastructure expertise you mentioned was a gap on the team, I'm positioning at the higher end. Plus, I have two other offers at $175K and $180K that I'm considering.

On equity: Standard grants for senior engineers at this stage are 0.10%-0.20% according to Holloway's equity guide. At 0.15%, I'm in the middle, which feels fair given the early-stage risk.

On signing bonus: I need to turn down another offer where I would have received a year-end bonus of $25K, so the $30K signing bonus offsets that opportunity cost.

On remote work: My most productive work happens when I can deep-focus from my home setup, and the quarterly on-sites would give us the collaboration time for planning and team bonding."

**HANDLING PUSHBACK:**

*Pushback: "That's higher than our budget for this role."*
Response: "I understand budget constraints. Can you help me understand what the budget was set at and what drives it? Is it market data, internal equity with current team, or something else? I want to make sure I understand the full picture so we can find something that works for both of us."

[Listen to their reasoning]

"Here's what I'm thinking: What if we structure it differently? For example, if the base is challenging, could we look at a higher equity grant or a performance-based raise after 6 months? I'm flexible on how we get there—what's most important is that the total package reflects the value I'll be bringing."

*Pushback: "We need someone in the office more than quarterly."*
Response: "I appreciate that concern. Can you help me understand what specific needs drive that? Is it real-time collaboration, mentoring junior engineers, or something else?"

[Listen]

"What if we commit to monthly on-sites for the first 3 months to build relationships and establish workflows, then reassess? If remote is working well—measured by delivery milestones and team feedback—we shift to quarterly. If it's not, we find a middle ground. That way we test the approach with clear metrics rather than guessing upfront."

**FINDING MIDDLE GROUND:**
"It sounds like we're a bit apart on [specific item]. Let me throw out some options and see what might work:

Option 1: If base salary of $185K is challenging, what if we did $175K base with 0.20% equity instead of 0.15%? That shifts more to the upside, which aligns with my belief in the company.

Option 2: If the $30K signing bonus is tough on cash flow, what about $15K now and $15K at my 6-month mark? That spreads it out but still gets me the total.

Option 3: [Third creative option based on their constraints]

What sounds most feasible from your side? Or is there another structure I'm not thinking of?"

**CLOSING (Securing Agreement):**
"This feels like a package we can both be excited about. Just to confirm, we're aligned on [repeat negotiated terms]: $X base, Y% equity with [vesting terms], $Z signing bonus paid on [schedule], and [remote work terms]. 

What's the next step to make this official? Do you need to check with [appropriate stakeholder], or can we move forward with offer letter revisions today?

I'm really looking forward to joining and starting on the ML infrastructure roadmap we discussed. Thanks for working with me on this."

TACTICAL PLAYBOOK

**PRE-NEGOTIATION (24 hours before):**
1. **Final research:** Double-check equity data on Carta Equity Benchmark, confirm competing offers still open
2. **Mental rehearsal:** Practice opening statement out loud 3 times; visualize handling pushback calmly
3. **Environment setup:** If video call, ensure good lighting, quiet space, notebook for notes
4. **BATNA reconfirmation:** Verify other offers still viable; know exactly what you'll do if you walk away
5. **Energy management:** Get good sleep, eat beforehand, avoid scheduling back-to-back meetings

**DURING NEGOTIATION (Key Tactics):**
1. **Anchor high first:** State your full ask before they counter—whoever anchors first often sets the range
2. **Use silence:** After stating your ask, stop talking. Let them respond. Silence feels uncomfortable but is powerful.
3. **Bundle items:** Negotiate the package, not line items ("I'm looking for X total comp" vs "I want Y salary")
4. **Flinch response:** When they make an offer, visible (but not exaggerated) surprise shows it's not acceptable
5. **"If-then" proposals:** "If you can do 0.20% equity, then I can accept $175K base" (conditional concessions)
6. **Defer to stakeholder:** "I need to check with [spouse/advisor]" buys time if you feel pressured
7. **Take notes visibly:** Shows professionalism; gives you excuse to pause and think

**STALEMATE BREAKERS (If Stuck):**
1. **Ask diagnostic questions:** "Help me understand what's making [item] difficult. Is it budget, internal equity, company policy?"
2. **Shift to interests:** "What if we step back—what are you trying to achieve with [constraint]? Maybe there's another way."
3. **Introduce new options:** "I haven't mentioned this yet, but what if we considered [creative alternative]?"
4. **Take a break:** "This is complex. What if we both think on it and reconnect tomorrow with fresh perspectives?"
5. **Reality check:** "Here's my situation: I have offers at X and Y. I prefer this role, but I need Z to make it work. Can you get there?"

**POST-NEGOTIATION:**
1. **Immediate:** Confirm agreement in writing via email that day ("Thanks for the discussion. To confirm: [terms]. I'll sign once I receive the updated offer letter.")
2. **Documentation:** Save all emails, take notes on verbal commitments (remote work terms, etc.)
3. **Relationship:** Send appreciation note to hiring manager for working through negotiation collaboratively
4. **Close alternatives:** Once you sign, promptly and professionally decline other offers with gratitude
5. **Start prep:** Begin researching team, tech stack, early projects to hit ground running

SUCCESS METRICS

**BEST CASE (Ideal Outcome):**
- Base salary: $185K
- Equity: 0.15% with standard 4-year vest
- Signing bonus: $30K paid on start date
- Remote work: Fully remote with quarterly on-sites (company-paid)
- Start date: 3 weeks out
- Relationship: Hiring manager respects your negotiation; excited for partnership

**GOOD CASE (Acceptable Compromise):**
- Base salary: $175K (10% concession from ask)
- Equity: 0.18% (20% increase from ask to offset base)
- Signing bonus: $20K (33% reduction but still offsets opportunity cost)

- Start date: 2 weeks out (slight flexibility)
- Relationship: Professional negotiation; mutual respect established

**WALK-AWAY POINT (Minimum Acceptable):**
- Base salary: Below $160K → Walk to alternative offers at $175K+ and $180K+
- Equity: Below 0.12% → Not aligned with Series B market standards; shows lack of value recognition
- Remote work: Requiring >2 days/week in office → Lifestyle non-negotiable; other offers have full remote
- Non-compete: >6 months in geography → Unacceptable future mobility limitation

**RELATIONSHIP OUTCOME:**
- Priority: Maintain positive relationship (this is your future manager and team)
- Success: Hiring manager views you as confident but collaborative, not adversarial
- Red flag: If negotiation becomes contentious, consider whether company culture fit is right
- Long-term: Strong negotiation now establishes respect; weak negotiation can lead to resentment
