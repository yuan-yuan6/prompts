# Recruitment Metrics & Optimization

## Purpose
Establish data-driven recruitment metrics, track performance, measure diversity outcomes, and continuously optimize hiring processes for efficiency and quality.

## Quick Recruitment Metrics Prompt
Optimize recruiting for [company] hiring [X annually] with [Y recruiters]. Metrics: time-to-fill (current [X] → target [Y] days), cost-per-hire ($[X] → $[Y]), quality of hire, source effectiveness. Diversity: [goals]. Baselines: [X months] data. Tracking: [ATS/dashboard]. Reviews: [monthly]. Identify: bottlenecks, top sources, improvement actions. ROI: [efficiency gains].

## Quick Start
1. **Identify Key Metrics** - Start with 3-5 core metrics: time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, quality of hire, and source effectiveness
2. **Establish Baselines** - Gather 3-6 months of historical data to understand current performance levels
3. **Set Realistic Targets** - Define improvement goals based on industry benchmarks and organizational capacity
4. **Implement Tracking Systems** - Configure your ATS or create dashboards to automatically capture and report metrics
5. **Review and Optimize** - Schedule monthly reviews to analyze trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven improvements

## Template

## 1. RECRUITMENT PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Efficiency Metrics

#### Time-to-Fill
**Definition:** Days from job requisition approval to candidate acceptance

**Calculation:**
```
Time-to-Fill = Acceptance Date - Requisition Approval Date
```

**Targets and Benchmarks:**

- Mid-level roles: 35-45 days
- Senior roles: 45-60 days
- Executive roles: 60-90+ days
- Industry-specific variations

**Tracking Approach:**
- By role level and department
- By location and remote vs. on-site
- By source of hire
- Trending over time (monthly, quarterly)
- Identify outliers and bottlenecks

#### Time-to-Hire
**Definition:** Days from candidate enters pipeline to offer acceptance

**Calculation:**
```
Time-to-Hire = Acceptance Date - Application Date
```

**Stage Breakdown:**
- Application to screening: ___ days

- Final interview to offer: ___ days
- Offer to acceptance: ___ days

**Optimization Opportunities:**
