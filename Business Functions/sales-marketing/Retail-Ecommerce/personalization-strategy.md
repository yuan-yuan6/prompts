# Personalization Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver personalization that improves conversion and retention through reliable data, decisioning, content, experimentation, and governance.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess personalization readiness for [BUSINESS] across [CHANNELS] with goal [CONVERSION_LIFT]% conversion lift. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Use-case selection & strategy, (2) Data & identity, (3) Decisioning & rules/models, (4) Content/creative system, (5) Experimentation & measurement, (6) Governance & operations. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Use-Case Selection & Strategy
- 1 — Initial: Personalization is random; no prioritized use cases.
- 3 — Defined: Use cases prioritized by value and feasibility; objectives defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Use cases are sequenced and scaled; ROI is predictable.

### 2) Data & Identity
- 1 — Initial: Data is fragmented; identity resolution is weak.
- 3 — Defined: Core events and profiles; basic identity stitching; QA routines.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted and timely; supports advanced decisioning.

### 3) Decisioning & Rules/Models
- 1 — Initial: Rules are ad-hoc; hard to maintain.
- 3 — Defined: Decisioning approach documented; rules and fallback logic exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Decisioning is optimized; models/rules are governed and calibrated.

### 4) Content/Creative System
- 1 — Initial: Content variants missing; creative bottlenecks prevent iteration.
- 3 — Defined: Modular content system; templates and variants by segment.
- 5 — Optimized: Creative scales; variants are generated and tested efficiently.

### 5) Experimentation & Measurement
- 1 — Initial: No control groups; impact unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Testing plan; KPI definitions; basic attribution assumptions.
- 5 — Optimized: Incrementality methods mature; optimization improves outcomes over time.

### 6) Governance & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; changes are risky.
- 3 — Defined: Owners, review process, and guardrails defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations scale; governance enables speed with safety.

## Deliverables
- Personalization readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Prioritized personalization use-case roadmap
- Data/event tracking and identity plan
- Decisioning logic (rules/models) with guardrails
- Experimentation plan with measurement framework

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [CHANNELS]: Web, email, app, ads
- [CONVERSION_LIFT]: Target lift
- [USE_CASES]: Recommendations, next-best-action, lifecycle triggers
- [DATA_SOURCES]: Web/app events, CRM, transactions
- [PRIVACY_CONSTRAINTS]: Consent/retention constraints

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: E-commerce brand adding personalized email and onsite recommendations
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Data 2; Decisioning 2; Content 2; Measurement 2; Ops 2
- 90-day priorities: Fix tracking; define top 3 use cases; build content variants; implement experiments with controls
