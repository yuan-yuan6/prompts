# Travel Planning Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive travel plans including itineraries, research, and budgets to ensure memorable, well-organized, and cost-effective travel experiences.

## Quick Start

Planning your next trip? Get organized in 30 minutes with this streamlined approach:

1. Set your budget first: Decide how much you can spend total, then allocate 40% for accommodation, 30% for activities, 20% for food, 10% for unexpected expenses
2. Book the big three: Secure flights, accommodation, and any must-do activities first—everything else is flexible
3. Create a simple daily rhythm: Plan one major activity per day, leaving afternoons or evenings flexible for spontaneous discoveries
4. Check the essentials: Passport validity, visa requirements, travel insurance, and any required vaccinations
5. Use the 3-2-1 packing rule: Three tops, two bottoms, one pair of shoes per week (you'll wear less than you think)

Pro tip: Download offline maps of your destination and save important confirmations as screenshots—you won't always have internet access when you need them most.
