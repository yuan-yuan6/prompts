## Template

Design motion graphics project for {PROJECT_TYPE} serving {AUDIENCE} with {DURATION} across {PLATFORMS}.

**VISUAL CONCEPT AND STYLE DEVELOPMENT**

Define animation aesthetic matching brand personality and audience expectations. Clean modern style uses geometric shapes, limited color palette (3-5 colors), sans-serif typography, and smooth transitions suitable for tech or B2B brands establishing trust through simplicity. Playful dynamic style employs organic shapes, vibrant gradients, hand-drawn textures, and bouncy movements appropriate for consumer lifestyle or youth-focused content. Corporate professional style features muted tones, subtle animations, data visualizations, and conservative timing serving financial services or enterprise audiences valuing sophistication over flash.

Establish color treatment balancing visual impact with brand consistency. Full-color approach uses complete brand palette throughout animation maintaining maximum brand recognition and visual energy. Accent-color strategy employs neutral base (grays, whites) with selective brand color highlights drawing attention to key moments without overwhelming. Monochromatic treatment uses single-color gradations creating sophisticated minimalist aesthetic suitable for luxury positioning or technical subjects requiring focus over decoration.

Design typography approach ensuring readability while supporting message hierarchy. Large bold headlines (80-120pt at 1080p) communicate primary messages holding screen 3-4 seconds for comprehension. Supporting text (40-60pt) provides context appearing briefly (2-3 seconds) avoiding information overload. Kinetic typography animates individual characters or words emphasizing specific points through scale changes (120-150% growth), subtle rotation (3-5 degrees), or color shifts. Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum between text and background meeting WCAG AA accessibility standards.

Develop illustration or photography integration strategy. Vector illustration provides infinite scalability and clean aesthetic enabling smooth morphing and shape-based transitions ideal for abstract concepts or brand mascots. Photography integration grounds content in reality using masked cutouts, color grading matching illustration palette, and subtle parallax creating dimension. Mixed media combines approaches allocating photography for human connection or product demonstration while using illustration for explanatory diagrams or abstract representations.

**ANIMATION TECHNIQUE AND MOVEMENT STYLE**

Select animation technique matching project scope and visual goals. 2D animation using After Effects or similar tools provides versatility, rapid iteration, and cost-effectiveness suitable for 80% of motion graphics projects. 3D animation adds dimensional depth, realistic lighting, and premium feel justifying 3-5x production time for product showcases, architectural visualization, or high-end brand content. Stop-motion or mixed media creates distinctive handcrafted aesthetic differentiating brand through unique visual language at expense of production efficiency.

Define movement personality reflecting content tone and pacing requirements. Fluid smooth movements use gradual acceleration and deceleration (ease-in-out curves at 70-80%) creating elegant organic feel appropriate for wellness, luxury, or storytelling content. Snappy dynamic movements employ quick accelerations with sharp stops (ease curves at 40-50%) communicating energy and modernity suitable for tech products, sports, or youth brands. Mechanical precise movements feature linear timing or subtle easing (20-30%) emphasizing technical accuracy for data visualization, engineering, or process explanations.

Establish timing rhythm balancing viewer comprehension with engagement. Fast-paced rhythm moves elements every 0.3-0.5 seconds maintaining high energy for social media (15-30 second runtime) targeting attention-deficit environments. Moderate pacing holds key visuals 1-2 seconds allowing processing while preventing boredom suitable for explainer videos (60-90 seconds) requiring information retention. Slow contemplative timing extends holds to 2-4 seconds creating premium feel for luxury brands or emotional storytelling where impact matters more than efficiency.

Design transition vocabulary creating visual continuity between scenes. Use consistent 2-3 transition types throughout project avoiding random variety undermining coherence. Wipe transitions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) imply directional progression suitable for step-by-step processes or chronological narratives. Morph transitions transform shapes or objects suggesting conceptual relationships between ideas. Fade transitions provide neutral punctuation between unrelated concepts. Scale transitions zoom into or out from details emphasizing connections between macro and micro perspectives.

**SCENE BREAKDOWN AND STRUCTURE**

Plan scene sequence establishing clear narrative progression. Opening scene (3-5 seconds) captures attention through bold visual, unexpected movement, or intriguing question establishing context. Development scenes (40-70% of runtime) deliver core content using logical progression: problem identification, solution explanation, benefit demonstration. Closing scene (5-8 seconds) reinforces key message and provides call-to-action with brand logo, contact information, or next-step guidance.

Define individual scene composition balancing information density with visual clarity. Simple single-focus scenes present one concept per screen using large central element surrounded by whitespace maximizing comprehension for complex ideas. Multi-element scenes coordinate 2-4 visual components through spatial hierarchy (size, position, color) and temporal sequencing (staggered animation timing) enabling efficient information delivery without overwhelming. Maintain consistent compositional logic throughout project: centered for importance, left-to-right for progression, top-to-bottom for hierarchy.

Establish scene duration matching content complexity and audience processing speed. Simple concept introductions (logo, title card, single statistic) require 2-3 seconds providing recognition without boredom. Moderate complexity content (comparison chart, process diagram, short paragraph) needs 4-6 seconds allowing reading and comprehension. Complex information (detailed data visualization, multi-step process, extended copy) demands 7-10 seconds respecting viewer cognitive load while maintaining momentum.

Plan visual element progression creating satisfying arc. Build complexity gradually starting simple and adding detail rather than presenting everything simultaneously. Use reveal techniques: mask animations uncover information directionally, scale animations grow elements from small to full size, opacity animations fade in sequentially. Reserve most visually impressive moments for 60-70% through animation creating climax before resolution rather than front-loading interest then declining into anticlimax.

**AUDIO INTEGRATION AND SYNCHRONIZATION**

Select music approach reinforcing emotional tone and pacing structure. Licensed music from royalty-free libraries (Epidemic Sound, Artlist) provides professional quality at $15-30/month subscription suitable for most projects. Custom composition offers unique sonic branding and perfect timing alignment justifying $500-3,000 cost for signature brand content or campaigns requiring differentiation. Ensure music tempo (BPM) aligns with animation rhythm: 100-120 BPM for moderate pacing, 120-140 BPM for energetic content, 80-100 BPM for contemplative mood.

Design sound effects enhancing movement and emphasizing key moments. Subtle whoosh sounds (200-400 Hz) accompany transitions between scenes. Pop or snap sounds (2-4 kHz) punctuate element appearances or text reveals. Bass hits (60-120 Hz) emphasize important moments or brand logos. Limit sound effect density to 50-70% of visual events avoiding constant audio fatigue. Balance sound effect volume at 30-40% of music level maintaining support role versus distraction.

Implement audio-visual synchronization creating unified rhythmic experience. Mark musical beats in timeline identifying natural emphasis points for visual changes. Align major scene transitions to musical phrases (typically every 4 or 8 beats) creating satisfying synchronization. Time text reveals or element appearances to individual beats maintaining consistent rhythm. Use waveform visualization ensuring critical visual moments align with audio peaks not valleys.

Plan voiceover integration when narration supports comprehension. Write conversational scripts avoiding formal written tone: use contractions, shorter sentences (8-12 words), active voice, and direct address. Budget 140-160 words per minute for comfortable delivery pace. Leave 0.5-1 second gaps between major sections providing visual-only breathing room. Record professional voice talent ($150-500 per finished minute) for brand content or use AI voices for internal communications where authenticity matters less than budget.

**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERY**

Set resolution and aspect ratio matching primary distribution channel. Horizontal 1920x1080 (16:9) serves website headers, YouTube, presentations covering majority of use cases. Vertical 1080x1920 (9:16) optimizes for Instagram Stories, TikTok, mobile-first consumption. Square 1080x1080 (1:1) balances mobile and desktop for Instagram feed, LinkedIn, performing across multiple placements. Consider rendering multiple aspect ratios from same source project adapting composition for each format rather than one-size-fits-all compromise.

Choose frame rate balancing smoothness, file size, and aesthetic expectations. 24fps provides cinematic feel with slightly choppy motion blur acceptable for narrative content and brand films. 30fps offers smoother playback suitable for explainer videos, tutorials, screen recordings where clarity matters more than cinematic aesthetic. 60fps enables ultra-smooth motion for gaming content, sports, or technical demonstrations requiring motion clarity. Avoid mixing frame rates within single project creating inconsistent viewing experience.

Define compression and export settings optimizing quality and file size. Export H.264 codec at variable bitrate (VBR) 8-12 Mbps for 1080p balancing quality and reasonable file sizes (30-second animation: 25-40MB). Use two-pass encoding for improved quality consistency especially for content with variable complexity. Set audio to 192-256 kbps AAC providing broadcast-quality sound. Include ProRes or uncompressed exports for archival enabling future re-editing without generation loss.

Implement accessibility features ensuring inclusive viewing. Add closed captions for all dialogue, voiceover, and key sound effects using white text on semi-transparent black background at 48-60pt size. Provide audio descriptions narrating visual-only information during natural pauses for vision-impaired audiences. Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum) enabling low-vision viewing. Consider reduced-motion version removing rapid movements for users with vestibular disorders.
