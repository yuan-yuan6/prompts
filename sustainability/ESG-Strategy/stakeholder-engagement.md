# Stakeholder Engagement & Mapping Template

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategy that identifies, prioritizes, and engages key stakeholders on ESG issues, incorporates stakeholder perspectives into strategy and decision-making, builds trust through transparent communication, and creates shared value.

## Quick Start

**Need stakeholder engagement strategy quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Mid-size manufacturing company
Key Stakeholders:
- Investors (High influence/interest): Quarterly ESG updates, annual roadshow
- Employees (High interest): Monthly town halls, ESG ambassadors program
- Customers (Medium): Sustainability webpage, product transparency
- Suppliers (Medium): Annual survey, capacity-building workshops
- Community (Medium): Quarterly meetings, local partnerships

Engagement Priorities:
1. Investor ESG data requests - respond within 2 weeks
2. Employee sustainability champions - 50 volunteers across sites
3. Customer sustainable product inquiries - dedicated ESG sales support
Quick Win: Stakeholder advisory panel (8 members, quarterly meetings)
```

### When to Use This
- Developing or refreshing ESG strategy (stakeholder input critical)
- Conducting materiality assessments (stakeholder perspectives needed)
- Managing ESG controversies or stakeholder concerns
- Building social license to operate in communities
- Improving ESG ratings through better stakeholder relations

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Stakeholder Mapping** - Identify and prioritize key stakeholders (1-2 weeks)
2. **Engagement Planning** - Design engagement approach for each group (2-3 weeks)
3. **Execute Engagement** - Implement communications and feedback mechanisms (ongoing)
4. **Integration & Response** - Incorporate insights into strategy and report back (ongoing)

## Best Practices

### Stakeholder Mapping
1. **Cast wide net initially** - Identify all potentially relevant stakeholders, prioritize later
2. **Use multiple dimensions** - Power, interest, influence, dependence, proximity
3. **Dynamic mapping** - Review annually; stakeholder importance shifts
4. **Intersectional view** - Individuals may represent multiple stakeholder groups
5. **Don't ignore low-power, high-interest** - Often early warning of emerging issues

### Engagement Design
1. **Match method to stakeholder** - One size doesn't fit all; tailor approach
2. **Go beyond one-way** - Listening and dialogue, not just broadcasting
3. **Create safe spaces** - Especially for critical feedback
4. **Make it meaningful** - Don't waste stakeholder time on token engagement
5. **Resource adequately** - Effective engagement requires investment

### Feedback Integration
1. **Close the loop** - Report back on what you heard and how you responded
2. **Be transparent on constraints** - Explain when cannot accommodate requests
3. **Show influence** - Demonstrate how stakeholder input shaped decisions
4. **Act on insights** - Engagement without action damages trust
5. **Feed materiality** - Use stakeholder input for materiality assessment

### Governance
1. **Clear ownership** - Who's responsible for each stakeholder relationship
2. **Executive involvement** - Not just delegated to sustainability team
3. **Coordinate internally** - Multiple departments engage same stakeholders
4. **Board oversight** - Board reviews stakeholder feedback and material issues
5. **Incentivize** - Link engagement to performance management

### Challenging Situations
1. **Engage early** - Don't wait for controversy; build relationships in good times
2. **Listen first** - Understand before defending
3. **Find common ground** - Even adversaries often share some interests
4. **Be honest** - Admit mistakes, limitations, dilemmas
5. **Follow through** - Commitments made in crisis must be kept

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Token engagement** - Checking box without genuine listening or influence on decisions
✅ Instead: Meaningful engagement where stakeholder input materially influences strategy

❌ **Defensive posture** - Viewing stakeholders as adversaries or compliance obligations
✅ Instead: See stakeholders as sources of insight, early warning, and partnership

❌ **One-way communication** - Broadcasting messages without listening
✅ Instead: Dialogue with genuine two-way exchange and feedback loops

❌ **Ignoring inconvenient feedback** - Cherry-picking input that confirms existing plans
✅ Instead: Welcome challenging perspectives; they often reveal blind spots

❌ **Engagement without action** - Listening but not acting on insights
✅ Instead: Demonstrate how stakeholder input influenced decisions; close the loop

❌ **Siloed engagement** - Different teams engaging same stakeholders inconsistently
✅ Instead: Coordinated approach with shared stakeholder relationship management

❌ **No metrics** - Unable to demonstrate engagement quality or impact
✅ Instead: Track reach, quality, satisfaction, and impact of engagement

❌ **Crisis-only engagement** - Only engaging stakeholders when issues arise
✅ Instead: Ongoing relationship building in good times to build trust

❌ **Homogeneous stakeholders** - Only engaging friendly, aligned stakeholders
✅ Instead: Include diverse perspectives, including critics and skeptics

❌ **Over-promising** - Making commitments unable to deliver to placate stakeholders
✅ Instead: Be realistic about constraints; build trust through honesty
