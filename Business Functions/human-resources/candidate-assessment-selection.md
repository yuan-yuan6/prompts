# Candidate Assessment & Selection Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to evaluate and select candidates consistently using structured criteria, fair processes, calibrated interviewers, and measurable hiring outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess candidate assessment readiness for [ROLE_FAMILY] hiring [HEADCOUNT] roles/quarter. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Role requirements & success profile, (2) Assessment design, (3) Interviewer training & calibration, (4) Fairness & compliance, (5) Decision process & documentation, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Role Requirements & Success Profile
- 1 — Initial: Role criteria are vague; selection relies on intuition.
- 3 — Defined: Success profile and competencies documented; rubric defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Profiles are validated by outcomes and refined regularly.

### 2) Assessment Design
- 1 — Initial: Assessments are inconsistent or irrelevant to role needs.
- 3 — Defined: Structured interviews and work samples aligned to competencies.
- 5 — Optimized: Assessments are predictive, efficient, and role-specific at scale.

### 3) Interviewer Training & Calibration
- 1 — Initial: Interviewers are untrained; scoring varies widely.
- 3 — Defined: Training and calibration sessions; scoring guidance exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Calibration is routine; signal quality is consistent across interviewers.

### 4) Fairness & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Bias risks unmanaged; documentation incomplete.
- 3 — Defined: DEI/fairness practices and compliance requirements documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Fairness is monitored; processes withstand audit and improve equity.

### 5) Decision Process & Documentation
- 1 — Initial: Decisions are opaque; debriefs are unstructured.
- 3 — Defined: Debrief format, decision rules, and documentation standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Decisions are fast, auditable, and consistently high quality.

### 6) Measurement & Continuous Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No feedback loop from hiring outcomes to process.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs tracked (time-to-hire, quality, pass-through); review cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves quality-of-hire and candidate experience.

## Deliverables
- Assessment readiness scorecard and prioritized gap list
- Role success profile and competency rubric
- Interview plan and work sample/assessment library
- Interviewer training and calibration cadence
- KPI dashboard and improvement backlog

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ROLE_FAMILY]: Role family (e.g., engineering, sales)
- [HEADCOUNT]: Hiring volume
- [COMPETENCIES]: Competency list
- [ASSESSMENTS]: Interviews, work samples, tests
- [QUALITY_OF_HIRE]: Quality-of-hire metric definition
- [TIME_TO_HIRE]: Time-to-hire target

## Example (Condensed)
- Hiring: 20 sales roles/quarter with inconsistent outcomes
- Scores (1–5): Profile 3; Design 2; Calibration 2; Fairness 3; Decisions 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize rubric + interview plan; train interviewers; implement KPI cadence and feedback loop
