```

### Template Variables

Templates use the format `[VARIABLE_NAME]` to indicate customizable fields:

```
Example prompt template:

Fill in:
- [PROJECT_TYPE]: "digital transformation"

## 🧭 Taxonomy & Validation

This repo uses a **canonical taxonomy** to keep categories and tags consistent across templates. A linter validates metadata on PRs and warns for missing or malformed front-matter.

Contributor tips & automation:

- Use `scripts/setup_env.sh` to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies
- Run `scripts/lint_metadata.py` to validate front-matter and metadata across the repository; it writes `metadata_lint_report.json` with issues/warnings
- After adding/removing templates, run `scripts/generate_index.py` to refresh `INDEX.md` and the summary counts
- Run `scripts/link_validator.py` to detect broken inter-template links and optionally generate `scripts/fix_broken_links.sh` for review
- Open a PR with your new template and include example variables/use cases for reviewers

See `TAXONOMY.md` and `scripts/taxonomy.json` for canonical values and front-matter rules.

### Metadata linter & common failures

The repository includes a metadata linter that checks YAML front-matter for required fields and canonicals. Common causes for linter issues include:

- Missing YAML front-matter or improperly formatted front-matter — ensure the file starts with a YAML `---` block and is valid YAML
- YAML parsing errors resulting from unescaped colons or other characters in `title` — quote titles that include `:` or use `|` multiline values
- Missing required fields: `title`, `category`, `last_updated` are mandatory. Add them if absent
- Missing or non-canonical tags — use the tags listed in `scripts/taxonomy.json`
- Path or filename issues — avoid uppercase letters or spaces in file or directory names

If you see failures from `scripts/lint_metadata.py`, fix the YAML and re-run the linter to confirm.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start Specific
Be as specific as possible when filling in variables. Generic inputs produce generic outputs.

**❌ Generic:**
```
[TARGET_AUDIENCE]: "customers"
[OBJECTIVE]: "improve sales"
```

**✅ Specific:**
```
[TARGET_AUDIENCE]: "Enterprise SaaS buyers, IT directors at 500+ employee companies"
[OBJECTIVE]: "increase demo-to-paid conversion by 25% in Q2"
```

### 2. Provide Context
Many templates have optional context fields - use them! More context leads to better results.

### 3. Iterate and Refine
Start with a template, get initial results, then refine variables based on output quality.

### 4. Combine Templates
Many templates work well together. For example:
- Use **Strategic Planning** → then **OKR Implementation**
- Use **Market Analysis** → then **Marketing Campaign**
- Use **Exploratory Analysis** → then **Predictive Modeling**

### 5. Customize for Your Domain
Most templates include customization sections. Adapt them to your specific industry or use case.
