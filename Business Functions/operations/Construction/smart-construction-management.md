# Smart Construction Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to use digital tools (BIM, field capture, analytics) to improve construction execution, quality, and safety.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess smart construction readiness for program [PROGRAM]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Use cases & value, (2) Data capture & BIM, (3) Tooling & integrations, (4) Field adoption, (5) Quality & safety controls, (6) Governance & scaling. Provide a scorecard and rollout roadmap.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Use Cases & Value
- 1 — Initial: Use cases unclear; value not measured.
- 3 — Defined: Use cases prioritized; KPIs defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Value is measured; scaling decisions based on results.

### 2) Data Capture & BIM
- 1 — Initial: BIM/data inconsistent; field capture limited.
- 3 — Defined: BIM standards and data capture plan; QA checks exist.
- 5 — Optimized: High-quality data supports reliable coordination and analytics.

### 3) Tooling & Integrations
- 1 — Initial: Tools are fragmented; data silos common.
- 3 — Defined: Core tools integrate; workflows documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Integrations are robust; upgrades managed without breaking workflows.

### 4) Field Adoption
- 1 — Initial: Adoption low; training missing.
- 3 — Defined: Training and SOPs exist; support model defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Adoption is high; workflows are embedded in daily operations.

### 5) Quality & Safety Controls
- 1 — Initial: Controls ad-hoc; issues found late.
- 3 — Defined: Digital checklists and inspections; issue tracking process.
- 5 — Optimized: Controls are proactive; issues prevented and learning is captured.

### 6) Governance & Scaling
- 1 — Initial: No ownership; pilots stall.
- 3 — Defined: Ownership, cadence, and roadmap defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Scaling is systematic across projects with consistent standards.

## Deliverables
- Smart construction readiness scorecard
- Use-case portfolio and KPI set
- BIM/data standards and capture plan
- Tooling/integration architecture
- Rollout roadmap with training and governance

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PROGRAM]: Program name
- [TOOLS]: Tools
- [BIM]: BIM standards
- [DATA_CAPTURE]: Data capture methods
- [KPIS]: KPIs
- [ROLLOUT]: Rollout plan

## Example (Condensed)
- Program: Field progress capture + issue tracking
- Scores (1–5): Value 2; Data 2; Integrations 2; Adoption 2; Controls 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Define KPIs; standardize BIM/data; integrate tools; train field teams and set governance cadence
