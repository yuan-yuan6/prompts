# Fashion Brand Strategy & Collection Development Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for fashion brand development, collection planning, trend forecasting, sustainable fashion practices, omnichannel retail strategy, and luxury/mass market positioning.

## Quick Fashion Brand Prompt
Develop fashion strategy for [brand name] in [market segment: luxury/contemporary/mass]. Plan [X] annual collections with [Y] SKUs per season. Price range: [entry-point to hero piece]. Define: brand DNA, target customer avatar, design aesthetic, and 3-year positioning roadmap. Include: collection calendar, category mix (RTW/accessories/footwear %), channel strategy, and initial capsule collection concept (15-20 pieces).

## Quick Start

**For Fashion Brands & Designers:**
1. **Define Your Brand DNA** - Start with Section 1 to articulate your unique design aesthetic, target customer profile, and market positioning
2. **Plan First Collection** - Use Section 2 to map out seasonal themes, piece counts, and price ranges for your initial launch
3. **Set Up Product Mix** - Reference Section 3 to balance revenue across categories (RTW, accessories, footwear)
4. **Choose Manufacturing** - Section 4 helps you select between in-house production, contract manufacturing, or hybrid approaches
5. **Launch Distribution** - Begin with 2-3 channels from Section 5 (e.g., flagship store + e-commerce + one marketplace)

**Quick Win:** Start with a capsule collection of 15-20 pieces in one category to test market response before full-scale launch.
