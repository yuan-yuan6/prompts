# Investment Evaluation Overview

## Purpose
Overview of comprehensive investment evaluation framework covering ROI analysis, NPV calculations, risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and performance measurement to support informed investment decisions and capital allocation optimization.

## Overview

Investment evaluation requires a systematic, multi-faceted approach combining financial analysis, risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and performance measurement. This framework provides a comprehensive methodology for evaluating investments and making optimal capital allocation decisions.

## Framework Components

### 1. ROI Analysis ([investment-roi-analysis.md](investment-roi-analysis.md))
**Focus:** Return calculation and profitability assessment
- Traditional ROI metrics and calculations
- Accounting-based returns (ROA, ROE)
- Advanced return metrics (Sharpe ratio, EVA, ROIC)
- Cash flow analysis and modeling
- Payback period and break-even analysis
- Scenario planning and sensitivity analysis

**Use when:** You need to calculate and analyze investment returns, evaluate profitability, or compare investment alternatives.

### 2. NPV and DCF Modeling ([npv-dcf-modeling.md](npv-dcf-modeling.md))
**Focus:** Discounted cash flow valuation and net present value
- Cash flow projection and forecasting
- WACC and discount rate determination
- Terminal value calculation
- NPV and IRR analysis
- Sensitivity and scenario analysis
- Real options and flexibility valuation

**Use when:** You need to create financial models, value investments using DCF methodology, or perform capital budgeting analysis.

### 3. Risk Assessment ([investment-risk-assessment.md](investment-risk-assessment.md))
**Focus:** Risk identification, quantification, and mitigation
- Market and competitive risk analysis
- Operational and execution risk evaluation
- Financial and capital structure risks
- Risk quantification and probability assessment
- Risk mitigation strategy development
- Risk monitoring and early warning systems

**Use when:** You need to assess investment risks, develop mitigation strategies, or ensure risks are within acceptable tolerance levels.

### 4. Portfolio Optimization ([portfolio-optimization.md](portfolio-optimization.md))
**Focus:** Capital allocation and portfolio construction
- Strategic asset allocation framework
- Portfolio optimization techniques
- Capital budgeting and resource allocation
- Multi-criteria decision analysis
- Portfolio rebalancing strategies
- Continuous optimization and improvement

**Use when:** You need to allocate capital across multiple investments, optimize portfolio composition, or balance risk and return at portfolio level.

### 5. Performance Measurement ([investment-performance-measurement.md](investment-performance-measurement.md))
**Focus:** Performance evaluation and attribution
- Return calculation and benchmarking
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics
- Attribution analysis (allocation and selection)
- Value creation and destruction analysis
- Performance reporting and insights
- Improvement recommendations

**Use when:** You need to evaluate investment performance, compare to benchmarks, understand value drivers, or report to stakeholders.

## Integrated Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
1. Define investment objectives and constraints
2. Conduct preliminary financial analysis (ROI, NPV)
3. Identify and assess key risks
4. Evaluate strategic fit and alignment

### Phase 2: Detailed Evaluation
1. Build comprehensive financial models (DCF)
2. Conduct thorough risk assessment
3. Perform sensitivity and scenario analysis
4. Evaluate portfolio fit and optimization
5. Calculate risk-adjusted returns

### Phase 3: Decision Making
1. Compare to investment criteria and hurdle rates
2. Assess risk-return profile vs. alternatives
3. Evaluate portfolio impact and optimization
4. Make go/no-go decision
5. Define monitoring and review framework

### Phase 4: Post-Investment Management
1. Monitor performance vs. projections
2. Track key risks and mitigation effectiveness
3. Conduct periodic performance attribution
4. Rebalance portfolio as needed
5. Capture lessons learned

## Key Decision Criteria

### Financial Criteria
- NPV > 0 (value creation)
- IRR > hurdle rate (exceeds required return)
- ROI meets or exceeds targets
- Acceptable payback period
- Positive economic value added (EVA)

### Risk Criteria
- Risks identified and quantified
- Risks within tolerance levels
- Effective mitigation strategies in place
- Downside scenarios acceptable
- Portfolio diversification maintained

### Strategic Criteria
- Alignment with strategic objectives
- Competitive advantage creation
- Capability and competency building
- Market position enhancement
- Long-term value creation potential

### Portfolio Criteria
- Optimal capital allocation
- Portfolio diversification
- Risk-return optimization
- Resource availability
- Execution feasibility

## Best Practices

### Analysis Quality
- Use multiple valuation methods and cross-check
- Test assumptions with sensitivity analysis
- Model multiple scenarios (base, optimistic, pessimistic)
- Include both quantitative and qualitative factors
- Benchmark against peers and alternatives

### Risk Management
- Identify risks systematically across all categories
- Quantify risks where possible with probability and impact
- Develop specific mitigation strategies for major risks
- Build contingency plans for downside scenarios
- Monitor risks continuously post-investment

### Portfolio Perspective
- Evaluate investments in portfolio context
- Consider diversification and correlation
- Optimize at portfolio level, not just individual investments
- Balance short-term and long-term investments
- Maintain strategic alignment across portfolio

### Decision Process
- Use structured, consistent evaluation framework
- Document assumptions and rationale clearly
- Involve appropriate stakeholders and expertise
- Separate evaluation from advocacy
- Learn from past decisions and outcomes

## Implementation Timeline

### Weeks 1-2: Framework Setup
- Define investment evaluation criteria
- Select analytical tools and templates
- Establish governance and decision process
- Train team on methodology

### Weeks 3-6: Analysis Phase
- Gather data and conduct research
- Build financial models
- Assess risks and develop mitigation plans
- Perform portfolio optimization analysis

### Weeks 7-8: Review and Decision
- Review analysis results
- Conduct stakeholder review and input
- Make investment decision
- Define implementation and monitoring plan

### Ongoing: Monitoring and Review
- Track performance vs. projections
- Monitor risks and mitigation effectiveness
- Conduct periodic reviews
- Update models and assumptions
- Capture and share learnings
