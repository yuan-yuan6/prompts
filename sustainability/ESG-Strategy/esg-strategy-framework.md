# ESG Strategy Framework Template

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy that integrates sustainability into business operations, meets stakeholder expectations, addresses regulatory requirements, and creates long-term value while managing risks and opportunities.

## Quick Start

**Need an ESG strategy quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Mid-size manufacturing company
ESG Vision: "Carbon neutral operations by 2040, zero waste by 2035, industry-leading workplace safety"
Priority Areas:
- Environmental: 50% emissions reduction by 2030, renewable energy transition
- Social: 40% diverse leadership by 2027, zero workplace injuries
- Governance: Full CSRD compliance, independent board sustainability committee
Quick Wins: LED lighting (20% energy savings), supplier code of conduct, ESG disclosure framework
3-Year Targets: Scope 1&2 emissions -30%, 25% diverse leadership, publish first CSRD report
```

### When to Use This
- Developing first ESG strategy or refreshing existing approach
- Responding to investor, customer, or regulatory ESG requirements
- Preparing for ESG reporting frameworks (CSRD, TCFD, GRI, SASB)
- Integrating sustainability into corporate strategy
- Addressing stakeholder pressure for ESG performance

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **ESG Materiality Assessment** - Identify material ESG issues for your business (2-3 weeks)
2. **Baseline & Gap Analysis** - Assess current performance vs. best practices (2-4 weeks)
3. **Strategy Development** - Set vision, goals, targets, and roadmap (4-6 weeks)
4. **Implementation Planning** - Define initiatives, resources, governance (3-4 weeks)
5. **Measurement & Reporting** - Establish metrics, monitoring, disclosure (2-3 weeks)

## Best Practices

### Strategy Development
1. **Start with materiality** - Focus on what matters most to business and stakeholders
2. **Set science-based targets** - Align climate targets with climate science (SBTi)
3. **Integrate, don't separate** - ESG should be part of business strategy, not parallel
4. **Balance ambition and realism** - Stretch goals that are credible and achievable
5. **Engage stakeholders early** - Build buy-in and incorporate diverse perspectives

### Governance
1. **Board accountability** - ESG oversight at board level with dedicated committee
2. **Executive ownership** - C-suite role (CSO) with authority and resources
3. **Link to compensation** - ESG metrics in variable pay for executives and beyond
4. **Cross-functional integration** - ESG champions in all business units
5. **Regular reporting** - Transparent communication on progress and challenges

### Target Setting
1. **Use absolute targets** - Not just intensity; show real emission/waste reductions
2. **Include Scope 3** - Value chain emissions often 80%+ of footprint
3. **Short and long-term** - 2025/2030 milestones plus 2040/2050 ambitions
4. **Sector-appropriate** - Use industry frameworks (SASB) for relevant metrics
5. **Third-party validation** - SBTi for climate, B Corp for holistic, certifications

### Implementation
1. **Quick wins first** - Build momentum with visible early successes
2. **Invest adequately** - ESG transformation requires real resources
3. **Build capabilities** - Train teams, hire expertise, implement systems
4. **Pilot and scale** - Test approaches before enterprise-wide rollout
5. **Celebrate progress** - Recognize achievements to maintain momentum

### Stakeholder Engagement
1. **Investor transparency** - Proactive disclosure, regular engagement, clear metrics
2. **Employee activation** - Make sustainability everyone's job, provide tools
3. **Customer collaboration** - Co-create sustainable solutions, demonstrate value
4. **Supply chain partnership** - Support suppliers' sustainability journey
5. **Community presence** - Local engagement, shared value creation

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **ESG as PR/marketing** - Superficial greenwashing without real change
✅ Instead: Substantive commitments with transparent measurement and accountability

❌ **Compliance-only mindset** - Doing minimum required by regulations
✅ Instead: See ESG as strategic opportunity and competitive advantage

❌ **Siloed sustainability team** - ESG isolated from business operations
✅ Instead: Integrate ESG into business strategy, operations, and decision-making

❌ **Vague commitments** - "We care about sustainability" without measurable goals
✅ Instead: Specific, measurable, time-bound targets with clear accountability

❌ **Cherry-picking easy wins** - Addressing minor issues while ignoring material topics
✅ Instead: Focus on material ESG issues with biggest impact on business and society

❌ **Unrealistic targets** - Net zero tomorrow without credible roadmap
✅ Instead: Ambitious but achievable targets with clear implementation pathway

❌ **Ignoring Scope 3** - Only measuring direct emissions (Scope 1&2)
✅ Instead: Measure and address full value chain (Scope 3 often 80%+ of footprint)

❌ **No stakeholder input** - Strategy developed in isolation
✅ Instead: Engage investors, customers, employees, suppliers, communities in strategy

❌ **Set and forget** - ESG strategy document that sits on shelf
✅ Instead: Living strategy with regular review, updates, and transparent progress reporting

❌ **Underinvesting** - Expect transformation without resources
✅ Instead: Allocate adequate budget, people, systems for real change
