# Content Strategy Framework for Digital Media

## Purpose
Create comprehensive content strategy frameworks for digital media organizations including audience analysis, editorial planning, multi-platform distribution, revenue models, and performance measurement to build sustainable journalism businesses and engaged communities in the digital landscape.

## Template

Create content strategy for {MEDIA_TYPE} ({AUDIENCE_SIZE} current reach, {REVENUE_MODEL} business model) targeting {AUDIENCE_SEGMENTS} achieving {GROWTH_GOALS} (pageviews/subscribers/revenue) over {TIMELINE_MONTHS} months with {TEAM_SIZE} editorial team and {BUDGET} annual budget.

**AUDIENCE STRATEGY**

Audience Segmentation—Demographics and Behavior: Primary audience (60-70% of traffic/revenue, core demographic 25-45 professionals, desktop + mobile consumption, willing to pay for quality), secondary audience (20-30%, adjacent demographics reach them differently, social media discovery primary, ad-supported acceptable), emerging audience (5-10%, future growth opportunity Gen Z younger skew, mobile-first video preference, build now for future revenue). Psychographic Profiling: Information seekers (depth and accuracy priority, long-form 1500+ words acceptable, expert sources credibility critical, subscription candidates high intent), entertainment seekers (shareable visual content, shorter 500-800 words scannable, social discovery primary, ad-supported model), community seekers (belonging and participation, comments and events engagement, newsletter intimate connection, loyal but smaller cohort). Consumption Patterns: Time of day (morning commute 6-9am peak mobile, lunch browsing 12-2pm desktop, evening deep-reads 7-10pm engaged sessions), platform preferences (60%+ mobile requires responsive design, desktop longer sessions higher conversion, app users most engaged install signals commitment), content formats (breaking news real-time alerts immediate, analysis/opinion thought leadership depth, features/investigations weekend consumption leisure time).

User Journey Mapping—Awareness to Advocacy: Discovery (social media/search/referral first touchpoint, homepage impression 3-5 seconds decide stay/bounce, headline + image + excerpt hook critical), first visit (1-3 articles typical session, navigation clarity aids exploration, email signup CTA 1-3% conversion baseline), regular reading (3+ visits/month habits forming, newsletter signup 20-30% of regulars, content variety maintains interest avoid niche fatigue), subscription consideration (paywall encounter decision point, value perception = content quality × frequency × uniqueness, free trial 30-60 days lowers risk), subscriber retention (80%+ annual retention goal, exclusive content reinforces value, community features build stickiness, churn analysis predicts at-risk).

Persona Development—Archetype Examples: "Policy Professional" (35-55, government/nonprofit, policy wonk, morning newsletter reader, will pay $10-15/month for insights, LinkedIn shares to network), "Engaged Citizen" (28-40, college-educated, civically active, evening/weekend reader, social shares common, potential subscriber if financially stable), "Industry Expert" (40-60, professional niche, seeks industry news, high intent for specialized content, will pay $20-50/month B2B pricing, event attendee). Content Customization: Personalization (topics followed, reading history, recommended content algorithmic, email digest preferences set by user), segmentation (free vs paid content gating, professional vs consumer tone adaptation, geographic/industry-specific variations).

**EDITORIAL FRAMEWORK**

Content Pillars—Strategic Themes: Pillar 1 Breaking News (30% of content volume, real-time coverage events/announcements, short-form 300-800 words, high frequency 5-15/day if news-focused, traffic driver SEO + alerts, low direct revenue but audience building), Pillar 2 Analysis/Commentary (25%, expert perspective differentiation, medium-form 1000-1500 words, 3-5/week sustainable, thought leadership positioning, subscription driver exclusive insights), Pillar 3 Investigative/Features (15%, original reporting high-impact, long-form 2500-5000+ words, 1-2/month resource-intensive, awards and reputation builder, member benefit exclusive access), Pillar 4 Service/Utility (20%, how-to guides explainers, evergreen 800-1500 words, SEO optimized, consistent traffic over time, affiliate revenue opportunities), Pillar 5 Community/Engagement (10%, reader stories UGC, medium-form 500-1000 words, belonging and participation, low production cost, retention and loyalty driver). Balance and Mix: Adjust percentages based on strategy (news orgs more breaking 50%+, niche pubs more analysis 40%+, community focus more engagement 30%+), resource constraints (investigative requires budget, breaking requires staffing, features require time), audience preference (analytics inform what performs, double down on engagement winners, cut underperformers).

Editorial Calendar—Planning Horizons: Annual themes (Q1 policy priorities, Q2 elections/campaigns, Q3 summer/travel, Q4 year-end retrospectives, tied to audience interests seasonal), monthly focus (deep-dive series spanning 4 weeks, special projects planned months ahead, guest contributors scheduled, events tied to content releases), weekly cadence (Monday newsletter recap weekend + week preview, Wednesday analysis mid-week depth, Friday features leisure reading, daily breaking as occurs), daily workflow (morning editorial meeting 9am story assignments, afternoon publishing 2-5pm traffic peak, evening social promotion, 24-hour cycle for news orgs).

Story Sourcing—Source Development: Official sources (government agencies, corporations, institutions, press releases starting point not endpoint, verify independently always), expert network (academics, researchers, industry insiders, cultivate relationships long-term, quick quotes + deep interviews), citizen/community sources (tips and leads, lived experience stories, verification critical, diverse perspectives), data sources (government databases, FOIA requests, leaked documents, analysis journalism, visualization and interactives), social media monitoring (trending topics, public sentiment, user-generated leads, verification paramount fake news risks). Editorial Standards: Accuracy (two-source rule for factual claims, corrections policy transparent, fact-checking for investigations, legal review for sensitive stories), fairness (multiple perspectives especially controversial, right of response to criticism subjects, avoid loaded language present facts), transparency (disclose conflicts of interest, explain methodology for data stories, correction and update policies public, source anonymity justified and explained).

**MULTI-PLATFORM DISTRIBUTION**

Website Strategy—Homepage Design: Hero section (1-3 top stories visual hierarchy, headline + image + excerpt, refresh 2-4x daily maintain freshness, mobile responsive hamburger menu), section navigation (clear categories avoid overwhelming, search function prominent, personalization if logged in, breadcrumbs aid navigation), content discovery (related articles algorithmic, trending/popular social proof, newsletter signups persistent CTA, category pages curated + algorithmic mix). Article Optimization: Load speed (<3 seconds Core Web Vitals, image compression + CDN, lazy loading below fold, paginated long-form optional but controversial UX vs ad revenue), readability (18-22px font size mobile legible, line height 1.5-1.8 scannable, paragraph breaks 2-4 sentences, pull quotes and images visual rhythm), engagement features (social share buttons prominent, save/bookmark for registered users, print/email/PDF for subscribers, comment section if moderated or off if toxic). SEO Foundation: Technical SEO (sitemap XML, robots.txt, structured data schema.org Article markup, HTTPS security), on-page SEO (title tags <60 chars keyword-optimized, meta descriptions 150-160 chars compelling, H1 once H2/H3 hierarchy, alt text images descriptive), content SEO (keyword research Ahrefs/Semrush, search intent match informational/navigational, internal linking 3-5 per article, E-E-A-T signals expertise/authority/trust/experience).

Email/Newsletter Strategy—List Segmentation: Daily digest (top 5-10 stories curated, morning delivery 6-8am commute timing, 20-30% open rate target, 2-5% click-through to site), weekly roundup (analysis + features in-depth, Friday/Sunday send leisure reading, 25-35% open rate deeper engagement, 10-15% click-through longer reads), breaking news alerts (opt-in only avoid spam, immediate delivery critical events, 40-50% open rate urgency, brief with link to full story), topic-specific (politics, business, culture separate lists, personalization preferences, 30-40% open rate high relevance, super-engaged subscribers). Email Best Practices: Subject lines (30-50 characters mobile truncation, curiosity gap without clickbait, A/B test variations, personalization "First Name," moderate improvement), from name (publication name or personal sender, consistency builds recognition, reply-to@ address monitored), design (mobile-first 60%+ mobile opens, single-column layout, CTA buttons not just links, plain text option for deliverability), frequency (daily max unless breaking, weekly minimum to stay top-of-mind, preference center let subscribers choose, honor unsubscribes immediately).

Social Media Strategy—Platform-Specific: Facebook (link posts with compelling excerpt + image, video native upload not YouTube links, groups for community, declining organic reach paid boost necessary, older demographics 35+), Twitter/X (real-time breaking news, threads for analysis 5-10 tweets, engagement reply to mentions, news junkie audience, journalists and influencers amplify), Instagram (visual storytelling quote graphics, behind-scenes Stories, Reels news explainers <60 seconds, younger demographics 18-35, less direct traffic but brand building), LinkedIn (professional/business content, long-form posts native, thought leadership, B2B audiences, article shares perform well), TikTok (emerging for news, short-form <60 second explainers, Gen Z reach, creative not corporate, experimental for traditional media), YouTube (video journalism/documentaries, longer-form 5-20 minutes, evergreen SEO value, ad revenue share, production cost higher). Social Best Practices: Posting frequency (1-3x daily Twitter news cycle, 1x daily Facebook/Instagram sustainable, 3-5x weekly YouTube quality over quantity), engagement (respond to comments 2-4 hours builds community, ask questions drive conversation, user-generated content reshare with credit), paid promotion (boost high-performing posts $20-100, target lookalike audiences, measure CPM/CPC not just reach, retarget website visitors).

Distribution: Podcast apps (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast primary, RSS feed universal, submit to directories, show notes with links), website embed (players on article pages, transcripts for SEO + accessibility, newsletter promotion, archive browsable), monetization (sponsorships $25-50 CPM for 5K+ downloads, dynamic ad insertion, premium ad-free for subscribers, affiliate revenue).
