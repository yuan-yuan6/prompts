# Intellectual Property Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to manage and protect intellectual property across six dimensions: Strategy & Portfolio, Protection & Maintenance, Trade Secrets & Confidentiality, Licensing & Monetization, Enforcement & Disputes, and Governance & Operations. Identify gaps, prioritize fixes, and produce an actionable capability plan.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **IP management readiness** for **[ORGANIZATION]** in **[INDUSTRY]** operating across **[JURISDICTIONS]** with **[IP_PORTFOLIO]** and **[IP_BUDGET]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Strategy & portfolio**—is there a clear offensive/defensive posture and filing priority model? (2) **Protection & maintenance**—are filings, renewals, and docketing controlled with quality and timelines? (3) **Trade secrets & confidentiality**—are secrets identified, classified, and access-controlled? (4) **Licensing & monetization**—is there discipline in deal selection, economics, and compliance with license obligations? (5) **Enforcement & disputes**—is monitoring, escalation, and outside counsel strategy defined? (6) **Governance & operations**—are roles, tooling, KPIs, and decision rights clear? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 12-month roadmap.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid readiness evaluation.

## Template

Conduct an IP readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating across {JURISDICTIONS} with {IP_PORTFOLIO} and an annual IP budget of {IP_BUDGET}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. STRATEGY & PORTFOLIO READINESS**
- IP strategy is explicit (offensive/defensive/balanced) and aligned to product strategy
- Filing priorities and coverage model exist (tech areas, geos, competitor landscape)
- Portfolio health is reviewed regularly (value, relevance, overlap, pruning decisions)
- Invention capture process exists (disclosures, incentives, review committee)
- M&A and partnerships implications are considered in IP posture

**2. PROTECTION, DOCKETING & MAINTENANCE READINESS**
- Docketing and deadlines are reliably managed (renewals, office actions, fees)
- Quality controls exist (claim strategy, prior art review, prosecution consistency)
- Trademark registration and renewals are controlled across key markets
- Recordkeeping is clean (assignments, inventorship, chain of title)
- International strategy is operationally feasible (local counsel, translations, cost control)

**3. TRADE SECRETS & CONFIDENTIALITY READINESS**
- Trade secrets are identified and classified (what is a secret, why it matters)
- Access controls and handling rules exist (need-to-know, tooling, logging)
- NDAs and confidentiality terms are standardized and actually used
- Employee/contractor onboarding and offboarding controls are defined
- Incident response exists for suspected leakage (containment, investigation, remediation)

**4. LICENSING & MONETIZATION READINESS**
- Licensing strategy is defined (targets, channels, exclusivity posture)
- Deal evaluation is disciplined (economics, strategic impact, grant-back risks)
- Compliance with license obligations is managed (reporting, audits, royalties)
- Open source and inbound license risks are handled (policies and review)
- IP valuation approach is defined for major deals and transactions

**5. ENFORCEMENT, MONITORING & DISPUTES READINESS**
- Monitoring exists (trademark watching, patent landscape, counterfeit detection)
- Escalation and decision rights exist (when to send letters, when to litigate)
- Evidence collection and preservation processes exist
- Outside counsel strategy is defined (panels, budgets, playbooks)
- Dispute learnings feed back into protection and contracting practices

**6. GOVERNANCE, OPERATING MODEL & METRICS READINESS**
- Roles are clear (IP counsel, business owners, engineering, security, HR)
- Budgeting cadence exists (forecast vs actual, ROI and cost control)
- Tooling supports the work (docketing, repository, workflow, reporting)
- KPIs are tracked (filing throughput, cost per filing, time-to-file, renewal misses)
- Policy set is current (trade secrets, inventions, OSS, licensing approvals)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities
2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension
3. **PORTFOLIO BASELINE** - Asset counts, top tech areas, key geos, renewal exposure
4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions
5. **12-MONTH ROADMAP** - Quarterly actions across protection, secrets, licensing, enforcement, ops
6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Baseline vs 6- and 12-month targets

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc filings, limited controls, reactive disputes)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic docketing, inconsistent secrets and licensing discipline)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable processes, clear roles, measurable portfolio management)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (disciplined strategy execution, proactive monitoring, strong controls)
- 5.0: Optimized (continuous improvement, portfolio ROI focus, high operational reliability)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Organization owning IP | "NorthBridge Robotics" |
| `[INDUSTRY]` | Industry context | "Industrial automation" |
| `[JURISDICTIONS]` | Primary jurisdictions | "US + EU + JP" |
| `[IP_PORTFOLIO]` | High-level portfolio | "85 patents, 30 trademarks, key trade secrets" |
| `[IP_BUDGET]` | Annual IP budget | "$2.5M" |

## Example

**Industrial Tech - Mixed Portfolio**

> Assess IP management readiness for **NorthBridge Robotics** in **industrial automation** operating across **US + EU + JP** with **85 patents, 30 trademarks, key trade secrets** and **$2.5M** annual budget. Strategy exists but filing priorities aren’t tied to product roadmap; docketing is reliable but prosecution quality varies by counsel; trade secrets aren’t classified and access controls are inconsistent; licensing decisions happen opportunistically without a standard evaluation model; monitoring is limited and dispute escalation is unclear; KPIs are not tracked consistently. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a 12-month roadmap.
