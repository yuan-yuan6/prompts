# Enterprise Digital Transformation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to run an enterprise digital transformation program spanning multiple business units, including governance, value tracking, culture change, and delivery execution.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess enterprise digital transformation readiness for [ORGANIZATION] spanning [BUSINESS_UNIT_COUNT] units with investment [TOTAL_INVESTMENT] over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Enterprise alignment & vision, (2) Portfolio management & value tracking, (3) Operating model & PMO, (4) Technology/data/security foundations, (5) Process redesign & customer experience, (6) Change, talent & culture. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day program setup plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Enterprise Alignment & Vision
- 1 — Initial: Units pursue separate agendas; outcomes are inconsistent; priorities conflict.
- 3 — Defined: Shared enterprise outcomes; agreed prioritization; clear scope boundaries.
- 5 — Optimized: Alignment is durable; decisions are consistent across units; tradeoffs are made quickly.

### 2) Portfolio Management & Value Tracking
- 1 — Initial: Initiative list without value logic; benefits are not tracked; duplicative efforts exist.
- 3 — Defined: Portfolio view with value cases; benefits realization tracked; prioritization rubric exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Portfolio actively managed; funding follows evidence; value realization is transparent and audited.

### 3) Operating Model & PMO
- 1 — Initial: Roles and responsibilities are unclear; delivery depends on heroics; coordination is weak.
- 3 — Defined: Program operating model; PMO standards; dependency and risk management routines.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales across units; predictable delivery; continuous improvement in governance and execution.

### 4) Technology/Data/Security Foundations
- 1 — Initial: Architecture decisions are local; integration and security are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Target architecture, integration patterns, and security-by-design standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Shared platforms and data products; strong governance enabling speed; reliability and security measured.

### 5) Process Redesign & Customer Experience
- 1 — Initial: Technology-first initiatives; limited process redesign; CX outcomes not measured.
- 3 — Defined: Priority journeys/processes mapped; redesign drives requirements; CX and operational KPIs tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: End-to-end ownership; measurable CX improvements; continuous optimization and adoption loops.

### 6) Change, Talent & Culture
- 1 — Initial: Change is under-resourced; skills gaps unmanaged; adoption is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Change plan and training; role clarity; adoption metrics and champions.
- 5 — Optimized: Transformation capability is institutionalized; incentives reinforce new behaviors; culture supports learning.

## Deliverables
- Enterprise readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Program operating model (roles, decision rights, cadence)
- Portfolio and benefits realization framework
- Dependency/risk management standards
- 90-day setup plan for governance, delivery, and change

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [BUSINESS_UNIT_COUNT]: Number of business units
- [TOTAL_INVESTMENT]: Program investment envelope
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 24 months)
- [TOP_INITIATIVES]: Portfolio candidate initiatives
- [VALUE_METRICS]: Value metrics (revenue, cost, risk reduction, CX)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Government agency modernizing citizen services across departments
- Scores (1–5): Alignment 2; Portfolio 2; Operating Model 2; Foundations 3; Process/CX 2; Change/Culture 2
- Top gaps: No benefits tracking, unclear decision rights, inconsistent adoption planning
- 90-day priorities: Stand up governance + PMO; define portfolio rubric and benefits tracking; map priority journeys; launch change champions and training
