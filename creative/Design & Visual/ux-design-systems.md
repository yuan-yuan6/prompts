3. **Document everything** - Clear documentation drives adoption and consistency
4. **Design for flexibility** - Components should adapt to various contexts
5. **Test extensively** - Validate components across browsers, devices, and use cases
6. **Involve stakeholders** - Gather input from designers, developers, and users
7. **Automate testing** - Use visual regression and accessibility testing tools
8. **Version control** - Track changes and maintain backward compatibility
9. **Encourage contribution** - Build a collaborative culture around the system
10. **Measure success** - Track adoption, usage, and impact metrics

## Tips for Success

- Use atomic design methodology for systematic component organization
- Create a living style guide that evolves with your products
- Integrate design tokens with development workflow for consistency
- Provide code examples alongside design documentation
- Build a community of practice around the design system
- Regular office hours for support and questions
