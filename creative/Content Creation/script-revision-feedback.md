3. **Test assumptions** - Use data to validate creative decisions
4. **Kill your darlings** - Remove elements that don't serve the story
5. **Read aloud** - Test dialogue and pacing by performing it
6. **Get fresh eyes** - Have someone unfamiliar review the script
7. **Track changes** - Maintain version history and revision notes
8. **Balance art and data** - Use metrics to inform, not dictate creativity
9. **Stay audience-focused** - Always consider viewer experience
10. **Know when to stop** - Avoid endless revision cycles

## Tips for Success
