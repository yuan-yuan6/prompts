# Creative Hobbies Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build a sustainable creative hobby practice across six dimensions: medium fit, practice system, resources, learning feedback loops, project execution, and long-term motivation.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **creative hobby readiness** for **{PROFILE}** pursuing **{CREATIVE_GOALS}** within **{CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension **1–5**, justify the score, and provide a 90-day plan with weekly practice blocks, starter projects, a feedback loop, and success metrics.

**Usage:** Replace the variables and run as a single prompt.

---

## Template

Conduct a creative hobbies readiness assessment for {PROFILE} pursuing {CREATIVE_GOALS} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) MEDIUM FIT & GOAL CLARITY**
- Clear medium choice (or a short exploration plan if undecided)
- Goals are specific and realistic (skill, expression, stress relief, gifts, portfolio)
- Constraints acknowledged (time, energy, space, budget)

**2) PRACTICE SYSTEM & ROUTINE**
- Scheduled practice blocks that fit life (frequency × duration)
- Low-friction setup (materials ready, default warm-up, no heavy prep)
- Consistency plan for busy weeks (minimum viable practice)

**3) RESOURCES & ENVIRONMENT**
- Appropriate beginner tools/supplies for the medium
- Workspace readiness (space, storage, lighting, noise considerations)
- Community/resources access (classes, online tutorials, local groups)

**4) LEARNING LOOP & FEEDBACK**
- Clear skill progression (fundamentals → small studies → projects)
- Feedback mechanism (self-review rubric, peer critique, instructor)
- Iteration habits (what to repeat, what to change, how to track)

**5) PROJECT SELECTION & COMPLETION**
- Picks projects sized to ability and available time
- Breaks projects into milestones (start → mid → finish)
- Finishing strategy (definition of done, sharing, archiving)

**6) MOTIVATION & SUSTAINABILITY**
- Intrinsic pull (enjoyment) vs purely outcome-driven
- Friction and perfectionism management
- Recovery and pacing to avoid burnout

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 90 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary constraint

3) **STARTER PROJECT PORTFOLIO**
- 6–10 starter projects sized for the constraints
- For each: timebox, materials, key skill, “definition of done”

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Weeks 1–4: foundations + exploration (if needed)
- Weeks 5–8: deliberate practice + 2 small projects
- Weeks 9–12: 1 larger project + sharing/review

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30/60/90-day targets for: practice sessions completed, hours practiced, projects finished, feedback cycles, enjoyment score

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal consistency)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some practice, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable routine, occasional stalls)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (consistent output, improving quality)
- 5.0: Optimized (sustainable, self-directed mastery loop)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {PROFILE} | Skill level + medium interest + context | “Beginner, wants to try watercolor, busy parent” |
| {CREATIVE_GOALS} | What you want from the hobby | “Stress relief + make 3 gifts in 90 days” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “2×45min/week, $80 budget, small desk, low mess” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {PROFILE}: Beginner, wants a relaxing visual hobby, curious about watercolor; works full-time
- {CREATIVE_GOALS}: Stress relief and skill basics; finish 3 small pieces suitable as gifts
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 2×45 minutes/week; budget $75; small apartment desk; prefers low mess

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.4/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities (90 days): (1) lock a simple 2-day routine, (2) use a tiny starter kit, (3) finish small postcard projects

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary constraint |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Medium Fit & Goal Clarity | 4.0 | Clear medium + realistic gift goal | Perfectionism risk |
| Practice System & Routine | 3.0 | Two stable slots available | Busy weeks derail routine |
| Resources & Environment | 3.5 | Desk space works; low-mess preference | Storage limited |
| Learning Loop & Feedback | 3.0 | Willing to follow tutorials | No feedback habit |
| Project Selection & Completion | 3.0 | Gift-sized output is right-sized | Over-scoping pieces |
| Motivation & Sustainability | 4.0 | Relaxation-focused goal | Friction if setup is annoying |

3) **STARTER PROJECT PORTFOLIO**
- 10-minute warm-ups (x8): simple washes + gradients; done = 8 swatches saved
- Postcard #1 (45 min): “Sunset wash”; materials: 3 colors; done = signed + dated
- Postcard #2 (45 min): “Leaf study”; skill: wet-on-dry edges; done = 1 finished leaf
- Postcard #3 (45 min): “Simple landscape”; skill: value separation; done = framed crop
- Mini-series (2 sessions): “3 teacups” study; skill: light/shadow; done = 3 small cups
- Gift set (3 sessions): “3 postcards matching palette”; done = packaged with envelopes

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Routine breaks on busy weeks → no minimum plan → set a 10-minute fallback session
- Gap 2: Setup feels like work → supplies scattered → keep a single “go kit” box
- Gap 3: Skill plateau → no feedback loop → use a 5-point self-review after each piece
- Gap 4: Projects too ambitious → unclear sizing → always timebox to 45 minutes per session
- Gap 5: Motivation dips → no sharing → share one piece every two weeks with a safe audience

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Weeks 1–4: 2 sessions/week; 10-min warm-up + 35-min fundamentals; finish 1 postcard/week
- Weeks 5–8: keep routine; add one focused drill (edges/values); finish 2-piece mini-series
- Weeks 9–12: choose one larger piece (2–3 sessions); finalize 3-gift set; do a short retrospective

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Practice sessions completed: 0 → 24
- Hours practiced: 0 → 18
- Projects finished: 0 → 6
- Feedback cycles completed: 0 → 12
- Enjoyment (self-rated): 5/10 → 7/10

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Timebox everything early** — constraints protect momentum.
2) **Use a minimum viable practice** — a 10-minute fallback prevents resets.
3) **Start with a small, complete kit** — upgrade only after 30 days of consistency.
4) **Alternate drills and projects** — fundamentals improve faster when applied.
5) **Define “done” before starting** — completion beats endless tinkering.
6) **Track inputs and outputs** — sessions + finished pieces are the core signals.
7) **Create a feedback loop** — self-review or a trusted peer accelerates learning.
8) **Make sharing low-stakes** — gentle accountability sustains motivation.
