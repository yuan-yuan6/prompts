# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment - Part 2: Risk Provisions

## Purpose
Assess readiness to draft and negotiate risk provisions that allocate downside exposure clearly and enforceably across six dimensions: Liability Allocation, Indemnities, Warranties & Remedies, Termination & Transition, Dispute Resolution, and Insurance/Compliance. Identify gaps, prioritize decisions, and produce a negotiation-ready positions matrix.

## Template

Conduct a contract risk-provisions readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION} negotiating a {CONTRACT_TYPE} aligned to {RISK_APPETITE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. LIABILITY ALLOCATION READINESS**
- Liability structure defined (direct/indirect; categories of loss; time limits)
- Caps are set and justified (multiple, aggregate, super-cap areas)
- Exclusions are coherent (consequential, lost profits, data loss) and not self-contradictory
- Carve-outs aligned to risk (fraud, willful misconduct, confidentiality, IP, privacy/security)
- Risk-to-economics alignment (fees, insurance, control, ability to prevent)
- Internal approvals and negotiation guardrails exist

**2. INDEMNITIES & THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS READINESS**
- Indemnity scope defined (what triggers; whose acts; which claims)
- Defense and control mechanics specified (selection of counsel, consent to settle)
- Cooperation and notice requirements are workable (avoid forfeiture traps)
- IP infringement posture defined (scope, exclusions, mitigation options)
- Privacy/security and regulatory claim handling is addressed where relevant
- Indemnity vs insurance interplay is understood

**3. WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS & REMEDIES READINESS**
- Warranties are specific and achievable (performance, compliance, authority)
- Disclaimers are appropriate (merchantability/fitness) and consistent with obligations
- Cure periods and remedy pathways are defined (re-perform, replace, credits)
- SLA/credit structure (if applicable) aligns with liability and termination rights
- Material breach definition is not vague or easily abused
- “Sole and exclusive remedy” decisions are intentional and realistic

**4. TERMINATION, SUSPENSION & TRANSITION READINESS**
- Termination rights are balanced (for cause, convenience, insolvency, regulatory)
- Cure and suspension rules are defined (especially for non-payment/security issues)
- Fees on termination are addressed (true-up, wind-down, early termination)
- Return/destruction of data and materials is specified (timing, formats, verification)
- Transition assistance and handover obligations are defined where needed
- Survival clause is correct (confidentiality, IP, payment, disputes, audit rights)

**5. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & GOVERNING LAW READINESS**
- Governing law and venue selected intentionally (predictability, enforceability)
- Escalation/ADR path defined (exec escalation, mediation, arbitration/litigation)
- Interim relief and injunction needs covered (IP/confidentiality/security)
- Attorneys’ fees and cost shifting decisions made intentionally
- Notice and limitation-of-action provisions are fair and enforceable
- Evidence preservation and audit rights interplay considered

**6. INSURANCE, COMPLIANCE & SPECIAL RISKS READINESS**
- Insurance requirements are realistic (types, limits, additional insured, certificates)
- Compliance obligations are specific (standards, audit rights, reporting, cooperation)
- Subcontractor flow-downs defined (and monitored) where risk requires
- Data protection/security commitments are aligned to actual controls
- Sector-specific obligations addressed (export controls, AML, healthcare, accessibility)
- Risk register for “non-standard” clauses exists (and owners are assigned)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 risk decisions to make

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **POSITIONS MATRIX** - Preferred position, fallback, and walk-away for key clauses

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended fixes

5. **NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOK** - Redline rationale, acceptable alternatives, approval thresholds

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Fewer escalations, fewer late-stage surprises, faster close cycle

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (inconsistent positions, reactive negotiation)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic clauses, frequent escalation)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable positions, clear approvals)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (risk-aligned positions matrix, efficient playbook use)
- 5.0: Optimized (fast, consistent negotiation with measured risk outcomes)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Contracting organization | "NorthBridge Payments" |
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "Professional services agreement" |
| `[RISK_APPETITE]` | Risk posture and constraints | "Balanced (reasonable cap; strong privacy/security)" |

## Example

**FinTech - Professional Services**

> Assess contract risk-provisions readiness for **NorthBridge Payments** negotiating a **professional services agreement** under **Balanced (reasonable cap; strong privacy/security)**. (1) Liability—cap is proposed as fees paid, but carve-outs are broad and undefined. (2) Indemnities—IP and privacy are requested; defense/settlement control is unclear. (3) Warranties—vendor promises “industry best” security without measurable standard; remedies are vague. (4) Termination—customer wants convenience termination without wind-down fees; transition assistance is undefined. (5) Disputes—arbitration is proposed but injunctive relief for confidentiality/IP is not preserved. (6) Insurance—cyber coverage is requested but certificate/evidence process is unclear. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a positions matrix with preferred/fallback/walk-away.
