## Best Practices

1. **Start low-fidelity** - Begin with sketches and simple wireframes
2. **Focus on content first** - Establish hierarchy and structure before visuals
3. **Design mobile-first** - Start with constraints, expand to larger screens
4. **Test early and often** - Validate assumptions with users continuously
5. **Annotate thoroughly** - Document interactions, states, and behaviors
6. **Use real content** - Avoid lorem ipsum, use realistic content
7. **Design for all states** - Include loading, error, empty, and success states
8. **Consider accessibility** - Build in accessibility from the wireframe stage
9. **Keep stakeholders involved** - Regular reviews prevent late-stage surprises
10. **Prototype at the right fidelity** - Match fidelity to what you need to test

## Tips for Success

- Create a component library in your wireframing tool for consistency
- Use flowchart tools to map user journeys before wireframing
- Test information architecture with card sorting early
- Build a repository of interaction patterns for reuse
- Include developers in wireframe reviews for technical feedback
- Document design decisions to build institutional knowledge
- Use collaborative design tools for real-time team input
- Create templates for common page types and flows
- Balance visual polish with speed of iteration
- Focus prototyping effort on high-risk or novel interactions

## Customization Options

### 1. Fidelity Level
Adapt approach for different fidelity needs (sketches, low-fi, hi-fi, coded) based on project stage and validation goals.

### 2. Platform Focus
Customize for specific platforms (mobile app, web app, desktop) with platform-appropriate patterns and constraints.

### 3. Feature Complexity
Scale wireframing detail based on feature complexity (simple forms vs. complex workflows) with appropriate documentation.

### 4. Team Size
Adjust collaboration approach for team size (solo designer, small team, large organization) with appropriate review processes.

### 5. Timeline Constraints
Balance speed and thoroughness based on timeline (rapid prototyping vs. detailed specification) while maintaining quality.
