# Screening & Interview Process

## Purpose
Design structured, consistent screening and interview processes that objectively evaluate candidates while providing an excellent candidate experience.

## Quick Start

Process: Phone screen (30 min) → Hiring manager interview (60 min) → Team panel (90 min) → Final with VP. Evaluate: strategic thinking, campaign execution, collaboration skills, cultural fit. Decision within 5 business days.
```

### When to Use This
- Hiring for critical or high-volume positions
- Standardizing interview process across teams
- Training new interviewers

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Design process** - Define stages, create questions, build scorecards
2. **Train interviewers** - Share evaluation criteria, practice behavioral questions
3. **Execute and refine** - Conduct interviews, gather feedback, improve process

**Time to complete**: 1 week to design process, 2-4 weeks per candidate cycle
