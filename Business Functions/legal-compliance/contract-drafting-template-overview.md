# Contract Drafting Readiness Assessment - Overview & Navigation

## Purpose
Use this overview to pick the right contract drafting readiness assessment and run the parts in the right order:

- **Part 1: Structure & Core Clauses** - Parties, authority, definitions, scope, commercial terms, basic boilerplate.
- **Part 2: Risk Provisions** - Liability caps, indemnities, warranties, IP, confidentiality, termination, compliance.
- **Part 3: Execution & Management** - Signatures, exhibits, amendments, notices, contract lifecycle, recordkeeping.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> For **[CONTRACT_TYPE]** between **[PARTY_A]** and **[PARTY_B]** under **[GOVERNING_LAW]**, choose the best starting part: (1) If scope, parties, commercial terms, or definitions are unclear, start with **Part 1**. (2) If the business terms are agreed but risk allocation is contentious or high-stakes, start with **Part 2**. (3) If terms are negotiated but execution, schedules, and lifecycle handling are unclear, start with **Part 3**. Provide: the starting part, the sequence for remaining parts, and the minimum inputs required (term sheet, scope, data/security requirements, risk tolerance, required clauses).

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics.

## Template

Use this decision guide for {CONTRACT_TYPE}:

**A. Choose the starting point**

- Start with **Part 1** if any of these are true:
  - Parties/legal entities or authority to sign are unclear
  - Scope/deliverables and acceptance criteria are not defined
  - Price/payment and core commercial terms are not agreed
  - Definitions and term structure are inconsistent across drafts

- Start with **Part 2** if any of these are true:
  - Liability/indemnity positions are the main blocker
  - IP ownership/licensing is unclear or high-value
  - Confidentiality/privacy/security obligations drive the deal
  - Termination rights and remedies are not aligned

- Start with **Part 3** if any of these are true:
  - Signature process, exhibits, or required approvals are unclear
  - Change control/amendments and notices are missing
  - Renewals, audits, and recordkeeping expectations are unclear

**B. Define constraints**
- Governing law: {GOVERNING_LAW}
- Risk tolerance: {RISK_TOLERANCE}
- Required clause positions: {REQUIRED_POSITIONS}

**C. Run the assessments**
- Run the selected part first and capture the scorecard, top gaps, and drafting checklist.
- Run the remaining parts in sequence to produce a complete “ready-to-draft” package.

Deliver your navigation output as:

1. **STARTING PART** - Which part and why
2. **SEQUENCE** - Recommended order for remaining parts
3. **MINIMUM INPUTS** - Documents/data needed to draft efficiently
4. **STAKEHOLDERS** - Legal, procurement, security, finance, business owner
5. **OUTPUT PACKAGE** - Scorecards + consolidated drafting checklist

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (unclear scope/positions; drafting will churn)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (some inputs exist; negotiation friction likely)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (inputs and positions are mostly clear)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (repeatable playbooks and fast approvals)
- 5.0: Optimized (standardized positions, low cycle time)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[CONTRACT_TYPE]` | Agreement type | "SaaS MSA" |
| `[PARTY_A]` | One party | "Customer" |
| `[PARTY_B]` | Other party | "Vendor" |
| `[GOVERNING_LAW]` | Governing law | "New York" |
| `[RISK_TOLERANCE]` | Risk posture | "Medium" |
| `[REQUIRED_POSITIONS]` | Must-have positions | "No uncapped indemnity" |

## Example

**Picking where to start**

> For **SaaS MSA** between **Customer** and **Vendor** under **New York** law, start with **Part 2** because liability caps, IP, and indemnities are the main blocker. Then run **Part 3** to finalize exhibits, signature workflow, and amendment process, and finish with **Part 1** to tighten definitions and acceptance criteria.
