# AI Strategy Roadmap

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive AI strategy that articulates the vision, strategic pillars, investment priorities, and multi-year roadmap for AI adoption across the organization—translating AI potential into business value.

## 🚀 Quick Strategy Prompt

> Develop an **AI strategy roadmap** for **[ORGANIZATION]** in **[INDUSTRY]** with **[REVENUE/SIZE]** and **[CURRENT AI MATURITY: nascent/developing/advanced]**. Analyze: (1) **Vision & objectives**—what's the 3-5 year AI vision aligned with business strategy? What are the primary value drivers (efficiency, growth, innovation, risk)? (2) **Strategic pillars**—what are 3-5 focus areas (customer experience, operations, products, decision-making)? How do these map to competitive advantage? (3) **Capability requirements**—what investments in data infrastructure, talent, platforms, and governance are needed? (4) **Roadmap & investment**—what's the phased approach across horizons (foundation, scale, transform)? What's the budget envelope and expected ROI? Provide an executive-ready strategy document with vision statement, pillar definitions, capability roadmap, and investment framework.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for strategic AI planning guidance.

STRATEGIC PILLARS:
1. Predictive Services - Equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, 
   performance optimization for customers → New $200M service revenue stream
   
2. Smart Manufacturing - Quality prediction, yield optimization, 
   autonomous assembly → 25% cost reduction
   
3. Intelligent Supply Chain - Demand sensing, inventory optimization,
   supplier risk management → $50M working capital reduction

- Year 1: $6M (Foundation + pilots)
- Year 2: $9M (Scale + products)
- Year 3: $10M (Transform + innovation)

EXPECTED ROI: 180% over 3 years ($45M annual value by Year 3)

GOVERNANCE: AI Ethics Board + Model Risk Management integration
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Anchor to Business Strategy** - AI strategy must directly support business objectives. Start with "what does the business need?" not "what can AI do?"

2. **Be Realistic About Timeline** - AI transformation takes 3-5 years. Plan for the long term while delivering quick wins in months 3-12.

3. **Invest in Foundations** - 40-50% of Year 1 budget should go to data, platform, and governance—not just use cases.

4. **Balance Portfolio** - Mix quick wins (6 months) with strategic bets (2+ years). Don't over-index on either.

5. **Plan for Talent** - AI talent is the #1 constraint. Start recruiting and upskilling immediately.

6. **Establish Governance Early** - AI ethics and risk frameworks are easier to build than retrofit.

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Technology-First Strategy** - Focusing on AI capabilities without clear business value
✅ Instead: Start with business problems and work backward to AI solutions

❌ **Underestimating Change** - Treating AI as a technology project, not a transformation
✅ Instead: Include change management, training, and culture in the roadmap

❌ **Pilot Purgatory** - Successful pilots that never scale to production
✅ Instead: Plan for scaling from day one; include production criteria in pilot design

❌ **Ignoring Data Debt** - Assuming data is ready for AI
✅ Instead: Conduct data assessment early; include data remediation in roadmap

❌ **Going It Alone** - Trying to build everything internally
✅ Instead: Strategic use of partners and vendors to accelerate and fill gaps
