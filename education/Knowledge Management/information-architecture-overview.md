# Information Architecture - Overview

## Purpose
Create comprehensive information architecture systems covering strategy, taxonomy, navigation, search, and continuous optimization to improve content findability and user experience.

## Framework Components

This framework has been split into focused modules:

### 1. Strategy & Planning
**File:** `ia-strategy.md`
- Research and discovery
- User research and analysis
- Content strategy alignment
- Business requirements

### 2. Taxonomy & Classification
**File:** `ia-taxonomy-classification.md`
- Taxonomy development
- Metadata schema design
- Content type models
- Tagging systems
- Semantic relationships

### 3. Navigation & Wayfinding
**File:** `ia-navigation-design.md`
- Navigation system design
- Information hierarchy
- Labeling and nomenclature
- Wayfinding elements
- Filtering systems

### 4. Search & Findability
**File:** `ia-search-findability.md`
- Search functionality design
- Results optimization
- Relevance tuning
- Search analytics
- Content discovery

### 5. Testing & Optimization
**File:** `ia-testing-optimization.md`
- Usability testing methods
- IA validation techniques
- Analytics and measurement
- Governance and maintenance
- Continuous improvement

## Quick Start Template

```

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Research & Strategy (Weeks 1-6)**
- User research and personas
- Content inventory and audit
- Stakeholder alignment
- Strategy development

**Phase 2: Design & Structure (Weeks 7-12)**
- Taxonomy development
- Navigation design
- Metadata schema
- Content modeling

**Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 13-18)**
- Usability testing
- IA validation
- Refinement and iteration
- Documentation

**Phase 4: Implementation & Optimization (Weeks 19-24)**
- IA implementation
- Analytics setup
- Governance establishment
- Continuous optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Start with users** - Base IA on user research
2. **Test early and often** - Validate throughout
3. **Keep it simple** - Avoid over-complexity
4. **Maintain consistency** - Use consistent patterns
5. **Measure and optimize** - Track and improve continuously
