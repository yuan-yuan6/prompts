# Treasury Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to manage treasury in a way that provides reliable cash visibility, adequate liquidity buffers, controlled financial risk (FX/IR), and consistent governance.

## Quick Prompt
Assess treasury readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] operating in [GLOBAL_OPERATIONS] with [REVENUE_SIZE] revenue. Evaluate cash visibility and forecasting, liquidity and funding plan, banking operations and controls, FX/interest rate risk management, investment policy for excess cash, and governance/reporting cadence. Score each 1–5 and list the top 3 gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Cash Visibility & Forecasting
- 1: Cash positions are unclear; forecasts are sporadic.
- 3: Weekly/monthly forecast exists for key entities.
- 5: Multi-horizon forecasting with reconciled drivers and clear ownership.

2) Liquidity Planning & Funding Readiness
- 1: Liquidity buffer is undefined; funding is reactive.
- 3: Buffer targets exist; debt schedule tracked.
- 5: Liquidity policy, contingency plan, and funding playbook are standard.

3) Banking Operations, Payments & Controls
- 1: Processes are manual; controls are inconsistent.
- 3: Core controls exist; periodic reviews.
- 5: Segregation of duties, approval workflows, and auditability are standard.

4) FX and Interest Rate Risk Management
- 1: Exposures are not measured consistently.
- 3: Key exposures tracked; hedging used selectively.
- 5: Policy-driven hedging, effectiveness checks, and thresholds are standard.

5) Investment Policy for Excess Cash
- 1: Investments are opportunistic; risk limits unclear.
- 3: Basic policy exists (instruments, duration, ratings).
- 5: Policy is enforced with limits, monitoring, and counterparty governance.

6) Governance, Reporting & Decision Support
- 1: Reporting is ad hoc; stakeholders are surprised.
- 3: Monthly reporting for key metrics.
- 5: Standard reporting pack, escalation paths, and clear decision rights.

## Deliverables
- Cash visibility map (accounts, entities, timing) and forecasting model overview
- Liquidity policy (buffers, triggers, contingency actions)
- Banking and payments control checklist (approvals, access, SoD)
- FX/IR risk policy (exposure measurement, hedging rules, limits)
- Investment policy (permitted instruments, duration/credit limits, monitoring)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — manual, inconsistent, and opaque.
- Level 2: Documented — policies exist but enforcement varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — core forecasting and controls are standard.
- Level 4: Managed — policy-driven risk management and governance are consistent.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement with measured outcomes.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [GLOBAL_OPERATIONS]
- [REVENUE_SIZE]
- [CURRENT_CASH_BALANCE]
- [DEBT_PORTFOLIO]
- [CURRENCY_EXPOSURES]
- [LIQUIDITY_TARGETS]

## Example (Condensed)
Global manufacturer with multi-currency cash and seasonal working capital swings.
- Forecast: 13-week cash forecast by entity with reconciliation to actuals.
- Liquidity: buffer targets and revolver headroom triggers.
- Risk: FX policy for transactional exposure; rate policy for floating debt.
- Output: monthly treasury pack with KRIs and action triggers.
