# Recruitment Metrics & Optimization Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to measure and optimize recruiting performance using consistent definitions, dashboards, and an improvement loop tied to hiring outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess recruiting analytics readiness for [ORGANIZATION] hiring [HEADCOUNT] roles/quarter. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) KPI definitions, (2) Data quality & instrumentation, (3) Funnel analytics, (4) Reporting & cadence, (5) Experimentation & optimization, (6) Governance & decisioning. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) KPI Definitions
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are inconsistent; teams don’t agree on definitions.
- 3 — Defined: Standard KPI dictionary (time-to-fill, pass-through, QoH) defined.
- 5 — Optimized: KPIs are stable, comparable, and tied to outcomes.

### 2) Data Quality & Instrumentation
- 1 — Initial: ATS data incomplete; stages/fields inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Required fields and data QA; stage definitions standardized.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted; issues are detected quickly; automation reduces gaps.

### 3) Funnel Analytics
- 1 — Initial: No view of bottlenecks; only top-line metrics.
- 3 — Defined: Stage conversion rates tracked; bottlenecks identified.
- 5 — Optimized: Segmented analytics drive targeted fixes and predictable improvements.

### 4) Reporting & Cadence
- 1 — Initial: Reporting ad-hoc; insights aren’t acted on.
- 3 — Defined: Dashboards and weekly/monthly review cadences.
- 5 — Optimized: Cadence is decision-grade; actions and owners are tracked to closure.

### 5) Experimentation & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: No experimentation; changes are uncontrolled.
- 3 — Defined: Test backlog and simple experiments (messaging, steps).
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization is continuous; learnings compound across roles and teams.

### 6) Governance & Decisioning
- 1 — Initial: No ownership; metrics don’t drive decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Owners and decision rights; thresholds and triggers defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance turns metrics into reliable decisions and outcomes.

## Deliverables
- Recruiting analytics readiness scorecard and gap list
- KPI dictionary and data definitions
- Funnel dashboard spec (by role/segment)
- Review cadence and action-tracking workflow
- Optimization backlog and experimentation plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [HEADCOUNT]: Hiring volume
- [ATS]: ATS platform
- [KPI_SET]: KPI list
- [STAGE_DEFS]: Funnel stage definitions
- [QUALITY_OF_HIRE]: Metric definition

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Recruiting team tracking only time-to-fill
- Scores (1–5): Definitions 2; Data 2; Funnel 2; Cadence 3; Experiments 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize KPI dictionary; fix ATS stages; implement funnel dashboards and monthly optimization cadence
