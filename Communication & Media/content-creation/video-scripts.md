# Video Scripts Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive video script strategies for YouTube, documentaries, ads, explainers, tutorials, vlogs, and other video content to engage audiences, communicate messages effectively, and achieve content objectives.

## Quick Video Scripts Prompt

Write a [duration] video script for [video type: YouTube/ad/explainer/tutorial] about [topic]. Create attention-grabbing hook in first [seconds], structure with [sections/chapters], include [presenter direction/B-roll notes], write dialogue for [tone: educational/entertaining/persuasive], add call-to-action for [viewer goal], and optimize for [platform algorithm/retention]. Target [audience] with [key message] and [desired action].

## Quick Start

Ready to bring your vision to screen? Here's your fast-track to compelling video scripts:

**30-Second Quickstart:**
1. Define your video type (YouTube tutorial, documentary, ad, explainer)
2. Identify your target platform and audience
3. Fill in the essential variables: PROJECT_TITLE, VIDEO_TYPE, TARGET_DURATION, MAIN_OBJECTIVE
4. Generate your comprehensive script with platform-specific optimizations

**First-Time User Path:**
- Start with a simple explainer video or tutorial (easier structure)
- Focus on sections 2.2 (Opening/Hook) and 2.3 (Content Structure) first
- Use Example 1 (YouTube Educational Channel) as your template
- Generate initial script, then refine based on feedback

**Pro Tip:** The first 15 seconds make or break your video. Jump straight to section 2.2 "Opening and Hook Development" to craft an attention-grabbing opener that maximizes viewer retention from frame one.

**Common Use Cases:**
- YouTube content creators needing algorithm-friendly scripts

**Script**:

```
[0:00-0:15] HOOK
[Visual: Split screen showing stressed stock trader vs. relaxed investor]

"One investor spent 40 hours a week picking stocks...and lost money. The other spent 10 minutes a month...and beat 90% of professionals. Here's how."

[Quick cut montage of charts, money growing]

---

[0:15-1:00] INTRO & CREDIBILITY

"Hey, it's Sarah. If you're new here, I teach personal finance without the BS. Today, we're breaking down index fund investing—the strategy Warren Buffett recommends for 99% of people.

By the end of this video, you'll know:
✓ What index funds are (and why they beat active investing)
✓ Exactly which funds to buy
✓ How to set up auto-investing in 10 minutes

Stick around to the end—I'll show you my actual portfolio and returns.

[1:00-3:30] EDUCATION (Problem + Solution)

**[1:00-1:45] The Problem with Stock Picking**

"Here's what most beginners do wrong: They buy individual stocks—Tesla, Apple, whatever's trending.

[Visual: Stock price rollercoaster, red arrows]

Problem?
- 90% of active investors underperform the market.
- You're competing against Harvard MBAs with supercomputers.
- It's stressful. One bad quarter, your portfolio tanks.

There's a better way."

**[1:45-3:30] The Solution: Index Funds**

"Enter index funds. Instead of picking individual stocks, you buy the ENTIRE market.

[Visual: Map of USA with company logos]

Example: The S&P 500 Index Fund
- Owns pieces of 500 biggest US companies
- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon...all in one fund
- Costs $3 per year for every $10,000 invested (0.03% fee)

[Animated chart showing S&P 500 growth over 30 years]

Historical returns? 10% per year average (since 1926).

$10,000 invested → $174,494 in 30 years (no additional contributions).

[Show calculation on screen]

Warren Buffett's advice? 'Put 10% of cash in short-term bonds, 90% in low-cost S&P 500 index fund.'

That's it. Boring? Yes. Effective? Hell yes."

[3:30-6:00] HOW-TO (Step-by-step)

"Okay, let's set this up. Takes 10 minutes.

**Step 1: Open a Brokerage Account** [3:30-4:15]
[Screen recording of Vanguard/Fidelity website]

'I use Vanguard, but Fidelity and Schwab are great too. All have:
- $0 minimum to start
- No trading fees
- Easy mobile app'

[Quick demo of signup process]

**Step 2: Choose Your Index Fund** [4:15-5:00]

'Here are the big three:

1. **Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI)** - My pick
   - Expense ratio: 0.03%
   - Owns entire US market (3,900+ companies)

2. **Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO)**
   - Expense ratio: 0.03%
   - Top 500 companies only

3. **Fidelity ZERO Total Market (FZROX)**
   - Expense ratio: 0.00% (yes, free!)
   - Fidelity customers only'

[Side-by-side comparison chart]

Can't go wrong with any of these. I own VTI.

**Step 3: Automate Your Investing** [5:00-6:00]

[Screen recording: Setting up automatic investment]

'This is the secret sauce.

Set up automatic monthly investment:
- $100/month? Great.
- $500/month? Even better.
- Whatever you can afford.

[Show calendar with recurring investment marked]

The magic? You're not trying to time the market. You're dollar-cost averaging.

Market up? You buy.
Market down? You buy MORE (shares are cheaper!).

Over time, this smooths out volatility.'

[6:00-7:15] PROOF (Show My Portfolio)

"Alright, proof time. Here's my actual Vanguard account."

Current balance: $94,357
Total invested: $52,000
Gains: $42,357 (81% return)

[Show performance graph]

Did I time the market? Nope.
Did I pick hot stocks? Nope.
Did I stress? Nope.

I set it, forgot it, and let compound interest do its thing."

---

[7:15-7:50] OBJECTIONS

"I know what you're thinking...

'But Sarah, what if the market crashes?'

It will. Historically, every 7-10 years.

2008 crash? Down 37%. Recovered in 4 years.
2020 COVID crash? Down 34%. Recovered in 5 MONTHS.

[Show recovery chart]

Long-term investors don't care about crashes. They BUY during crashes.

'Should I wait for a dip?'

No. Studies show time IN the market beats TIMING the market.

[Show missed gains chart if waiting for perfect entry]

Start today, even if it's $50."
