## Template

Design security architecture for {ORGANIZATION} supporting {BUSINESS_CONTEXT} achieving {SECURITY_OBJECTIVES} with {REGULATORY_REQUIREMENTS} compliance using {ARCHITECTURE_FRAMEWORK}.

**SECURITY ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES**

Foundation principles guide all design decisions. Zero trust: never trust, always verify (verify every access request regardless of network location, no implicit trust based on network position, continuous verification throughout session, assume breach posture—design for containment not just prevention), identity-centric security (identity is new perimeter, strong authentication required, authorization at every layer, least privilege by default). Defense in depth: layered security controls ensure no single point of failure (7 layers: perimeter security, network security, endpoint security, application security, data security, identity security, physical security), compensating controls where primary controls insufficient, fail-secure design (default to deny access, lock down on anomaly detection, security controls fail closed not open).

Least privilege: minimal access required for job function (start with zero access add minimum necessary, role-based access control aligned with business roles, just-in-time privilege elevation for administrative tasks, regular access reviews remove stale permissions quarterly), separation of duties (no single person can complete critical transaction, developer cannot deploy to production without approval, privileged operations require dual authorization). Security by design: security integrated from start not bolted on (threat modeling during architecture phase, security requirements in user stories, security gates in CI/CD pipeline, secure defaults—opt-in for risky features not opt-out).

Complete mediation: every access checked, no assumptions (authorization verified at every layer—API gateway, application logic, database, cache invalidation doesn't bypass checks, session management prevents replay attacks). Psychological acceptability: security doesn't impede legitimate users excessively (SSO reduces password fatigue, adaptive authentication—MFA when risk elevated not always, self-service password reset with strong verification, usable security increases compliance). Open design: security through proper implementation not obscurity (cryptographic algorithms public and peer-reviewed, security architecture documented and reviewed, assume attacker knows system design, security relies on secrets like keys not hidden algorithms).

**IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE**

Identity is foundation of zero trust. Identity strategy: centralized identity management (single source of truth for identities—Okta/Azure AD/Google Workspace, consistent identity across cloud and on-premises, automated provisioning and deprovisioning from HR system, identity lifecycle management from hire to termination), federated identity (SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO, OAuth 2.0/OIDC for API authorization and modern apps, WS-Federation for legacy applications, cross-domain federation for partners and M&A).

Authentication mechanisms: multi-factor authentication mandatory (100% coverage for workforce, phishing-resistant MFA for privileged users—FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware keys, risk-based adaptive authentication—step up to MFA when unusual activity, passwordless where possible—Windows Hello, Touch ID, biometric), strong password policies where passwords required (12+ character minimum, complexity requirements, pwned password checking via Have I Been Pwned API, password managers encouraged), certificate-based authentication (client certificates for high-security systems, mutual TLS for service-to-service, smart cards for government and high-security environments).

Authorization models: role-based access control (RBAC) for standard access (roles aligned with job functions—engineer, manager, analyst, role hierarchy with inheritance, role assignments audited quarterly), attribute-based access control (ABAC) for dynamic policies (policy combines user attributes—department, clearance, resource attributes—classification, sensitivity, contextual attributes—time of day, location, device posture, fine-grained access decisions), policy-based access control (PBAC) for sensitive data (separate policies per data classification, ownership and approval workflows, temporal access—grant for project duration then auto-revoke).

Privileged access management (PAM): credential vaulting (CyberArk, BeyondTrust, HashiCorp Vault for secrets, automatic password rotation 30-90 days, checkout workflow for shared credentials, emergency break-glass procedures with full audit), just-in-time (JIT) access (time-boxed privilege elevation—maximum 4 hour sessions, approval workflow via ServiceNow or PagerDuty, automatic revocation after time expires, business justification required), session monitoring (all privileged sessions recorded, keystroke logging, live monitoring for sensitive operations, searchable session recordings for forensics).

Identity governance and administration (IGA): access certification (quarterly reviews for privileged access, annual reviews for standard users, manager attestation with consequences for non-response, automated revocation for uncertified access), orphaned account cleanup (accounts for terminated employees removed within 24 hours, dormant accounts disabled after 90 days, service account inventory and ownership), segregation of duties enforcement (SOD conflict detection—developer cannot approve own code, compensating controls where conflicts unavoidable, periodic SOD audits).

**NETWORK SECURITY ARCHITECTURE**

Design defense-in-depth network controls. Network segmentation: macro-segmentation (separate VLANs/VPCs for production, development, corporate, guest networks, DMZ for internet-facing services isolated from internal, PCI CDE segregated with strict firewall rules, management network out-of-band), micro-segmentation (software-defined perimeter with VMware NSX or Cisco ACI, workload-level firewalling beyond VLAN isolation, east-west traffic inspection prevents lateral movement, application-aware policies not just port-based).

Perimeter security: next-generation firewalls (Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco Firepower with application identification not just port/protocol, threat prevention—IPS, anti-malware, URL filtering, SSL/TLS decryption and inspection with privacy considerations, high availability with automatic failover), web application firewall (WAF) for internet-facing applications (AWS WAF, Cloudflare, F5 with OWASP Core Rule Set, bot detection and mitigation, API protection, rate limiting and DDoS mitigation), DDoS protection (cloud-based scrubbing—Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield, on-premises appliances for instant response, hybrid approach—on-prem for volumetric, cloud for protocol/application).

Zero trust network access (ZTNA): replace VPN with identity-based access (Zscaler Private Access, Cloudflare Access, Palo Alto Prisma Access, no network-level access—only application-level, verify user identity and device posture before every connection, no lateral movement—users connect to apps not network, continuous verification throughout session). Software-defined perimeter (SDP): hide infrastructure from internet (servers not publicly routable, single packet authorization for access, deny-by-default posture, infrastructure invisible to reconnaissance).

Internal network security: network access control (NAC) with 802.1X (Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass, ForeScout for wired and wireless authentication, device profiling and automatic VLAN assignment, guest network isolation, quarantine VLAN for non-compliant devices), intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS at network boundaries, behavioral detection for anomalies, threat intelligence integration for IOC blocking, tuning to reduce false positives <20%), network monitoring (NetFlow/sFlow for traffic analysis, network detection and response—Darktrace, Vectra for behavioral analytics, east-west traffic visibility critical for lateral movement detection).

Remote access security: secure remote work (no traditional VPN—ZTNA instead, endpoint device management—MDM for mobile, configuration management for laptops, always-on encryption, conditional access policies based on device compliance), site-to-site connectivity (IPsec VPN for branch offices, SD-WAN for application-aware routing and built-in security, Direct Connect/ExpressRoute for cloud connectivity, encrypted overlays).

**APPLICATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE**

Secure applications throughout lifecycle. Secure development lifecycle (SDLC): security by design (threat modeling during design phase identifies threats early, security requirements alongside functional requirements, security user stories in backlog, abuse cases document what attackers might do), secure coding practices (OWASP guidelines for common vulnerabilities, framework-specific security features—parameterized queries, CSRF tokens, security training for developers annually, peer code review with security focus).

Application security testing: static analysis (SAST) in CI/CD (Checkmarx, SonarQube, Veracode scanning source code for vulnerabilities, fail build on critical findings, developer-friendly output with fix guidance, incremental scanning—only changed code for speed), dynamic analysis (DAST) on running applications (weekly automated scans with Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix, authenticated scans for deeper coverage, manual penetration testing annually or before major releases), software composition analysis (SCA) for dependencies (Snyk, WhiteSource, GitHub Dependabot scanning third-party libraries, automated PR creation for vulnerability fixes, license compliance checking).

Runtime protection: web application firewall (WAF) as virtual patch (mitigates vulnerabilities while code fix in progress, custom rules for business logic attacks, API schema validation, logging all blocked requests for analysis), runtime application self-protection (RASP) detects attacks from within application (Contrast Security, Imperva monitors application behavior, blocks SQL injection, XSS, deserialization attacks in real-time, low false positives compared to WAF).

API security: API gateway as enforcement point (Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway for authentication and authorization, rate limiting per consumer and API, request/response validation against schema, API analytics for anomaly detection), OAuth 2.0/OIDC for API authorization (client credentials flow for service-to-service, authorization code flow for user delegation, JWT tokens with short expiration and refresh rotation, scope-based access control).

Container and cloud-native security: container image security (scan images in CI/CD and registry with Trivy, Snyk, Aqua, minimal base images—distroless, Alpine, scratch, vulnerability SLA—patch critical in 7 days, sign images with Cosign for supply chain security), Kubernetes security (RBAC for least privilege, Pod Security Standards—Restricted for production, network policies deny-by-default, secrets in external vault not in manifests, admission controllers enforce policies—OPA Gatekeeper, Kyverno), serverless security (function-level IAM roles not shared credentials, code scanning for Lambda/Functions, environment variable encryption, VPC integration for private resource access, execution time and memory limits).

**DATA SECURITY ARCHITECTURE**

Protect data at rest and in transit. Data classification: automated classification (4 tiers: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted/PII/PHI/PCI, machine learning classifies documents/emails, data labeling in Office 365, Salesforce with sensitivity labels, user education on proper classification), data inventory (comprehensive catalog of data assets, sensitivity levels assigned, data owners identified, data flow mapping—where data moves, cross-border transfers documented).

Encryption strategy: encryption at rest (full disk encryption—BitLocker, FileVault on all endpoints 100% coverage, database encryption—Transparent Data Encryption for SQL Server, Oracle, cloud storage encryption—S3/Azure Storage/GCS with AES-256, encryption key per tenant for multi-tenant SaaS), encryption in transit (TLS 1.3 minimum for all HTTPS, certificate management via ACM, Let's Encrypt with auto-renewal, internal service-to-service encryption with mTLS, VPN encryption for site-to-site traffic).

Key management: centralized key management (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Cloud KMS for cloud, on-premises HSM for regulated industries—FIPS 140-2 Level 3, envelope encryption—data keys encrypted with master keys, key rotation schedules—annual for root keys, automatic for data keys), customer-managed keys (BYOK for control over encryption, separate keys per environment—production, staging, development, key material never leaves HSM, audit all key usage).

Data loss prevention (DLP): endpoint DLP (Microsoft DLP, Symantec, Digital Guardian monitors file operations, blocks copying PII to USB drives, email attachment scanning and blocking, watermarking sensitive documents), network DLP (inspection at network egress points, SSL/TLS decryption for HTTPS inspection with privacy policy, block uploads of confidential data to personal cloud, integration with CASB), cloud DLP (CASB—Netskope, McAfee MVISION for SaaS applications, discover shadow IT and risky cloud services, enforce encryption for data in cloud, anomaly detection—mass download alerts).

Data protection in applications: secure coding for data (parameterized queries prevent SQL injection and data extraction, output encoding prevents XSS and data leaks, least privilege database users, input validation rejects malformed data), data masking and tokenization (mask PII in non-production environments—test and development, tokenization for payment card data—Stripe, Adyen, format-preserving encryption maintains data format for compatibility), privacy by design (data minimization—collect only necessary data, purpose limitation—use data only for stated purpose, user consent management, right to deletion—GDPR Article 17).

**SECURITY MONITORING AND OPERATIONS**

Detect and respond to threats. SIEM architecture: centralized logging (aggregate logs from all sources—endpoints, servers, network devices, cloud, applications, Windows Event Logs, Linux syslog, AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log, retention per compliance—7 years for SOX, 90 days hot tier for investigation), log analysis and correlation (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Elastic Security for real-time correlation, use case library—150+ correlation rules, MITRE ATT&CK mapping for coverage gaps, threat intelligence integration for IOC matching).

Detection capabilities: signature-based detection (known-bad IOCs from threat intelligence, YARA rules for malware, Snort/Suricata signatures for network attacks), behavioral detection (user behavior analytics—impossible travel, unusual data access, network behavior—lateral movement detection, machine learning for anomaly detection), threat hunting (proactive hypothesis-driven searches, weekly hunts based on intelligence, hunting queries in TIP or SIEM, purple team exercises validate detection).

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR): automated response (Palo Alto XSOAR, Splunk SOAR, Microsoft Sentinel Playbooks automate tier-1 tasks, enrichment—query threat intel, lookup user/asset context, containment—isolate endpoint via EDR, disable account via AD/Azure AD, ticketing—auto-create ServiceNow with evidence), playbooks by incident type (ransomware, phishing, data breach, insider threat with step-by-step procedures), automation philosophy (60%+ of tier-1 tasks automated, human-in-the-loop for tier-2, maintain human judgment for complex investigations).

**GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE ARCHITECTURE**

Establish security governance framework. Policy framework: hierarchical policies (information security policy—overarching principles, standards—technical requirements like encryption standards, procedures—step-by-step how-to guides, guidelines—recommendations and best practices), policy lifecycle (annual review minimum, update within 30 days of regulatory changes, version control and change tracking, executive approval for policy changes).

Security standards and controls: control frameworks (NIST Cybersecurity Framework for risk management, CIS Controls v8 for tactical implementation, ISO 27001 for ISMS certification, industry-specific—PCI-DSS for payments, HIPAA for healthcare, FedRAMP for government cloud), control mapping (map technical controls to framework requirements, document control implementation, evidence collection for audits, continuous compliance monitoring).

Compliance management: regulatory requirements (identify applicable regulations—GDPR for EU data, CCPA for California residents, industry regulations—FINRA for finance, NERC CIP for energy, compliance roadmap with milestones), audit readiness (automated evidence collection via GRC tools, control testing on schedule, remediation tracking for findings, maintain audit artifacts).

Security architecture governance: architecture review board (evaluate new systems for security compliance, approve exceptions to standards with compensating controls, review significant architecture changes, quarterly architecture reviews), security architecture artifacts (reference architectures for common patterns—web application, microservices, data warehouse, security architecture diagrams in enterprise repository, runbooks and implementation guides, decision logs—why certain technologies chosen).

Deliver security architecture as:

1. **ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION** - Layered architecture diagrams, network topology, data flows, trust boundaries

2. **REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES** - Secure patterns for web apps, APIs, microservices, data platforms

3. **CONTROL MATRIX** - Security controls mapped to frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS, ISO 27001, compliance requirements)

4. **TECHNOLOGY STACK** - Selected tools with justification, integration architecture, vendor roadmap

5. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP** - Phased approach, dependencies, milestones, quick wins vs long-term projects

6. **GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK** - Policies, standards, procedures, roles and responsibilities, review cycles
