## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete All Splits (Recommended)
Continue splitting the remaining 3 comprehensive files following the same pattern used for ad-copy:
- Create overview file for each
- Extract focused sections into individual templates
- Maintain 250-400 lines per focused file
- Delete original comprehensive files when complete

### Option 2: Keep Remaining Files As-Is
- Ad-copy splitting is complete and working well
- Motion graphics, UX/UI, and Survey files remain comprehensive
- Users can choose between focused (ad-copy) or comprehensive (others) approaches

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Complete motion-graphics split (most similar to ad-copy in structure)
- Keep UX/UI and Survey as comprehensive (more technical/methodological)
