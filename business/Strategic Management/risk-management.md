# Risk Management Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive risk management frameworks covering risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and compliance requirements to protect organizational value and ensure business continuity.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
```
Company Name: FinServe Corp
Industry: Financial Services
Risk Maturity: Intermediate
Risk Appetite: Moderate-Conservative
Key Risks: Cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, operational continuity
```

### When to Use This
- Establishing enterprise-wide risk management framework with governance structure and policies
- Conducting comprehensive risk assessments across strategic, operational, financial, and compliance categories
- Developing business continuity and crisis management plans for critical scenarios
- Building compliance programs for regulatory requirements and industry standards

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. Identify and assess risks across categories (strategic, operational, financial, compliance) using probability-impact matrix and risk heat maps
2. Develop mitigation strategies (avoidance, reduction, transfer, acceptance) with control implementation and business continuity planning
3. Implement monitoring system with KRIs, risk dashboards, regular reporting, and incident response procedures

**Time to complete:** 4-6 hours for initial framework development; 3-6 months for full program implementation
