# Quality Management Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive quality management systems, manufacturing excellence frameworks, supply chain quality assurance strategies, and continuous improvement programs that ensure product quality, regulatory compliance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency across global manufacturing and supply networks.

## Quick Quality Management Prompt
Implement quality management system for [COMPANY_NAME] manufacturing [PRODUCT_TYPE] with [INDUSTRY_STANDARD] (ISO 9001/IATF 16949/AS9100) certification requirements. Current metrics: [PPM_BASELINE] PPM, [FPY_BASELINE]% FPY, [COQ_BASELINE]% cost of quality. Deploy SPC on [CRITICAL_PROCESSES] critical processes. Implement supplier quality management for [SUPPLIER_COUNT] suppliers. Establish CAPA and audit programs. Target [PPM_TARGET] PPM, [FPY_TARGET]% FPY, [COQ_TARGET]% cost of quality, and [CERTIFICATION_DATE] certification.

## Quick Start

**Get started in 3 steps:**

1. **Assess Current State** - Document your current quality metrics (defect rates, customer complaints, process capability). Benchmark against industry standards for your sector (automotive, aerospace, medical devices, etc.).

2. **Prioritize Quality Gaps** - Identify your top 3 quality issues by cost impact. Focus on defects causing highest scrap/rework costs, customer returns, or compliance risks. Start with one high-impact area.

3. **Launch First Improvement** - Select one critical process with quality issues. Implement basic SPC charts, document standard work, and conduct root cause analysis on top defects. Set 90-day improvement target.

**First Week Actions:**
- Map current quality organizational structure and responsibilities
- Gather baseline data on key quality metrics (PPM, FPY, cost of quality)
- Review existing quality documentation and identify gaps vs. ISO 9001
- Schedule kickoff meeting with quality team and leadership
