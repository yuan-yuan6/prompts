Evaluate facility access determining whether studio space, green screen, production office, and equipment rental houses are secured with appropriate timing.

**3. Technical Execution Readiness**

Assess whether production methodology and workflows ensure quality capture. Evaluate cinematography approach clarity including whether shot composition philosophy, camera movement style, and visual storytelling techniques are defined and communicated. Examine lighting design planning determining whether lighting ratios, mood creation, and practical considerations are mapped to specific scenes and locations. Review audio capture strategy including whether dialogue recording, ambient sound, and backup audio plans address acoustic challenges and ensure clean recordings. Analyze multi-camera coordination determining whether camera positions, synchronization, and coverage patterns are choreographed for complex scenes or events. Assess data management protocols including whether media backup, file naming conventions, on-set review, and asset organization prevent data loss. Evaluate shooting schedule realism determining whether daily call sheets, shot sequences, and contingency time account for setup complexity and location transitions.

**4. Post-Production Workflow Readiness**

Evaluate whether editing infrastructure and talent support delivery requirements. Assess editing platform capability including whether software, hardware, storage, and plugin ecosystem match timeline complexity and effects requirements. Examine editorial team capacity determining whether editors, assistants, and producers possess experience with project length, pacing demands, and revision cycles. Review color grading pipeline including whether colorist expertise, calibrated monitors, and LUT management deliver intended visual aesthetic across deliverable formats. Analyze visual effects scope determining whether compositing, motion graphics, rotoscoping, and 3D elements are achievable within budget and timeline using available talent. Assess audio post-production planning including whether dialogue editing, sound design, foley, music composition, and mixing resources produce broadcast-standard soundtracks. Evaluate revision and approval workflow determining whether version control, stakeholder review cycles, and feedback incorporation are structured to prevent scope creep.

**5. Distribution Strategy Readiness**

Assess whether delivery planning maximizes content reach and impact. Evaluate platform optimization including whether format specifications, aspect ratios, resolution, and codec requirements are understood for YouTube, social media, broadcast, or streaming targets. Examine marketing integration determining whether promotional assets like teasers, trailers, behind-the-scenes content, and social clips are produced during or after principal photography. Review launch timing strategy including whether release scheduling considers audience availability, seasonal factors, competitive content, and marketing campaign coordination. Analyze audience development planning determining whether SEO optimization, thumbnail design, metadata, and distribution timing support discoverability and engagement. Assess monetization readiness including whether sponsorship integration, ad placement, premium content gating, or licensing opportunities are structured into production and distribution. Evaluate success metrics definition determining whether view counts, engagement rates, completion percentages, and ROI targets are established with tracking mechanisms.

**6. Project Management Readiness**

Evaluate whether governance structures and processes ensure on-time, on-budget delivery. Assess budget accuracy and control including whether line-item estimates are realistic, contingencies allocated, and expense tracking systems monitor spending against projections. Examine timeline feasibility determining whether pre-production, shooting, post-production, and delivery milestones account for complexity, dependencies, and revision cycles. Review risk identification including whether production risks like weather, talent availability, equipment failure, or creative changes have mitigation strategies. Analyze communication protocols determining whether production meetings, status updates, stakeholder reviews, and issue escalation paths are defined. Assess quality control standards including whether technical specifications, creative approval checkpoints, and final deliverable review processes are documented. Evaluate team coordination effectiveness determining whether roles, responsibilities, decision rights, and collaboration tools support efficient execution across distributed or co-located teams.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Production Brief** providing project summary, video type and runtime, target platforms and audience, comparable productions, and unique creative approach.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Production Strengths** listing what resources, capabilities, or planning elements are well-developed and position the project for success.

4. **Risk Assessment** identifying potential production, technical, or business risks ranked by likelihood and impact, with recommended mitigation strategies.

5. **Production Roadmap** providing phased timeline: pre-production completion by specific date, principal photography by shoot days, post-production milestones by deliverable type, and distribution launch sequence.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what excellent execution looks like including technical quality benchmarks, creative achievement standards, and audience performance targets.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with unclear vision and inadequate resources, 2.0-2.9 Developing with concepts defined but significant resource gaps, 3.0-3.9 Defined with solid planning and adequate capabilities, 4.0-4.9 Managed with strong resources and proven workflows, 5.0 Optimized with exceptional capabilities and industry-leading quality.
