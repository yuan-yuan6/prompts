# Product Roadmap Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess product roadmap quality and planning maturity across six dimensions: Strategic Alignment, Prioritization Rigor, Stakeholder Communication, Execution Planning, Flexibility & Adaptation, and Team Enablement. This framework identifies roadmapping gaps, strengthens planning processes, and creates improvement roadmaps for effective product direction communication and execution.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive product roadmap readiness assessment for {PRODUCT_CONTEXT}, planning {ROADMAP_SCOPE} to achieve {PLANNING_OBJECTIVES}.

**1. Strategic Alignment Readiness**

Assess whether roadmap connects product execution to company strategy rather than existing as disconnected feature list. Evaluate strategy translation including whether company OKRs and strategic pillars are explicitly linked to roadmap themes, with clear line-of-sight from executive priorities to planned initiatives. Examine outcome orientation determining whether roadmap communicates problems being solved and value delivered versus simply listing features with technical names that obscure customer benefit. Review vision coherence including whether roadmap advances long-term product vision with logical progression, each initiative building toward future state rather than random collection of requests. Analyze market responsiveness determining whether competitive intelligence, market trends, and category evolution inform roadmap direction with adaptation to changing landscape. Assess differentiation focus including whether initiatives strengthen unique value proposition and competitive advantages versus me-too features that don't move strategic positioning. Evaluate investment balance determining whether roadmap allocates appropriate effort to growth, retention, innovation, and operational excellence aligned with business stage and strategy.

**2. Prioritization Rigor Readiness**

Evaluate whether roadmap priorities are determined systematically using frameworks and data versus gut feel or loudest voice. Assess framework consistency including whether RICE scoring, value-versus-effort matrices, or other prioritization methods are applied uniformly across initiatives enabling objective comparison. Examine customer impact weighting determining whether user research, usage data, and customer feedback quantitatively inform priority decisions with documented request frequency and affected user percentages. Review business impact assessment including whether revenue potential, retention impact, and strategic value are estimated for each initiative with clear business case. Analyze effort estimation determining whether engineering effort, design effort, and cross-functional dependencies are assessed realistically based on team velocity and historical accuracy. Assess tradeoff documentation including whether saying no to initiatives includes rationale, alternative approaches considered, and opportunity cost analysis helping stakeholders understand choices. Evaluate priority stability determining whether frequent reprioritization indicates lack of conviction versus appropriate adaptation, with clear criteria for when priorities should change.

**3. Stakeholder Communication Readiness**

Assess whether roadmap is communicated effectively to diverse audiences with appropriate detail and framing. Evaluate audience customization including whether executive view emphasizes strategic themes and business outcomes, engineering view provides implementation detail, customer view manages expectations without over-committing, and sales view enables deal progression. Examine clarity and comprehension determining whether stakeholders understand roadmap without extensive explanation, priorities are self-evident with clear rationale, and ambiguity is eliminated through specific language. Review transparency level including whether roadmap honestly communicates confidence levels, acknowledges uncertainties, and explains changes when they occur building stakeholder trust. Analyze narrative quality determining whether roadmap tells coherent story about product evolution, themes provide organizing structure, and connection between initiatives is obvious. Assess feedback mechanisms including whether stakeholders can easily provide input, roadmap review meetings occur regularly, and suggestions are acknowledged even if not adopted. Evaluate expectation management determining whether stakeholders understand Now-Next-Later framework, differentiate committed items from exploratory ideas, and have realistic delivery timelines.

**4. Execution Planning Readiness**

Evaluate whether roadmap is backed by realistic execution plans rather than aspirational wish lists. Assess resource allocation including whether team capacity is calculated accurately, allocation across themes matches stated priorities, and buffer exists for unplanned work, bugs, and customer escalations. Examine milestone definition determining whether large initiatives are broken into deliverable phases, intermediate milestones provide progress visibility, and dependencies between milestones are mapped. Review dependency management including whether cross-team dependencies are identified early, blocking items are tracked with mitigation plans, and external dependencies on vendors or platforms are acknowledged. Analyze risk identification determining whether technical risks, market risks, and execution risks are surfaced proactively with contingency plans rather than discovered mid-execution. Assess capacity planning including whether hiring plans align with roadmap ambition, skill gaps are identified before critical paths, and ramp time for new team members is factored into timelines. Evaluate scope management determining whether initiatives have clear in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries, V1 versus future versions are defined, and scope creep is prevented through change control processes.

**5. Flexibility & Adaptation Readiness**

Assess whether roadmap enables learning and adaptation versus rigid commitments that ignore new information. Evaluate format flexibility including whether Now-Next-Later structure provides commitment for near-term while maintaining options for future, avoiding false precision on items far out in time. Examine review cadence including whether weekly team reviews track progress, monthly stakeholder reviews assess priority changes, and quarterly comprehensive reviews realign with strategy and learnings. Review change management determining whether process exists for reprioritizing initiatives, criteria for roadmap changes are documented, and stakeholder communication about changes is timely and transparent. Analyze learning integration including whether product experiments, customer feedback, and usage data systematically inform roadmap adjustments versus continuing on predetermined path. Assess assumption testing determining whether key assumptions underlying roadmap are made explicit, validation approaches are defined, and roadmap adapts when assumptions prove incorrect. Evaluate decision speed including whether roadmap changes can be made quickly when market demands, team has authority to adjust within guardrails, and decision-making bottlenecks are minimized.

**6. Team Enablement Readiness**

Evaluate whether roadmap empowers teams to execute effectively with clarity and ownership. Assess priority clarity including whether teams know what to work on without ambiguity, relative priority of concurrent initiatives is obvious, and tradeoff decisions can be made at team level within defined boundaries. Examine ownership assignment determining whether every initiative has designated product manager, engineering lead, and cross-functional owners who are accountable for delivery. Review success metrics definition including whether teams know how success will be measured, leading and lagging indicators are identified, and measurement approach is defined before work begins. Analyze initiative detail level determining whether Now quarter initiatives have sufficient specification for teams to begin work, Next quarter initiatives have enough detail for planning, and Later items are appropriately lightweight. Assess cross-functional coordination including whether dependencies on design, data, legal, or other functions are identified early, required resources are committed, and handoffs are planned. Evaluate autonomy and empowerment determining whether teams can make tactical decisions within strategic direction, escalation paths are clear for blockers, and psychological safety exists to surface risks.

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **Roadmap Overview** providing current planning horizon, key themes, prioritization approach, team structure, and stakeholder landscape.

2. **Readiness Scorecard** presenting a table with maturity score from one to five and key findings for each of the six assessment dimensions.

3. **Roadmap Strengths** listing what's working well including effective practices, strong processes, or communication approaches worth maintaining and scaling.

4. **Planning Gaps** identifying critical weaknesses ranked by impact on execution and stakeholder trust, with specific improvement recommendations.

5. **Improvement Roadmap** providing phased actions: immediate fixes within thirty days addressing critical gaps, process improvements within ninety days strengthening planning rigor, and capability building over six months establishing mature roadmapping practices.

6. **Success Criteria** defining what excellent roadmapping looks like including strategy alignment score, stakeholder satisfaction rating, on-time delivery percentage, and team clarity metrics.

Use this maturity scale: 1.0-1.9 Initial with ad-hoc planning and unclear priorities, 2.0-2.9 Developing with basic roadmap but weak prioritization, 3.0-3.9 Defined with systematic planning and stakeholder communication, 4.0-4.9 Managed with rigorous processes and strong execution, 5.0 Optimized with strategic excellence and continuous improvement.

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Product Roadmap**

Conduct a comprehensive product roadmap readiness assessment for a Series B enterprise software company with four product managers and thirty-five engineers split across platform, integrations, and analytics teams currently struggling with stakeholder misalignment and frequent priority whiplash, planning annual roadmap for 2025 covering Q1 through Q4 with quarterly themes and Now-Next-Later framework for project management platform serving mid-market technology companies, to achieve clear strategic alignment with company OKRs, transparent communication reducing sales and customer success complaints about roadmap changes, and predictable execution with seventy-five percent on-time delivery improving from current fifty percent. The assessment should address strategic alignment gaps examining whether roadmap themes connect to company goals or exist as bottom-up feature aggregation, prioritization inconsistency determining if different stakeholders drive different priorities without systematic framework, stakeholder communication breakdown including why sales team feels blindsided by roadmap changes, resource overcommitment revealing whether capacity planning accounts for reality or wishful thinking, and team clarity issues examining if engineers understand why they're building features and how success is measured.

**Example 2: Consumer Mobile App Roadmap**

Conduct a comprehensive product roadmap readiness assessment for a venture-backed consumer mobile startup with single product manager and eight engineers at early growth stage with product-market fit achieved but struggling to balance growth initiatives with technical debt and customer requests, planning six-month rolling roadmap using Now-Next-Later framework with monthly updates for wellness and habit-tracking app serving millennials and Gen Z, to achieve ruthless prioritization focused on retention and engagement over shiny features, realistic resource allocation accounting for thirty percent time on bugs and performance, and clear communication to investors and advisors about product strategy execution. The assessment should address prioritization discipline examining whether RICE scores or similar framework prevents feature creep from investor suggestions, execution realism determining if single PM can effectively plan and communicate for entire roadmap, technical debt visibility including whether platform stability initiatives are properly weighted versus growth features, stakeholder management assessing whether investors understand Now-Next-Later confidence levels, and team morale issues examining if frequent reprioritization creates exhaustion versus energized focus.

**Example 3: Enterprise Platform Multi-Product Roadmap**

Conduct a comprehensive product roadmap readiness assessment for a large enterprise software company with twenty product managers across five product lines and 200 engineers facing coordination challenges and customer confusion about integrated roadmap, planning eighteen-month strategic roadmap with quarterly detailed plans for customer data platform comprising data ingestion, analytics, activation, and governance modules, to achieve cross-product coordination preventing duplicate work and enabling integrated customer experiences, transparent communication helping customers understand platform evolution, and portfolio-level prioritization ensuring resources flow to highest-value opportunities across products. The assessment should address cross-product dependencies examining whether roadmaps acknowledge integration points or exist in isolation, portfolio prioritization determining if company-level framework allocates resources optimally across products, customer communication complexity including whether customers understand which product team owns which capability, executive visibility assessing whether leadership sees portfolio view versus fragmented plans, and resource contention issues examining if products compete for shared platform or infrastructure resources.
