# Email Writing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to write effective professional emails across six dimensions: goal clarity, structure, tone, persuasion, calls-to-action, and quality/process. This produces a scorecard and a practical improvement plan.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **email writing readiness** for **{EMAIL_CONTEXT}** to **{RECIPIENT_CONTEXT}** within **{CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension **1–5**, explain why, and provide a rewrite strategy (subject line options, structure, CTA, follow-up). Include success metrics.

---

## Template

Conduct an email writing readiness assessment for {EMAIL_CONTEXT} to {RECIPIENT_CONTEXT} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) GOAL & AUDIENCE CLARITY**
- One explicit desired action (approve/decide/reply/schedule)
- Recipient context understood (role, incentives, constraints, relationship)
- Right level of detail for the recipient (what they need to say “yes”)

**2) STRUCTURE & BREVITY**
- Strong subject line (specific, searchable, aligned to request)
- Opening that orients quickly (why now + why them)
- Scannable body (short paragraphs, bullets, headings)

**3) TONE & RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT**
- Tone matches context (formal, friendly, diplomatic, urgent)
- Respectful framing (no guilt, no ambiguity, no passive aggression)
- Trust signals (competence, ownership, empathy)

**4) PERSUASION & EVIDENCE**
- Rationale is credible (data, tradeoffs, risks, alternatives)
- Objections anticipated (cost, time, priority, precedent)
- Clear recommendation with options (when helpful)

**5) CTA & FOLLOW-UP DESIGN**
- CTA is single, specific, time-bounded
- Low-friction next step (links, attachments, proposed times)
- Follow-up plan and escalation path are appropriate

**6) QUALITY & PROCESS**
- Proofreading and clarity check performed
- Sensitive content handled carefully (confidentiality, legal, HR)
- Sending habits support outcomes (timing, threading, version control)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 improvements to implement immediately

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **SCENARIO READINESS**
- Evaluate readiness for 4 common scenarios: request, follow-up, update, difficult message
- For each: main risk, recommended structure, sample CTA

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP**
- A 2-week plan with repeatable patterns (subject formulas, templates, checklists)
- Include a “default email skeleton” and a follow-up cadence rule

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs targets for: response rate, time-to-response, back-and-forth count, decision clarity

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (unclear, high back-and-forth)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some structure, inconsistent outcomes)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable approach, good clarity)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high response quality, persuasive and efficient)
- 5.0: Optimized (excellent outcomes, minimal friction, strong relationships)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {EMAIL_CONTEXT} | Email purpose + topic | “Request approval for Q2 research budget increase” |
| {RECIPIENT_CONTEXT} | Who it’s going to + relationship | “VP Product; supportive but busy; prefers bullets” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “150 words, decision needed by Friday EOD” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {EMAIL_CONTEXT}: Request approval for a $10k Q2 user research budget increase
- {RECIPIENT_CONTEXT}: VP Product; supportive but time-constrained; wants clear tradeoffs
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 150 words; decision needed by Friday EOD; include alternatives

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.7/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 improvements: (1) make CTA binary + time-bounded, (2) quantify ROI, (3) add one clear alternative

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Goal & Audience Clarity | 4.0 | Clear approval request tailored to VP | Add explicit decision options |
| Structure & Brevity | 3.5 | Bullets help scanning | Tighten opening to 1 sentence |
| Tone & Relationship | 4.0 | Respectful and direct | Avoid hedging language |
| Persuasion & Evidence | 3.0 | Mentions value but light on numbers | Add ROI and risk of not doing |
| CTA & Follow-up | 3.5 | Deadline present | Make the action single and explicit |
| Quality & Process | 4.0 | Clean, low risk | Add subject that’s searchable |

3) **SCENARIO READINESS**
- Request: risk = too vague; structure = context → bullets → CTA; CTA = “Approve $10k by Fri EOD?”
- Follow-up: risk = sounding pushy; structure = recap + frictionless choice; CTA = “Is it a yes/no, or should I adjust scope?”
- Update: risk = long status; structure = headline + 3 bullets + ask; CTA = “Anything you want changed?”
- Difficult message: risk = defensiveness; structure = empathy + facts + next steps; CTA = “Confirm you received and agree to X.”

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Unclear decision → missing options → present “approve / approve smaller / not now”
- Gap 2: Weak evidence → no numbers → include ROI estimate and downside risk
- Gap 3: Overlong context → opening bloats → cap to 1–2 sentences
- Gap 4: CTA not frictionless → unclear next step → propose exact action + deadline
- Gap 5: Follow-up ambiguity → inconsistent nudges → define a 48-hour follow-up rule

5) **IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP**
- Week 1: adopt a default skeleton (Subject → Why now → 3 bullets → CTA → Thanks)
- Week 2: build 3 templates (request, follow-up, update) and a subject-line mini-library

Default skeleton:
- Subject: action + topic + deadline
- Opening: 1 sentence context
- Body: 3 bullets (benefit, cost, risk)
- CTA: one specific action + deadline

Follow-up rule:
- Follow up once at 48–72 hours; then escalate with a short “choice” email or async alternative.

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Response rate: 60% → 80%
- Time-to-response: 3.5 days → 2 days
- Back-and-forth: 4 threads → ≤2
- Decision clarity: “maybe” → explicit yes/no/next steps

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Write the CTA first** — everything else supports one action.
2) **Use a searchable subject** — topic + action beats cleverness.
3) **Keep openings short** — orient fast, then get to the ask.
4) **Make it scannable** — bullets, whitespace, and headings reduce cognitive load.
5) **Quantify when persuading** — ROI, risk, and tradeoffs beat adjectives.
6) **Offer a low-friction option** — proposed times, links, or binary choices.
7) **Follow up with a “choice”** — yes/no/adjust scope reduces stalls.
8) **Protect tone under stress** — clarity without sharpness preserves relationships.
