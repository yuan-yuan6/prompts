# Compensation & Benefits Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and operate compensation and benefits programs that are competitive, fair, compliant, and aligned to business strategy.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess compensation and benefits readiness for [ORGANIZATION] across [COUNTRIES] with pay philosophy [PAY_PHILOSOPHY]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Philosophy & strategy, (2) Benchmarking & market data, (3) Job architecture & leveling, (4) Program design & administration, (5) Governance & compliance, (6) Measurement & iteration. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Philosophy & Strategy
- 1 — Initial: Pay philosophy unclear; decisions are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Comp strategy documented; guiding principles and tradeoffs.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is stable and understood; decisions align across organization.

### 2) Benchmarking & Market Data
- 1 — Initial: Market data inconsistent; benchmarking ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Reliable sources; benchmarking process and cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Benchmarks are trusted; updates are timely; decisions are evidence-based.

### 3) Job Architecture & Leveling
- 1 — Initial: Levels unclear; internal equity issues common.
- 3 — Defined: Job families and levels defined; mapping maintained.
- 5 — Optimized: Architecture is consistent; equity and progression improve.

### 4) Program Design & Administration
- 1 — Initial: Programs confusing; administration manual and error-prone.
- 3 — Defined: Program rules documented; administration workflows and tooling.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations scale; employee experience improves; errors decline.

### 5) Governance & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Decision rights unclear; compliance risks unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Governance model; approvals; compliance and audit requirements.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; compliance is auditable and reliable.

### 6) Measurement & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: No tracking of program effectiveness; issues recur.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs and review cadence (equity, compa-ratio, retention).
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves competitiveness and fairness.

## Deliverables
- Comp & benefits readiness scorecard and gap list
- Compensation philosophy and benchmarking approach
- Job architecture and leveling guidance
- Program rules and administration workflows
- Governance and measurement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [COUNTRIES]: Countries/regions
- [PAY_PHILOSOPHY]: Pay philosophy
- [BENCHMARK_SOURCES]: Market data sources
- [EQUITY_METRICS]: Pay equity metrics
- [COMP_CYCLE]: Comp cycle cadence

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Multi-region company formalizing comp bands
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Data 2; Architecture 2; Admin 2; Governance 3; Iteration 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize leveling; pick benchmark sources; define program rules and KPI cadence
