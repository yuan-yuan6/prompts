# Wealth Management Readiness Assessment — Tax, Retirement & Estate

## Purpose
Assess how ready you are to deliver tax-aware wealth planning, retirement income strategy, and estate/legacy planning with reliable inputs, documented assumptions, and decision-linked recommendations.

## Quick Prompt
Assess tax, retirement, and estate readiness for [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME] in [RESIDENCE_TAX_JURISDICTION]. Evaluate tax profile and planning data, account structure and asset location, retirement income needs and timing, distribution sequencing and Roth strategy, estate documents and beneficiary alignment, and ongoing governance (cadence, evidence, advisors). Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Tax Profile, Data & Assumptions
- 1: Tax situation is unclear; prior returns and inputs are missing.
- 3: Baseline tax picture exists; scenario assumptions are partial.
- 5: Reliable inputs and documented assumptions support repeatable planning.

2) Account Structure & Asset Location
- 1: Account types and beneficiaries are inconsistent or unknown.
- 3: Most accounts are mapped; asset location is partially considered.
- 5: Coordinated structure across taxable/qualified/Roth with documentation.

3) Retirement Targets & Timing
- 1: Retirement goals are vague; timing is untested.
- 3: Targets exist; longevity and inflation assumptions are basic.
- 5: Clear targets with sensitivity analysis and tradeoffs documented.

4) Distribution Sequencing & Tax-Aware Decisions
- 1: Withdrawals are improvised; bracket and Medicare effects ignored.
- 3: Sequencing logic exists; Roth conversions are evaluated occasionally.
- 5: Decision-linked sequencing with bracket management and scenario triggers.

5) Estate Documents & Transfer Readiness
- 1: Core documents are missing; beneficiary designations are outdated.
- 3: Documents exist; funding/titling alignment is incomplete.
- 5: Documents, titling, beneficiaries, and governance are aligned and reviewed.

6) Governance, Coordination & Evidence
- 1: Advisor coordination is informal; recommendations aren’t tracked.
- 3: Coordination occurs; action tracking is uneven.
- 5: Roles, cadence, and evidence are clear; actions are tracked to completion.

## Deliverables
- Tax baseline summary (income types, deductions, credits, carryforwards)
- Account map (taxable, qualified, Roth; ownership; beneficiaries)
- Retirement projection summary (targets, assumptions, sensitivities)
- Distribution sequencing and Roth conversion decision memo (with triggers)
- Estate readiness checklist (documents, titling, beneficiaries, actions)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — tax and retirement decisions are year-by-year.
- Level 2: Documented — strategies exist; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — consistent analysis for major decisions.
- Level 4: Managed — scenario-driven decisions with documented triggers.
- Level 5: Optimizing — coordinated multi-year planning and continuous refinement.

## Variables
- [CLIENT_FAMILY_NAME]
- [RESIDENCE_TAX_JURISDICTION]
- [INCOME_SOURCES]
- [ACCOUNT_TYPES]
- [RETIREMENT_TARGET_SPEND]
- [SOCIAL_SECURITY_STRATEGY]
- [ROTH_CONVERSION_CAPACITY]
- [ESTATE_DOCUMENTS_STATUS]

## Example (Condensed)
Pre-retiree with mixed taxable and qualified accounts.
- Plan: multi-year bracket management with partial Roth conversions.
- Distribution: sequence by tax impact and Medicare thresholds.
- Estate: update beneficiaries and align titling with documents.
