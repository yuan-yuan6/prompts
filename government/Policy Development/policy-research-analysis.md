## Best Practices

1. **Use multiple evidence sources** - Triangulate findings across methodologies
2. **Assess evidence quality rigorously** - Document strength and limitations
3. **Learn from comparable jurisdictions** - Identify transferable lessons
4. **Document methodology clearly** - Enable replication and validation
5. **Acknowledge uncertainties** - Be transparent about knowledge gaps
6. **Engage subject matter experts** - Validate findings and interpretation
7. **Consider contextual factors** - Account for local circumstances
8. **Maintain research integrity** - Follow ethical guidelines
9. **Update evidence regularly** - Monitor new research and data
