# Plant Operations Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage plant operations with safety, reliability, predictive maintenance, and performance optimization.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess plant operations readiness for plant [PLANT]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Safety & compliance, (2) Asset monitoring, (3) Maintenance strategy, (4) Process control & optimization, (5) Workforce & SOPs, (6) Governance & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Safety & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Safety processes inconsistent; compliance gaps likely.
- 3 — Defined: Safety program and compliance processes documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Safety culture and controls are mature with continuous improvement.

### 2) Asset Monitoring
- 1 — Initial: Monitoring limited; failures detected late.
- 3 — Defined: Critical assets monitored; thresholds and alerts exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Monitoring is robust; early warning prevents failures.

### 3) Maintenance Strategy
- 1 — Initial: Maintenance reactive; spare parts unmanaged.
- 3 — Defined: Preventive/predictive maintenance plan; spares strategy exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Maintenance is optimized; downtime minimized and predictable.

### 4) Process Control & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Controls manual; performance unstable.
- 3 — Defined: Control strategies documented; optimization initiatives defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization is continuous with reliable controls and measurement.

### 5) Workforce & SOPs
- 1 — Initial: SOPs outdated; training inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: SOPs and training plan exist; roles clear.
- 5 — Optimized: Workforce is well-trained; execution is consistent across shifts.

### 6) Governance & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No cadence for improvement; issues repeat.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence; root cause analysis; reporting pack.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement is systematic and sustained.

## Deliverables
- Plant operations readiness scorecard
- Safety/compliance checklist and audit plan
- Asset monitoring and alerting plan
- Maintenance strategy and spares plan
- Governance cadence and improvement backlog

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PLANT]: Plant name
- [ASSETS]: Critical assets
- [ALERTS]: Alert thresholds
- [MAINTENANCE]: Maintenance approach
- [SAFETY]: Safety requirements
- [KPIS]: KPIs

## Example (Condensed)
- Plant: Natural gas generation facility
- Scores (1–5): Safety 3; Monitoring 2; Maintenance 2; Control 3; Workforce 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Improve monitoring coverage; formalize predictive maintenance; update SOPs and training; establish governance cadence
