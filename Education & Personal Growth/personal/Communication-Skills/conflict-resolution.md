# Conflict Resolution Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to resolve conflicts constructively across six dimensions: Emotional Readiness, Understanding & Empathy, Communication Skills, Problem-Solving Approach, Relationship Context, and Process Management. This framework identifies preparation gaps, prioritizes skill development, and creates effective conflict resolution strategies.

## Template

Assess conflict resolution readiness for {CONFLICT_CONTEXT} involving {PARTIES} addressing {ISSUE}.

Evaluate readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. EMOTIONAL READINESS**
- Emotional regulation and self-control
- Anger, hurt, or defensiveness management
- Ability to stay present without fight-or-flight response
- Recovery from emotional triggers

**2. UNDERSTANDING & EMPATHY**
- Comprehension of other party's perspective
- Assumption checking and curiosity
- Recognition of underlying needs and interests
- Cultural and contextual awareness

**3. COMMUNICATION SKILLS**
- "I" statement usage vs blame language
- Active listening without interrupting
- De-escalation techniques and calming language
- Nonverbal communication awareness (tone, body language)

**4. PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH**
- Solution-focused vs fault-finding mindset
- Win-win option generation capability
- Flexibility and willingness to compromise
- Creative problem-solving under tension

**5. RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT**
- Relationship history and trust level
- Power dynamics and equity considerations
- Stakes and consequences understanding
- Long-term relationship goals

**6. PROCESS MANAGEMENT**
- Timing and setting appropriateness
- Conversation structure and plan
- Follow-up and accountability mechanisms
- Escalation options if resolution fails

## Required Output Format

Deliver your assessment as:

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (X.X/5) and resolution probability
- Top 3 strengths supporting successful resolution
- Top 3 gaps requiring immediate attention
- Recommended approach (direct conversation, mediation, delay, etc.)

**2. DIMENSION SCORECARD**

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding | Priority Actions |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Emotional Readiness | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |
| Understanding & Empathy | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |
| Communication Skills | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |
| Problem-Solving Approach | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |
| Relationship Context | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |
| Process Management | X.X/5 | [finding] | [actions] |

**3. CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGY**
Based on readiness assessment:
- **Timing recommendation:** Proceed now / Wait 24-48 hours / Seek preliminary steps first
- **Format recommendation:** One-on-one / Facilitated mediation / Written first, then verbal
- **Opening approach:** Empathy-first / Solution-focused / Acknowledgment of harm
- **Potential obstacles:** [List 3 likely challenges and mitigation strategies]

**4. CONVERSATION SCRIPT**
Provide opening statement using this structure:
- **Relationship acknowledgment:** "I value our [relationship] and want to address..."
- **I-statement:** "When [specific behavior], I felt [emotion] because [reason]..."
- **Invitation:** "Help me understand your perspective on..."
- **Common ground:** "I believe we both want [shared goal]..."
- **Path forward:** "What if we tried [proposal]? What would work for you?"

**5. RESOLUTION ROADMAP**
- **Pre-conversation:** Emotional preparation, perspective research, script rehearsal
- **During conversation:** Opening, active listening, option generation, agreement building
- **Post-conversation:** Follow-up timeline, accountability check-ins, relationship repair actions

**6. SUCCESS METRICS**
Define success indicators:
- **Immediate:** Conversation completed without escalation, mutual understanding achieved
- **Short-term (1 week):** Agreement honored, tension reduced, communication open
- **Long-term (1 month):** Relationship improved, issue recurrence prevented, trust rebuilt

Use this scale for dimension scoring:

**1.0-1.9 (Reactive):** Highly emotional, unable to see other perspective, blame-focused, no plan

**2.0-2.9 (Emerging):** Some emotional control, limited empathy, basic communication, solution-seeking but rigid

**3.0-3.9 (Capable):** Emotionally regulated, understands other view, effective communication, flexible problem-solving

**4.0-4.9 (Skilled):** Strong emotional management, deep empathy, excellent communication, creative solutions, strategic planning

**5.0 (Masterful):** Exceptional emotional intelligence, sophisticated perspective-taking, expert de-escalation, innovative solutions, relationship strengthening

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| {CONFLICT_CONTEXT} | The setting and nature of the conflict | "Workplace disagreement with colleague", "Family conflict over caregiving decisions", "Dispute with neighbor over property boundaries" |
| {PARTIES} | Who is involved in the conflict | "You and your manager", "You and your spouse", "You, your sibling, and elderly parent", "Team members in project disagreement" |
| {ISSUE} | The specific conflict subject | "Unequal workload distribution", "Different parenting approaches", "Noise complaints and privacy concerns", "Project direction and resource allocation" |

---

## Example

### Input
```
CONFLICT_CONTEXT: "Workplace conflict with peer colleague about project ownership"
PARTIES: "You (senior engineer) and Alex (peer engineer with 2 years less experience)"
ISSUE: "Alex took credit for your algorithm design in team meeting; you feel undermined and angry"
```

### Output
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overall Readiness: 2.8/5 (Emerging)
Resolution Probability: Moderate with emotional preparation

Top 3 Strengths:
1. Clear awareness of specific grievance (credit attribution)
2. Stake in relationship preservation (ongoing collaboration needed)
3. Identified solution space (attribution correction, process improvement)

Top 3 Gaps:
1. High emotional activation (anger, feeling undermined) risks escalation
2. Limited perspective on Alex's motivations (assumption vs evidence)
3. No concrete plan for conversation structure or setting

Recommended Approach: Delay 24-48 hours for cooling off, then direct one-on-one conversation in private setting

---

DIMENSION SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding | Priority Actions |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Emotional Readiness | 2.0/5 | Still feeling angry and undermined; risk of accusatory tone | Take 24-hour cooling period, journal feelings, practice deep breathing before conversation |
| Understanding & Empathy | 2.5/5 | Focused on own hurt; haven't considered Alex's perspective | List 3 possible innocent explanations for Alex's behavior, recall past positive interactions |
| Communication Skills | 3.5/5 | Capable of "I" statements but may slip into "you always" under stress | Rehearse opening with friend, prepare specific examples, avoid "always/never" language |
| Problem-Solving Approach | 3.0/5 | Seeking resolution but unclear what outcome would satisfy | Define ideal outcome (apology? correction? process change?) and acceptable compromises |
| Relationship Context | 3.5/5 | Understand importance of peer relationship but seniority complicates dynamics | Acknowledge Alex's contributions while advocating for accurate attribution |
| Process Management | 2.5/5 | No plan for timing, setting, or follow-up | Schedule 30-min private meeting, choose neutral space, plan follow-up check-in |

CONFLICT RESOLUTION STRATEGY

**Timing Recommendation:** Wait 48 hours
- Current emotional state (anger) creates escalation risk
- Need time to research Alex's perspective and prepare emotionally
- Allows opportunity to rehearse approach with trusted colleague

**Format Recommendation:** One-on-one, in-person, in private meeting room
- Avoid email/chat (nuance loss, paper trail creates defensiveness)
- Private setting reduces Alex's face-saving pressures
- In-person allows reading nonverbal cues and building rapport

**Opening Approach:** Relationship-first with specific, factual observation
- Start with recognition of Alex's contributions to build goodwill
- Use specific factual statement: "In yesterday's meeting, the Dijkstra optimization was attributed to you. I designed that algorithm."
- Avoid: "You stole my credit" or "You always take my ideas"

**Potential Obstacles & Mitigation:**
1. **Alex becomes defensive:** Respond with "I'm not attacking you, I want to understand what happened. Walk me through your perspective."
2. **Alex claims independent discovery:** "It's possible we converged, but I documented my design on [date]. Can we review our notes together?"
3. **Conversation derails to other grievances:** "Let's focus on this specific instance first, then we can address other concerns separately."

---

CONVERSATION SCRIPT

**Opening (Relationship + Specific Observation):**
"Alex, I value our collaboration on this project and appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. I want to address something from yesterday's meeting that's been bothering me. When the Dijkstra optimization was discussed, I noticed it was presented as your work. I designed that algorithm three weeks ago—I have the commit history and design doc from October 23rd. I'm confused about what happened and want to understand your perspective."

**Active Listening Prompt:**
"Help me understand how this situation looked from your side. What was your thinking when presenting that work?"

[Listen without interrupting. Reflect back: "So you're saying you [restate their explanation]. Is that right?"]

**Common Ground Statement:**
"I think we both want this project to succeed and want our team to have accurate information. We both care about doing good work and getting appropriate recognition for our contributions."

**Solution Proposal:**
"Here's what I'd like: In our next team meeting, could we clarify the attribution? Something like, 'To clarify from last week, the optimization approach came from [your name]'s initial design, which I then implemented with [specific additions].' Would that work for you? What would make this right from your perspective?"

**Process Improvement:**
"Going forward, how can we make sure we're accurately crediting work? Maybe we could document design decisions with author names in our technical specs?"

**Closing:**
"I appreciate you taking time to talk through this. Let's check in after Friday's meeting to make sure we're on the same page. Thanks for being open to this conversation."

RESOLUTION ROADMAP

**PRE-CONVERSATION (24-48 hours before):**
- Emotional preparation:
  - Journal about feelings to process anger separately from facts
  - Practice 4-7-8 breathing technique (4 sec inhale, 7 sec hold, 8 sec exhale)
  - Visualize successful conversation outcome
  
- Perspective research:
  - Review project timeline and documentation for factual clarity
  - Talk to neutral colleague who attended meeting for objective perspective
  - List 3 charitable interpretations of Alex's behavior (misunderstanding vs malice)
  
- Script rehearsal:
  - Practice opening statement with friend or mentor
  - Rehearse staying calm if Alex becomes defensive
  - Prepare 3 solution options (correction, process change, both)

**DURING CONVERSATION (30-minute private meeting):**
- Opening (5 min):
  - Start with relationship acknowledgment and appreciation
  - State specific factual observation without accusatory tone
  - Express confusion rather than anger: "I'm puzzled" vs "I'm furious"

- Active listening (10 min):
  - Ask open-ended question about Alex's perspective
  - Don't interrupt, let them fully explain
  - Reflect back what you hear without agreeing/disagreeing
  - Ask clarifying questions: "When you said X, did you mean Y?"

- Option generation (10 min):
  - Propose your ideal solution
  - Ask for their ideas: "What would make this right from your view?"
  - Find middle ground if perspectives differ
  - Focus on future process, not just past correction

- Agreement building (5 min):
  - Summarize agreement: "So we've agreed to..."
  - Specify actions: "You'll do X by Friday, I'll do Y"
  - Schedule follow-up: "Let's check in next Monday"
  - Thank them for engaging constructively

**POST-CONVERSATION (1 week follow-up):**
- Immediate (same day):
  - Document agreement in writing (friendly email: "Thanks for the productive conversation. As we discussed, [summary]")
  - Debrief with mentor or trusted colleague to process
  
- Short-term (1 week):
  - Check if agreed actions happened (correction in meeting, process change)
  - Assess tension level in interactions: Is Alex avoiding you? Are you comfortable collaborating?
  - Follow up conversation if agreement wasn't honored
  
- Long-term (1 month):
  - Evaluate relationship repair: Are you collaborating effectively?
  - Assess issue recurrence: Has attribution been accurate since?
  - Consider relationship strengthening actions: Recognize Alex's work publicly, invite to coffee, collaborate on new task
