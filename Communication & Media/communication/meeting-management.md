# Meeting Management & Effectiveness Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run **high-value, well-facilitated meetings** that produce clear decisions, actionable outcomes, and engaged participants. Use this to diagnose gaps in agenda discipline, facilitation skills, and meeting culture.

## Template

Conduct a meeting management & effectiveness readiness assessment for {MEETING_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (meeting time spent, satisfaction scores, action item completion, decision speed).

**1) MEETING NECESSITY & DESIGN**
- Meetings have clear objectives and success criteria (not just "discuss")
- Meeting necessity is evaluated (could this be an email/doc/async update?)
- Attendee lists are right-sized (only essential participants)
- Meeting types are fit-for-purpose (standup, decision, brainstorm, update)

**2) AGENDA DISCIPLINE & PREPARATION**
- Agendas are sent 24+ hours in advance with objectives and pre-reads
- Agendas include time allocations, decision points, and roles
- Pre-reads are consumed before the meeting (not presented during)
- Topics are scoped and sequenced to optimize energy and decision quality

**3) FACILITATION & PARTICIPATION**
- Facilitators are trained and effective (timekeeping, engagement, neutrality)
- Participation is balanced (no dominant speakers; quiet voices are heard)
- Discussions stay on-topic; parking lot captures tangents
- Energy is managed (breaks, pacing, activities, format variety)

**4) DECISION QUALITY & DOCUMENTATION**
- Decision process is clear (consensus, vote, consult-and-decide, delegation)
- Decisions are documented with context, owners, and communication plans
- Dissent is captured when consensus isn't reached
- Action items have owners, deadlines, and success criteria

**5) FOLLOW-THROUGH & ACCOUNTABILITY**
- Meeting notes are sent within 2 hours (decisions, actions, next steps)
- Action items are tracked in a system and reviewed in next meeting
- Completion rate is >80%; blockers are surfaced and resolved
- Meeting effectiveness is measured and improved

**6) MEETING CULTURE & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Meeting overload is monitored and reduced (calendar audits, no-meeting days)
- Meetings are safe spaces for dissent, questions, and candor
- Meeting effectiveness is retrospected and improved
- Norms exist and are reinforced (start on time, cameras on, phones away)

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, meeting culture risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **MEETING LANDSCAPE AUDIT**
- Total meeting hours/week, meeting types, attendee counts, recurring vs. ad hoc
- Meeting ROI estimation (value vs. cost in participant time)

4) **MEETING EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS**
- Satisfaction scores, action item completion rates, decision speed
- Common failure modes (no agenda, overrun, no decisions, poor participation)

5) **FACILITATION CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**
- Facilitator skill levels, training coverage, and common gaps
- Agenda quality, time management, and participation equity

6) **30/60/90-DAY MEETING OPTIMIZATION PLAN**
- Actions to improve necessity, agendas, facilitation, and accountability
- Metrics (meeting hours reduced, satisfaction, action item completion, decision speed)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (no agendas, poor facilitation, low value, high frustration)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic agendas, inconsistent quality, mixed satisfaction)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid agendas, skilled facilitation, clear outcomes)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high satisfaction, strong accountability, continuous improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (best-in-class meetings, maximum ROI, exemplary culture)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {MEETING_CONTEXT}: Org size, meeting hours/week, satisfaction scores, culture challenges
- {OBJECTIVES}: Meeting reduction, satisfaction, action completion, and decision speed goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Facilitator capacity, training budget, geographic spread, cultural norms

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {MEETING_CONTEXT}: 250-person software company. Avg 15 hours/week in meetings per employee (goal 10). Last engagement survey: 38% "meetings are effective" (goal 75%), 45% "I have time for focused work." Action item completion: 62% (goal 85%). Common complaints: "too many meetings," "no agendas," "nothing gets decided."
- {OBJECTIVES}: Reduce meeting hours to 10/week, increase "meetings are effective" to 75%, achieve 85% action item completion, cut decision time from 3 meetings avg to 1.5 meetings.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 30 managers (varying facilitation skills); no dedicated meeting training budget; hybrid work (timezones complicate scheduling); cultural norm of "invite everyone to be inclusive."

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.5 (Developing)
- Key risks: 15 hrs/week in meetings = 38% of work time; low satisfaction drives disengagement; slow decisions hurt velocity
- Top improvements: (1) cut recurring meetings by 20% (necessity audit), (2) require agendas 24h in advance, (3) train managers on facilitation

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Meeting Necessity & Design: 2/5 — recurring meetings not audited; attendee lists bloated; many could be emails
- Agenda Discipline & Preparation: 2/5 — only 40% of meetings have agendas; sent <1h before or during meeting
- Facilitation & Participation: 3/5 — some skilled facilitators; dominant speakers common; time overruns 60%
- Decision Quality & Documentation: 2/5 — decisions unclear; dissent not captured; action items vague ("follow up")
- Follow-Through & Accountability: 2/5 — notes sent 50% of time; action items tracked ad hoc; 62% completion
- Meeting Culture & Improvement: 3/5 — some no-meeting Fridays; overload acknowledged but not addressed

**3) MEETING LANDSCAPE AUDIT**
- Total meeting hours/week (250 employees): 3,750 hours = $375K/week in labor cost (@$100/hr avg)
- Meeting types: 45% recurring team syncs, 25% project/program reviews, 15% brainstorms/planning, 10% 1-on-1s, 5% all-hands
- Attendee counts: avg 8 attendees/meeting (range 2–30); 30% of attendees passive (don't speak)
- Recurring vs. ad hoc: 70% recurring (many on autopilot for 1+ years), 30% ad hoc
- Meeting ROI estimation:
  - High value (25%): decisions made, actions clear, satisfaction >7/10 = $94K/week value
  - Medium value (40%): some progress, mixed satisfaction = $150K/week value
  - Low value (35%): no clear outcome, could be email = $131K/week waste
  - ROI: $244K value vs. $375K cost = -35% ROI (losing $131K/week)

**4) MEETING EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS**
- Satisfaction scores (1-10 scale, from pulse surveys): avg 5.2 (goal 7.5)
  - High satisfaction (7+): 25% of meetings (clear agendas, skilled facilitators, decisions made)
  - Medium satisfaction (4–7): 50% of meetings (some structure, mixed outcomes)
  - Low satisfaction (<4): 25% of meetings (no agenda, overrun, no decisions)
- Action item completion rates: 62% (goal 85%)
  - Reasons for incompletion: vague ownership (40%), unrealistic deadlines (30%), blockers (20%), forgotten (10%)
- Decision speed: avg 3 meetings to make a decision (goal 1.5)
  - Reasons for delays: unclear decision process, missing stakeholders, insufficient pre-work, reopening decided issues
- Common failure modes:
  - No agenda (60% of meetings): participants unprepared, discussion unfocused
  - Time overruns (60% of meetings): poor time management, no parking lot, too many topics
  - No clear decisions (45% of meetings): "we'll revisit" = endless loops
  - Poor participation (40% of meetings): 3 people dominate, rest silent or multitasking

**5) FACILITATION CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**
- Facilitator skill levels (30 managers assessed via 360 feedback + observation):
  - High skill (8+/10): 20% of managers (agenda masters, time discipline, engagement)
  - Medium skill (5–8/10): 50% of managers (basic competence, room for improvement)
  - Low skill (<5/10): 30% of managers (no agendas, lose control of time/topic, unbalanced participation)
- Training coverage: 25% of managers attended facilitation training (1-day workshop 2 years ago)
- Common gaps:
  - Agenda quality: vague objectives ("discuss project"), no time allocations, sent last-minute
  - Time management: 60% overrun by 5–15 minutes; no parking lot; can't cut discussion short
  - Participation equity: 30% of meetings dominated by 1–2 people; remote participants ignored
  - Decision discipline: unclear decision process; "let's sleep on it" = no decision
  - Follow-through: notes delayed or missing; action items not tracked

**6) 30/60/90-DAY MEETING OPTIMIZATION PLAN**
- 30 days: audit all recurring meetings (necessity, attendees, frequency); cut 20% (estimate 3 hrs/week/person saved = $75K/week); mandate agendas 24h in advance (track compliance); launch "No Meeting Fridays" company-wide
- 60 days: train all 30 managers on facilitation (4-hour workshop: agenda design, time management, participation, decision capture); pilot meeting note templates (decisions, actions, next steps); introduce action item tracker (integrated with project management tool)
- 90 days: measure meeting satisfaction (goal 6.0), action item completion (goal 75%), meeting hours (goal 12/week); retrospect top 10 recurring meetings (what's working, what to improve); refine training based on feedback
- Metrics: meeting hours (goal 12/week by 90 days), "meetings effective" (goal 55%), action completion (goal 75%), decision speed (goal 2.5 meetings avg)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Audit recurring meetings quarterly: kill, combine, or reduce frequency—default to 25-minute or 50-minute slots.
2) Require agendas 24 hours in advance with objectives, pre-reads, and decision points—no agenda, no meeting.
3) Right-size attendee lists: invite only essential participants; send notes to "optional" attendees instead.
4) Train facilitators on timekeeping, parking lot discipline, and balanced participation—it's a skill, not innate.
5) Make decisions explicit: state the process (vote, consensus, consult-and-decide), document the outcome, capture dissent.
6) Send meeting notes within 2 hours with decisions, action items (owner, deadline), and next steps—no exceptions.
7) Track action items in a system and review completion rates—hold owners accountable and surface blockers.
8) Measure and improve: survey satisfaction, track time spent, retrospect effectiveness, and iterate relentlessly.
