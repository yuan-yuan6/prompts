# Lesson Objectives & Design

## Purpose
Define clear, measurable learning objectives aligned with standards and design an effective lesson structure that promotes student achievement.

## Template

```
### 1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Subject: [SUBJECT_AREA]
Grade Level: [GRADE_LEVEL]
Lesson Duration: [LESSON_DURATION] minutes

Cognitive Objectives:
- Knowledge: [KNOWLEDGE_OBJECTIVE]
- Comprehension: [COMPREHENSION_OBJECTIVE]
- Application: [APPLICATION_OBJECTIVE]
- Analysis: [ANALYSIS_OBJECTIVE]
- Synthesis: [SYNTHESIS_OBJECTIVE]
- Evaluation: [EVALUATION_OBJECTIVE]

Affective Objectives:
- Attitudes: [ATTITUDE_OBJECTIVE]
- Values: [VALUE_OBJECTIVE]
- Appreciation: [APPRECIATION_OBJECTIVE]

Psychomotor Objectives (if applicable):
- Skills: [SKILL_OBJECTIVE]
- Coordination: [COORDINATION_OBJECTIVE]
- Technique: [TECHNIQUE_OBJECTIVE]

### 2. STANDARDS ALIGNMENT
Academic Standards:
- Common Core/State Standard: [STANDARD_CODE]
- Learning Target: [LEARNING_TARGET]
- Success Criteria: [SUCCESS_CRITERIA]

Cross-Curricular Connections:
- Subject 1: [CROSS_CURRICULUM_1]
- Subject 2: [CROSS_CURRICULUM_2]

### 3. LESSON STRUCTURE
Opening (5-10 min):
- Hook/Attention grabber: [LESSON_HOOK]
- Prior knowledge activation: [PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE_ACTIVATION]
- Objective sharing: [OBJECTIVE_SHARING_METHOD]

Development (25-40 min):
- Instructional sequence: [INSTRUCTIONAL_SEQUENCE]
- Key concepts: [KEY_CONCEPTS]
- Examples and non-examples: [EXAMPLES]

Practice (15-20 min):
- Guided practice: [GUIDED_PRACTICE_ACTIVITY]
- Independent practice: [INDEPENDENT_PRACTICE_ACTIVITY]

Closure (5-10 min):
- Summary: [LESSON_SUMMARY_METHOD]
- Exit ticket: [EXIT_TICKET]
- Preview next lesson: [NEXT_LESSON_PREVIEW]

### 4. PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
Students should know:
- Concept 1: [PREREQUISITE_1]
- Concept 2: [PREREQUISITE_2]

```

## Best Practices
- Write SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Align objectives with assessments
- Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy
- Share objectives with students
- Connect to real-world applications
- Build on prior knowledge
- Scaffold learning progressively
