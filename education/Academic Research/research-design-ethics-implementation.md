"Create comprehensive plan for Phase III drug trial across 20 sites. Full IRB protocol with DSMB oversight, adverse event reporting system. 3-year timeline with quarterly monitoring visits. GCP-compliant procedures, central randomization, blinded outcome assessment. Budget $5M with detailed site-level allocations."

### Example 3: Educational Intervention Study

District IRB approval, parental consent procedures, student assent. 2-year timeline: Year 1 implementation, Year 2 sustainability. Fidelity monitoring, teacher training protocols. Risk mitigation for teacher turnover and administrative changes."

## Best Practices

1. **Submit IRB early** - Ethics review takes longer than expected; start the process early
2. **Engage communities from the beginning** - Build relationships before requesting participation
3. **Use clear, accessible consent language** - Avoid jargon and ensure comprehension
4. **Plan for the unexpected** - Build contingency time and budget into all plans
5. **Communicate regularly with stakeholders** - Keep everyone informed of progress and challenges
6. **Document everything** - Maintain detailed records of decisions, changes, and issues
7. **Monitor quality continuously** - Don't wait until the end to check quality
8. **Respect cultural protocols** - Adapt procedures to cultural norms and values
9. **Build in flexibility** - Plans will need to change; design systems that can adapt
10. **Celebrate milestones** - Acknowledge team achievements to maintain motivation

## Tips for Success

- Start building community relationships 6-12 months before formal recruitment
- Create detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all key activities
- Use project management software to track tasks, timelines, and responsibilities
- Hold regular team meetings with clear agendas and documented decisions
- Establish communication protocols for urgent issues and routine updates
- Create a centralized document repository accessible to all team members
- Build redundancy into critical roles in case of staff turnover
- Schedule regular check-ins with IRB liaison to stay ahead of compliance issues
- Maintain detailed financial tracking to avoid budget surprises
- Create visual timeline displays (Gantt charts) that team members can reference

## Customization Options

1. **Regulatory Context**: Adapt for different institutional review processes, international ethics requirements, multi-site coordination, or special populations requiring additional oversight and protection measures

2. **Cultural Adaptation**: Customize consent processes, community engagement approaches, and ethical frameworks for diverse cultural contexts, indigenous research partnerships, or international collaborations

3. **Project Scale**: Scale from single-investigator studies to large multi-site trials with appropriate project management complexity, oversight structures, and resource allocation frameworks

4. **Risk Profile**: Adjust risk management depth based on study risk level - from minimal risk observational studies to higher-risk intervention trials requiring extensive monitoring and safety protocols

5. **Implementation Complexity**: Modify for simple single-phase studies versus complex multi-phase, adaptive, or pragmatic trials requiring sophisticated implementation strategies and quality assurance systems
