# Financial Forecasting Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to produce forecasting outputs that are consistent, decision-grade, and repeatable (budgets, board packs, fundraising models, M&A cases).

## Quick Prompt
Assess forecasting readiness for [COMPANY_NAME] over [FORECAST_PERIOD]. Score the current forecasting process across: inputs/data, assumptions discipline, model design, scenario/sensitivity rigor, review/controls, and cadence/communication. Provide scores (1–5), key gaps, and the next 3 improvements.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Inputs, Data & Reconciliation
- 1: Inputs are manual; statements don’t reconcile.
- 3: Historical base exists; reconciliation is periodic.
- 5: Traceable sources, reconciliation checks, and consistent definitions.

2) Assumptions & Driver Library
- 1: Assumptions live in prose; no ownership.
- 3: Key assumptions listed; partial tracking.
- 5: Assumption register (owner/source/date) and driver-based forecasting.

3) Model Architecture & Transparency
- 1: Hard-coded cells; unclear logic.
- 3: Structured tabs and summaries.
- 5: Clear input/model/output separation and explainable mechanics.

4) Scenarios & Sensitivities
- 1: Single case only.
- 3: Base/bull/bear and a few sensitivities.
- 5: Driver-based scenarios, stress tests, and implications documented.

5) Review, QA & Controls
- 1: No review checklist; errors discovered late.
- 3: Reviews occur for major cycles.
- 5: QA gates, version control, and sign-offs are standard.

6) Cadence, Alignment & Communication
- 1: Forecasts are sporadic; stakeholders surprised.
- 3: Monthly/quarterly cadence.
- 5: Integrated planning calendar, clear owners, and aligned narratives.

## Deliverables
- Forecast brief (purpose, horizon, scenario set, decision questions)
- Assumption register (drivers, ranges, owners, sources)
- Pro forma P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow (as applicable)
- KPI bridge (revenue drivers, margin drivers, working capital)
- Scenario and sensitivity summary with actions/contingencies

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — inconsistent inputs and models.
- Level 2: Documented — templates exist but are not enforced.
- Level 3: Repeatable — driver-based approach used for most cycles.
- Level 4: Managed — scenarios, QA, and governance are standard.
- Level 5: Optimizing — forecasts improve via feedback and measured accuracy.

## Variables
- [COMPANY_NAME]
- [INDUSTRY_SECTOR]
- [FORECAST_PERIOD] (e.g., 2026–2028)
- [HISTORICAL_YEARS]
- [REVENUE_DRIVERS] (volume, price, churn, ARPA)
- [COST_DRIVERS] (headcount, COGS rates, CAC)
- [WORKING_CAPITAL_ASSUMPTIONS] (DSO/DIO/DPO)
- [SCENARIOS] (base, upside, downside)

## Example (Condensed)
3-year forecast for a B2B SaaS company.
- Inputs: 3 years actuals reconciled to audited statements.
- Drivers: bookings, churn, ARPA; headcount plan by function.
- Scenarios: downside churn +200 bps; CAC +15%; slower enterprise ramp.
- Outputs: pro forma P&L + cash runway and funding needs.
