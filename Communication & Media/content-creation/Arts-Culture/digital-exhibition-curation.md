# Digital Exhibition Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess a digital exhibition or virtual museum project's readiness for development and launch across six dimensions: Narrative & Content Strategy, Digital Asset Creation & Management, Interactive Experience Design, Technical Infrastructure & Platform, Accessibility & Inclusion, and Audience Engagement & Impact. This framework identifies curatorial gaps, validates technical capabilities, and ensures compelling visitor experiences before committing development resources and budget.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive digital exhibition readiness assessment for {EXHIBITION_TITLE}, featuring {COLLECTION_SCOPE} and targeting {TARGET_AUDIENCE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. NARRATIVE & CONTENT STRATEGY READINESS** — Evaluating whether exhibition narrative achieves compelling storytelling through clear thematic framework (central theme or thesis statement articulating exhibition purpose and distinguishing from similar projects, story arc with beginning establishing context, middle developing complexity, and ending providing resolution or call to action, sub-themes supporting main narrative without fragmenting visitor attention, emotional journey designed to move visitors from curiosity through engagement to reflection or action, cultural and historical context providing necessary background for understanding without overwhelming, contemporary relevance connecting historical or cultural content to visitor's present-day life and concerns, narrative coherence ensuring all elements support rather than distract from central story), examining whether visitor journey design creates effective progression through spatial or conceptual flow (entry experience establishing expectations and orienting visitors to exhibition structure and navigation, sequential sections or galleries progressing logically through chronology, geography, theme, or other organizing principle, transitional moments between sections providing cognitive breaks and preparing for new content or perspective, climax or focal point where narrative reaches peak impact through significant object, revelation, or emotional experience, conclusion offering reflection, synthesis, or actionable outcomes rather than abrupt ending, pacing variation mixing dense information with breathing room, active with passive, cerebral with emotional, alternative paths for different visitor interests or time availability enabling personalized journeys, estimated duration aligned with digital attention spans typically 15-45 minutes for general audiences), determining whether content depth balances scholarship with accessibility through appropriate layering (object or artifact selection choosing items genuinely supporting narrative not padding collection, primary interpretive layer providing essential information accessible to all visitors regardless of expertise, secondary layer offering deeper context, scholarship, or connections for engaged learners, tertiary layer including primary sources, scholarly essays, or research materials for specialists and students, label writing clear and concise at primary level avoiding jargon while maintaining accuracy, extended descriptions providing rich detail for those wanting more without overwhelming others, multimedia content—video, audio, interactive—enhancing not replacing text or objects, avoiding information overload where too many elements compete for attention), assessing whether educational objectives define learning outcomes through intentional design (knowledge outcomes specifying what visitors should know or understand after experience, skill outcomes identifying capabilities visitors develop such as

Exhibition narrative compelling and well-developed (central theme clearly articulated connecting historical migration to contemporary immigrant experiences creating relevance, story arc following chronological and personal journeys from Southern roots through Northern challenges to community building and ongoing legacies, sub-themes addressing economic push/pull factors, racial violence and Jim Crow catalysts, urban adaptation challenges, cultural preservation and transformation, family dynamics across generations, emotional arc designed moving from hardship and trauma through resilience and agency to reflection on ongoing relevance creating satisfying journey, cultural and historical context providing necessary background on Jim Crow, World War I/II industrial demand, Northern racism, and Civil Rights movement contextualizing without overwhelming). Visitor journey thoughtfully designed (entry establishing personal connection asking visitors about their own family migration stories creating immediate investment, sequential sections organized chronologically with personal stories within each period humanizing statistics, transitions using maps and demographic data providing cognitive breaks and orientation, climax featuring powerful testimony about racial violence motivations and Northern racism encounters creating emotional peak, conclusion inviting reflection on contemporary immigration debates and visitor own identity stories creating actionable contemporary relevance, pacing variation mixing intensive oral history listening with visual photograph browsing and document exploration, estimated duration 30-40 minutes appropriate for digital context, alternative paths allowing visitors to explore by individual stories, themes, or chronology enabling personalization). Content depth appropriate (45 oral histories providing authentic voices—curator selected compelling excerpts 2-5 minutes each from longer interviews with full transcripts available for deep dive, photographs with basic captions plus extended descriptions for context and identification, documents transcribed and annotated making accessible, artifacts with 360-degree views and detailed provenance, three-tier information architecture with overview, intermediate, and scholarly layers working effectively, multimedia balance between listening-intensive oral histories and visual browsing preventing fatigue). Educational objectives clearly defined (knowledge outcomes: understanding push/pull factors, appreciating individual agency within structural constraints, recognizing continuing relevance; skill outcomes: primary source analysis, empathy and perspective-taking, critical thinking about migration; attitudinal outcomes: challenging stereotypes, valuing immigrant contributions, connecting past and present; curriculum alignment drafted for US History standards grades 8-12 and potential for elementary adaptation).

**Strengths:** Curator expertise and passion driving narrative excellence, oral history collection genuinely distinctive and emotionally powerful regional asset, contemporary relevance naturally connecting historical content to present-day debates, community relationships with descendants providing authentic voices and review, thematic clarity making complex historical period accessible without oversimplification.

**Moderate Gap:** Digital medium advantages partially considered but not fully leveraged—opportunities for interactive comparison tools, personalization algorithms, or participatory elements underdeveloped in current conception, needs UX design expertise translating strong narrative into optimal digital experience, single curator developing content creating bandwidth constraint for expanding and refining.

- **Digital Asset Creation & Management: 2.3/5.0** — Significant deficiencies. Digitization 60% complete (27/45 oral histories digitized professionally—high quality audio with transcripts, 78/120 photographs scanned at 600 DPI with basic metadata, 12/30 documents scanned at 300 DPI color, 6/15 artifacts photographed multiple angles basic consumer camera not professional, remaining 40% waiting on access permissions from family collections or vendor scheduling delays). Asset quality inconsistent (oral histories excellent with broadcast-quality audio and professional transcription, photographs good quality scans but inconsistent color calibration across different scanning sessions creating visual discontinuity, documents adequate but several difficult-to-read handwritten items needing enhancement, artifacts amateur photography with inconsistent lighting and backgrounds not exhibition-ready requiring reshoot $3-5K). Metadata completeness poor (oral histories have full descriptive metadata identifying speaker, interviewer, date, location, topics, and timecodes for key passages facilitating access, photographs have basic title, date, location but missing detailed identifications—many subjects unidentified limiting interpretation and searchability, documents similarly under-described, artifacts have catalog records but not optimized for digital discovery, no controlled vocabularies used—free-text tagging inconsistent across collection, technical metadata incomplete—file formats, resolution, equipment documented inconsistently). Rights clearance problematic (oral histories cleared with signed releases from interviewees or estates establishing permissions for educational use, photographs mixed status—institutional ownership for 40%, donor permissions for 35% verbal not written requiring follow-up, 25% uncertain status with orphan works or unclear provenance requiring risk assessment and diligent search, documents similarly mixed, artifacts mostly institutional ownership but 3 items on loan requiring permission, no comprehensive rights database—information scattered in paper files and emails creating vulnerability). No asset management system (files stored on IT coordinator's workstation and external drive—no centralized repository, basic folder organization by type and date but no search capability, no version control—multiple edited versions scattered, no backup beyond external drive and occasional cloud uploads, no workflow for new digitization—ad hoc process not systematic, scaling to full 210+ assets manageable but inefficient and risky without DAM).

**Strengths:** Oral history digitization quality professional and rights cleared providing exhibition core, photography resolution adequate for web display with zoom capability, institutional ownership of most materials reducing rights complexity, small collection size making manual asset management painful but possible unlike massive collections requiring sophisticated DAM.

**Critical Gaps:** 40% digitization incomplete blocking full exhibition development—needs completion within 3 months to meet 18-month timeline, artifact photography amateur quality insufficient for professional exhibition requiring $3-5K reshoot, rights documentation incomplete creating legal risk particularly for photographs—need attorney consultation and diligent orphan works search, no asset management system creating workflow inefficiency and loss/corruption risk—evaluate Omeka, ResourceSpace, or simple DAM implementation, metadata inconsistency and incompleteness hindering discoverability and long-term management—metadata remediation project essential.

- **Interactive Experience Design: 2.1/5.0** — Major gaps. No UX designer or interactive designer on staff (curator envisioning experience but lacking specialized expertise in digital interaction design, IT coordinator technical implementer not designer, no budget allocated for UX/UI design professional—would need $15-25K for freelancer or reallocating from development budget). Exhibition concept traditional gallery metaphor (envisioning digital "rooms" with photographs on "walls" and audio playing when objects "clicked"—replicating physical exhibition online missing digital medium advantages, linear path through five chronological sections not leveraging nonlinear possibility, minimal interactivity beyond basic click-to-view and play/pause, no personalization or adaptive content, no contribution or social features, essentially digital brochure not immersive experience). Navigation undefined (no wireframes or prototypes testing how visitors move through content, unclear how menus, breadcrumbs, or progress indicators will work, no consideration of search, filtering, or alternative access paths, mobile navigation not thought through though 60-70% visitors likely mobile). Engagement mechanisms minimal (object zoom and audio playback only interactions, no gamification or motivation beyond intrinsic interest, no social sharing or discussion features, no calls to action beyond "explore" and "learn", no surprise or delight moments, essentially passive consumption not active participation). No user testing planned (no budget or timeline allocated for prototype testing with students, teachers, community members, no usability testing before launch risking launching exhibition that confuses or frustrates visitors, no accessibility testing beyond automated tools, plan to "launch and see how it goes" risky approach). Visual design not addressed (no mockups or style guide, assuming WordPress theme "good enough" without customization, inconsistent visual identity across materials—brochure, website, social media using different palettes and typography, no consideration of how design supports narrative mood and emotional arc).

**Strengths:** Curator has clear vision of ideal visitor experience providing strong foundation for designer to execute, oral history content inherently engaging compensating for interaction limitations, small scope enabling iteration and improvement post-launch unlike massive exhibitions difficult to revise.

**Critical Gaps:** No UX/UI design expertise threatening visitor experience quality and engagement—must hire freelancer $15-25K or accept compromised amateur design, traditional gallery metaphor missing digital opportunities—needs design thinking workshops reimagining experience for digital medium, no user testing planned risking launch of confusing or ineffective exhibition—must build testing into timeline and budget, mobile experience not considered despite mobile-first consumption patterns—responsive design essential not optional.

- **Technical Infrastructure & Platform: 2.5/5.0** — Developing capability. Current website WordPress on shared hosting (small marketing site adequate for brochure purposes, shared hosting $15/month from budget provider limiting performance and scalability, no staging environment—all changes made directly to live site risking breaking production, automatic updates disabled after plugin conflict broke site creating security vulnerability, irregular backups by IT coordinator manually downloading—no automated system or geographic redundancy). No exhibition platform selected (evaluated Omeka, Scalar, Exhibit.so during planning but no decision made, considering custom WordPress development using existing platform but questioning if sufficient for interactive features desired, free hosted options like Google Arts & Culture or Artstor Shared Shelf attractive for cost but limited customization and institutional branding, decision paralysis from competing priorities—ease of use for curator, cost constraints, technical capabilities, long-term sustainability). Hosting and performance concerns (current shared hosting insufficient for media-heavy exhibition with 45 audio files and 120+ high-res images, estimating need for VPS or cloud hosting $50-150/month depending on traffic, content delivery network likely necessary for acceptable global performance adding $20-50/month, no load testing or performance benchmarking planned despite 50K visitor goal, no monitoring or alerting if site goes down—IT coordinator checks manually). Security basic (SSL certificate installed enabling HTTPS, WordPress core and plugins updated irregularly—several minor version behind, strong passwords for admin accounts but no two-factor authentication, no WAF or DDoS protection, no security auditing or penetration testing, no incident response plan if compromised, acceptable for low-risk marketing site concerning for exhibition with research value and traffic). No analytics beyond basic (Google Analytics installed tracking visits and pages but no custom event tracking for exhibition-specific interactions, no heatmaps or session recordings understanding how visitors actually engage, no goal tracking or conversion measurement, data not regularly reviewed—install and forget approach, no privacy policy or cookie consent banner for GDPR/CCPA compliance—operating in legal grey area). Database and API absent (flat WordPress pages and posts not structured exhibition data, no API enabling future reuse in mobile app, digital kiosk, or institutional repository, no export or migration path if platform change needed—content trapped in WordPress, no integration with institutional collection management system creating separate data silo).

**Strengths:** WordPress familiarity among staff reducing learning curve, existing hosting relationship simplifying procurement, small scale making sophisticated infrastructure overkill potentially, tight budget forcing prioritization and frugality preventing over-engineering.

**Critical Gaps:** Shared hosting inadequate for media-rich exhibition at target scale—must upgrade to managed WordPress hosting (WP Engine, Kinsta, $30-50/month) or cloud VPS, no exhibition platform selected paralyzing development—must decide immediately between Omeka (structured flexible), custom WordPress (familiar limited), or hosted (easy locked-in) based on capability vs cost tradeoffs, analytics insufficient for measuring impact and iteration—implement event tracking, goals, and regular review rhythm, no staging environment creating risk of breaking live site—critical for safe development and curator preview.

- **Accessibility & Inclusion: 2.7/5.0** — Moderate gaps. WCAG awareness but no compliance verification (curator and IT coordinator aware of web accessibility and legal requirements but no formal training or expertise, assuming WordPress theme accessible without verification through automated or manual testing, no accessibility testing tools installed or used, no disabled user testing, risk of launching non-compliant exhibition creating legal exposure and excluding disabled visitors). Basic accessibility features considered (planning captions on oral history audio and transcripts available given transcription already complete for research purposes, alt text on images with basic descriptions though possibly insufficient detail, keyboard navigation assuming WordPress default themes adequate without specific testing, color contrast not evaluated—using default theme colors without verification against WCAG standards). Advanced accessibility gaps (no audio descriptions for photograph gallery limiting blind visitor comprehension, no plain language option despite vocabulary and sentence complexity potentially excluding some visitors, no dyslexia-friendly formatting options, no captions on any video if added later in development, no sign language interpretation, screen reader compatibility untested—semantic HTML and ARIA possibly missing, no accessibility statement declaring conformance and providing contact for issues). Multilingual aspiration unfunded (recognizing immigrant community audience includes non-English speakers suggesting Spanish, Somali, or other translation priorities, no budget allocated for professional translation—volunteer translation considered but concerns about quality, machine translation possible but awkward and inappropriate for serious historical content, deferring multilingual to "phase 2" after English launch reducing initial reach and community connection). Inclusive design principles understood superficially (curator aware of importance of diverse representation and community voice—exhibition features Black voices authentically not filtered through white institutional interpretation, language choices reviewed with community advisors avoiding dated or offensive terminology, content appropriate for teens and adults—may need adaptation for elementary use, no consideration of cognitive load, visual complexity, or neurodiverse visitors).

**Strengths:** Transcripts completed for oral histories providing deaf/hard-of-hearing access and supporting learning for all visitors, community partnerships ensuring cultural authenticity and appropriate representation building trust with Black visitors, awareness of accessibility importance establishing intention even if execution incomplete.

**Critical Gaps:** No WCAG testing or compliance verification risking legal exposure and excluding disabled visitors—must conduct automated testing with WAVE or Lighthouse and manual keyboard/screen reader testing before launch, no audio descriptions for photograph-heavy content excluding blind visitors from significant exhibition component—can implement progressively starting with most important images, no plain language option potentially excluding cognitive disability, ESL, or younger visitors—consider simplified version of key content, multilingual translation unfunded limiting community reach—prioritize Spanish translation at minimum $5-8K professionally or seek bilingual volunteer with review.

- **Audience Engagement & Impact: 2.8/5.0** — Developing strategy. Marketing plan basic (social media announcements on institutional Facebook (2,400 followers) and Instagram (800 followers) with limited engagement rates 1-2%, email announcement to member list of 1,200 contacts, website homepage feature and blog posts, press release to local media including African American community newspaper and NPR affiliate, educator direct outreach to 30 teachers at partner schools, no paid advertising budget, no influencer or blogger outreach, no content marketing or teaser campaign building anticipation—launch announcement approach not sustained engagement). Community engagement limited by capacity (partnered with three descendant families who contributed materials and reviewed content ensuring authenticity, hosted community listening session with 15 attendees gathering feedback, planning launch event with descendants and community leaders but budget only $1,500 limiting scale, no ongoing community programming—exhibition exists in isolation not integrated into broader engagement strategy, no crowdsourcing or participatory features enabling visitor contribution beyond comments, no social media hashtag campaign or user content solicitation). Educational programming stronger relative to other dimensions (curriculum guide drafted by educator with lesson plans for 8th-12th grade US History aligned to state standards, teacher preview workshop planned for 25 teachers including CEU credit, student activity sheets with source analysis and reflection questions, planning webinar with curator and descendant discussing migration experiences—one-time 45-minute session, no sustained university partnerships or scholarly integration, no certification or deeper learning opportunities). Impact measurement minimal (planning Google Analytics tracking basic visits and pages, post-visit survey using Google Form with 5 questions about satisfaction and learning—hoping for responses but no incentive or systematic collection, no pre/post learning assessment with students, no teacher feedback mechanism beyond workshop evaluation, no citation tracking or scholarly use monitoring, no long-term follow-up assessing sustained impact, essentially launch and hope approach without rigorous evaluation). Sustainability uncertain (no operational funding identified after grant expires—hoping visitor traffic and demonstrated impact will attract ongoing support or justify allocation from operating budget, content refresh and updates dependent on curator volunteer time not dedicated budget, technology maintenance funded for 2 years through grant then uncertain—risk of exhibition becoming abandoned or broken over time, no revenue model or earned income—entirely dependent on grants and institutional support).

**Strengths:** Teacher partnerships and curriculum guide creating strong school adoption pathway likely delivering significant student reach, community partnerships ensuring authentic voice and descendant endorsement building trust and promotion, educator commitment and skill creating quality educational resources, launch event generating initial visibility and media coverage.

**Moderate Gaps:** Marketing strategy basic and underfunded risking low initial visibility—traffic projections optimistic without paid promotion or content marketing, sustainability planning absent threatening long-term viability and waste of $120K investment if exhibition abandoned after 2-3 years, impact measurement insufficient to demonstrate value or attract future funding—need rigorous evaluation documenting educational and social outcomes, no participatory or social features limiting community engagement to passive consumption not active dialogue.

**Critical Observations & Launch Recommendations:**

**Verdict: CONDITIONAL PROCEED** — Exhibition has strong narrative foundation and community partnerships positioning for success, but significant gaps in digital asset readiness, UX design, technical platform, and accessibility threaten launch quality and visitor experience. Recommend 6-month preparation intensive addressing critical gaps before committing to platform development, restructuring timeline and budget to front-load foundational work.

**Critical Blockers Requiring Resolution Before Proceeding:**

1. **Platform Decision Paralysis** (Impact: CRITICAL) — Cannot proceed with development without platform selection defining technical foundation. **Action:** Convene decision-making session within 2 weeks evaluating options against matrix: (1) Omeka S ($0 software, $50/month hosting, steep learning curve, maximum flexibility and structured data), (2) Custom WordPress ($0-5K theme/plugins, $30-50/month hosting, familiar but limited exhibition features), (3) Exhibit.so or similar ($50-200/month SaaS, easiest but locked-in and limited customization), (4) Google Arts & Culture free hosted (free but no customization or institutional branding). **Recommendation:** Omeka S balancing capability, cost, and sustainability—invest 40 hours curator training, hire Omeka consultant $3-5K setup assistance, host on Reclaim Hosting $50/month. Alternative if timeline critical: WordPress with premium exhibition theme $60-200 accepting limitations for faster launch.

2. **UX/UI Design Absence** (Impact: HIGH) — Curator vision strong but lacking digital interaction design expertise translating narrative to compelling user experience. Amateur design risks low engagement and early bounce. **Action:** Hire UX/UI freelancer for 80-120 hours at $75-125/hour ($6-15K) to conduct design workshops, create wireframes and prototypes, design visual identity, and produce design specifications for development. Scope: information architecture, navigation design, interaction patterns, visual design system, responsive layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop, accessibility review. Alternative if budget critical: Use pre-designed Omeka or WordPress theme (limits customization) and allocate 40 hours curator working with IT coordinator adapting using design principles from online courses—acceptable not optimal.

3. **Digitization Completion and Quality** (Impact: HIGH) — 40% assets incomplete blocking full development, artifact photography amateur quality. **Action:** Complete remaining digitization within 3 months: (A) Oral histories: Schedule remaining 18 interviews with digitization vendor $150/hour × 36 hours = $5,400 or negotiate with students for $3,000, (B) Photographs: Scan remaining 42 at current vendor $3/scan = $126, (C) Documents: Scan remaining 18 documents $5/document = $90, (D) Artifacts: Reshoot all 15 with professional photographer $500 day including lighting and editing = $1,500-2,000. Total digitization completion: $8-10K. Must complete before platform development begins (Month 1-3) to avoid building exhibition around incomplete assets.

4. **Rights Documentation Cleanup** (Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH) — 25% photographs and some documents have uncertain rights status creating legal risk and potential need to remove from exhibition post-launch. **Action:** (A) Photograph rights audit: Document permissions for all 120 photographs with signed donor forms or institutional provenance, (B) Orphan works diligent search for 25-30 uncertain photographs using ancestry.com, local genealogists, and historical societies attempting to locate copyright holders or heirs, document search for fair use defense, (C) Legal consultation with intellectual property attorney specializing in archives—1-2 hours ($300-600) reviewing risk assessment and approval for orphan works use in educational context, (D) Rights database in spreadsheet documenting status, permissions, restrictions for each asset. Timeline: Months 1-3 concurrent with digitization. Cost: $1,500-2,500 including genealogy assistance and legal consultation.

5. **Accessibility Testing and Remediation** (Impact: MEDIUM) — No WCAG testing planned risking non-compliant launch excluding disabled visitors and creating legal exposure. **Action:** (A) Automated testing using WAVE, Axe, and Lighthouse on prototype and development site identifying technical violations, (B) Manual keyboard and screen reader testing with IT coordinator or consultant verifying real-world usability, (C) Disabled user testing recruiting 3-5 disabled volunteers testing with JAWS/NVDA, VoiceOver, keyboard only, and providing feedback—stipends $50-100/tester, (D) Remediation addressing identified issues before launch—estimated 20-40 hours development time, (E) Accessibility statement documenting conformance, known issues, and feedback mechanism. Timeline: Months 8-10 during development. Cost: $500-1,000 testing stipends plus development time.
