# Risk Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess an organization's readiness to manage financial and enterprise risk across six dimensions: Governance & Risk Appetite, Risk Identification & Taxonomy, Measurement & Stress Testing, Controls & Mitigation, Monitoring & Reporting, and Culture & Compliance. Identify gaps, prioritize actions, and produce a roadmap tied to measurable outcomes.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **risk management readiness** for **[ORGANIZATION]** managing **[RISK_SCOPE]** under **[REGULATORY_CONTEXT]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Governance & appetite**—are risk appetite, decision rights, and escalation clear and practiced? (2) **Identification & taxonomy**—is there a consistent risk inventory, taxonomy, and ownership across lines of business? (3) **Measurement & stress testing**—are exposures quantified with fit-for-purpose models, scenarios, and data quality controls? (4) **Controls & mitigation**—are key controls designed, tested, and improved; are mitigations cost-effective and tracked? (5) **Monitoring & reporting**—are KRIs/KPIs timely, decision-grade, and linked to actions; is limit management effective? (6) **Culture & compliance**—do teams understand and follow policies; is compliance integrated early; are issues learned from? Provide a 1–5 scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 12-month capability plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for a rapid risk-management readiness evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive risk management readiness assessment for {ORGANIZATION}, a {INDUSTRY} organization operating under {REGULATORY_CONTEXT} managing {RISK_SCOPE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. GOVERNANCE & RISK APPETITE READINESS**
- Board/executive oversight (committees, cadence, decision quality)
- Risk appetite statement (clear, measurable, cascaded to limits and policies)
- Roles and accountability (1st/2nd/3rd line clarity; ownership of risks and controls)
- Escalation and decision latency (how quickly issues reach decision makers)
- Policy framework (coverage, exceptions process, review and approval discipline)
- Resource adequacy (risk function capacity, independence, skills)

**2. RISK IDENTIFICATION & TAXONOMY READINESS**
- Enterprise risk inventory completeness (credit/market/liquidity/operational/compliance)
- Consistent taxonomy and definitions across the organization
- Risk ownership and control mapping (who owns the risk; where controls live)
- New product/change risk assessment integrated into delivery processes
- Third-party and concentration risk coverage
- Issue capture (incidents, losses, near misses, audit findings) consolidated

**3. MEASUREMENT, MODELING & STRESS TESTING READINESS**
- Exposure measurement (limits, sensitivities, VaR/earnings-at-risk where applicable)
- Data quality and lineage (source systems, reconciliations, controls)
- Model governance (validation, approvals, monitoring, documentation)
- Scenario design and stress testing cadence (idiosyncratic + macro)
- Assumption management (explicit, reviewed, sensitivity-tested)
- Capital/liquidity planning linkage (where applicable)

**4. CONTROLS & MITIGATION READINESS**
- Key control identification (prevent/detect; mapped to top risks)
- Control design effectiveness (does it actually reduce risk?)
- Control operation effectiveness (evidence, testing, remediation discipline)
- Limits and guardrails (set, monitored, enforced; exceptions managed)
- Mitigation tracking (hedges, collateral, operational mitigations, insurance)
- Root cause discipline for recurring issues (CAPA-like prevention)

**5. MONITORING, REPORTING & DECISION SUPPORT READINESS**
- KRIs and thresholds (leading indicators, actionable triggers)
- Limit management and exception reporting (timely, clear owners)
- Management reporting quality (accuracy, consistency, narrative, action log)
- Aggregation across portfolios/products/entities (avoid blind spots)
- Event/incident monitoring (operational risk events, compliance breaches)
- Feedback loop (reports lead to decisions and measurable actions)

**6. CULTURE, COMPLIANCE & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
- Risk culture (speak-up, accountability, incentives aligned to risk outcomes)
- Training and policy comprehension (role-based, refreshed, measured)
- Compliance integration (privacy/AML/sanctions/industry regs as relevant)
- Audit and regulatory readiness (evidence, traceability, remediation tracking)
- Lessons learned loop (post-mortems, playbooks, control improvements)
- Change management for risk (communicating changes; adoption verification)

Deliver your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall score, maturity level, top 3 priorities, top risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and key finding per dimension

3. **RISK INVENTORY & APPETITE CHECK** - Key risks, ownership, limits/guardrails, major exposures

4. **GAP ANALYSIS** - Top 5 gaps ranked by impact and urgency, with recommended actions

5. **12-MONTH ROADMAP** - Quarterly actions across governance, measurement, controls, and reporting

6. **SUCCESS METRICS** - Baseline vs 6-month and 12-month targets (KRI coverage, limit breaches, issue aging)

Use this maturity scale:
- 1.0-1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, inconsistent, reactive)
- 2.0-2.9: Developing (basic policies/metrics, gaps in coverage and enforcement)
- 3.0-3.9: Defined (repeatable methods, clear roles, managed exposures)
- 4.0-4.9: Managed (integrated, decision-grade reporting, strong governance)
- 5.0: Optimized (proactive, resilient, continuously improving risk system)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `[ORGANIZATION]` | Name of the organization | "HarborView Bank" |
| `[RISK_SCOPE]` | Risk scope and focus areas | "Credit + operational risk for retail lending" |
| `[REGULATORY_CONTEXT]` | Applicable regulatory/standards context | "Basel-aligned capital, local regulator reporting" |

## Example

**Banking - Retail Lending**

> Assess risk management readiness for **HarborView Bank** managing **credit + operational risk for retail lending** under **Basel-aligned capital, local regulator reporting**. (1) Governance—risk appetite exists but is not cascaded into limits; escalation is slow. (2) Identification—risk inventory is fragmented by product; third-party risk is inconsistently captured. (3) Measurement—credit models exist but data lineage is weak; stress tests are annual and not tied to decisions. (4) Controls—key controls are documented but testing evidence is inconsistent; limit breaches are handled informally. (5) Reporting—KRIs are mostly lagging; reports lack action logs and owners. (6) Culture/compliance—training is checkbox-based; recurring issues repeat across audits. Provide scorecard, top gaps, and a 12-month roadmap focused on appetite-to-limits, model governance, and decision-grade KRIs.
