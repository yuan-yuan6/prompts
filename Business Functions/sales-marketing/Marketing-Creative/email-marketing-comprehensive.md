# Comprehensive Email Marketing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run a full email marketing program spanning lifecycle strategy, segmentation, deliverability, governance, and performance optimization.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess comprehensive email marketing readiness for [BRAND_ORGANIZATION] targeting [TARGET_AUDIENCE] with objectives [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVES]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Lifecycle strategy & segmentation, (2) Content system & personalization, (3) Deliverability & list health, (4) Automation & integrations, (5) Measurement & experimentation, (6) Governance, compliance & operations. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Lifecycle Strategy & Segmentation
- 1 — Initial: Sends are batch-and-blast; lifecycle goals unclear; segments are minimal.
- 3 — Defined: Lifecycle stages mapped; core sequences exist; segmentation rules are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy is data-driven; personalization is controlled; lifecycle programs continuously improve.

### 2) Content System & Personalization
- 1 — Initial: Content is inconsistent; templates missing; personalization is superficial.
- 3 — Defined: Content pillars, templates, and voice rules; personalization uses behavior/attributes.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular content system; experimentation guides creative; personalization improves relevance without increasing risk.

### 3) Deliverability & List Health
- 1 — Initial: Authentication and monitoring are weak; list hygiene inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Authentication configured; hygiene routines; suppression rules; deliverability KPIs tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Proactive deliverability management; fatigue controls; segmentation protects reputation.

### 4) Automation & Integrations
- 1 — Initial: Automation is limited; data is siloed; triggers are unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Key automations and triggers; CRM/CDP integration supports segmentation and reporting.
- 5 — Optimized: Robust automation architecture; reliable event tracking; maintainable workflows with clear ownership.

### 5) Measurement & Experimentation
- 1 — Initial: Metrics focus on opens/clicks; limited attribution; testing is inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework includes downstream outcomes; testing cadence; analysis routines; learnings captured.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program with creative analytics; incrementality awareness; optimization ties to revenue/retention.

### 6) Governance, Compliance & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Consent and preferences are unclear; approvals ad-hoc; errors recur.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance and QA checklists; preference center; roles and approval workflow.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance embedded; audits and documentation; operations are reliable, fast, and scalable.

## Deliverables
- Program readiness scorecard and prioritized gap list
- Lifecycle program map (sequences, triggers, segments)
- Content system (templates, pillars, personalization rules)
- Deliverability runbook (auth, hygiene, monitoring, fatigue controls)
- Measurement/testing framework and learnings repository
- 90-day roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_ORGANIZATION]: Organization sending emails
- [TARGET_AUDIENCE]: Target segment(s)
- [CAMPAIGN_OBJECTIVES]: Acquisition, onboarding, upsell, retention, winback
- [DATA_SOURCES]: CRM, CDP, product analytics, ecommerce platform
- [INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS]: Event tracking and sync cadence
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: Engagement + conversion + retention KPIs

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: B2B SaaS improving lead nurture and onboarding
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Content 2; Deliverability 4; Automation 2; Measurement 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Weak triggers/integration; limited experimentation; inconsistent personalization rules
- 90-day priorities: Improve event tracking + triggers; define modular templates; implement weekly tests tied to conversion and retention
