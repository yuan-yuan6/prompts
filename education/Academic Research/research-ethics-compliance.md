```

## Variables
- `[RESEARCH_DESIGN_TYPE]`: Type of research study
- `[TARGET_POPULATION]`: Participants to be enrolled
- `[DATA_COLLECTION_METHODS]`: How data will be collected
- `[RISK_ASSESSMENT]`: Anticipated risk level
- `[RESEARCH_SETTING]`: Where study will occur
- `[STUDY_DURATION]`: Length of participant involvement
- `[VULNERABLE_GROUPS]`: Any vulnerable populations included

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Minimal Risk Survey Study
"Prepare an IRB application for an anonymous online survey of college students about study habits and academic stress, seeking exempt review status, with clear consent information on the survey landing page and no identifiable data collected."

### Example 2: Interview Study with Vulnerable Population
"Develop comprehensive ethics protocols for qualitative interviews with domestic violence survivors, including trauma-informed consent procedures, enhanced confidentiality protections, referral resources, and culturally responsive recruitment through community partnerships."

### Example 3: Clinical Intervention Trial
"Create full IRB application materials for a randomized controlled trial testing a new behavioral intervention for diabetes management, including detailed informed consent, data safety monitoring plan, adverse event reporting procedures, and risk mitigation strategies."

## Best Practices

1. **Start early** - IRB approval takes weeks to months; plan accordingly
2. **Consult IRB staff** - Seek guidance before submitting
3. **Prioritize participant welfare** - Always put safety and rights first
4. **Use plain language** - Avoid jargon in consent forms
5. **Be thorough** - Incomplete applications delay approval
6. **Train your team** - All personnel need ethics training
7. **Document everything** - Maintain detailed records
8. **Monitor continuously** - Ethics is ongoing, not one-time
9. **Report promptly** - Adverse events and deviations must be reported
10. **Stay current** - Regulations and best practices evolve

## Customization Options

1. **By Risk Level**: Adapt for minimal risk vs. greater than minimal risk studies

2. **By Population**: Modify for children, prisoners, cognitively impaired, or other vulnerable groups

3. **By Setting**: Customize for clinical, educational, community, or international contexts

4. **By Study Type**: Specialize for interventions, surveys, observations, or secondary data analysis

5. **By Regulation**: Align with specific regulatory requirements (FDA, international, etc.)
