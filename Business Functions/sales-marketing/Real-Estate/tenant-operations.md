# Tenant Operations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run tenant operations (leasing, communications, maintenance coordination, billing, and renewals) with reliable processes and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess tenant operations readiness for [PORTFOLIO] with [UNIT_COUNT] units and goal [RENEWAL_TARGET]% renewals. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Tenant lifecycle processes, (2) Communication & service standards, (3) Maintenance coordination, (4) Billing & collections, (5) Systems & data, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Tenant Lifecycle Processes
- 1 — Initial: Move-in/move-out and renewals are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Standard lifecycle workflows; owners and SLAs defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Workflows scale predictably; renewals and retention improve.

### 2) Communication & Service Standards
- 1 — Initial: Tenant communication is reactive; standards unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Service standards and templates; escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Service is consistent and measured; satisfaction improves.

### 3) Maintenance Coordination
- 1 — Initial: Work orders managed manually; delays common.
- 3 — Defined: Work order process; vendor SLAs; tracking and QA.
- 5 — Optimized: Maintenance is optimized; preventative work reduces incidents.

### 4) Billing & Collections
- 1 — Initial: Billing errors and disputes common; collections ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Billing processes and dispute workflow; collections cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Billing is accurate and automated; delinquency declines.

### 5) Systems & Data
- 1 — Initial: Systems fragmented; tenant data unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Property management system supports workflows; data definitions.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted; automation reduces admin; reporting is reliable.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: KPIs inconsistent; issues recur.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined (response time, renewals, delinquency); cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement reduces friction and improves retention.

## Deliverables
- Tenant ops readiness scorecard and gap list
- Lifecycle process maps (move-in, service, renewal)
- Service standards and communication templates
- Maintenance and vendor SLA playbooks
- KPI dashboard and improvement backlog

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PORTFOLIO]: Portfolio/buildings
- [UNIT_COUNT]: Unit count
- [RENEWAL_TARGET]: Renewal target
- [RESPONSE_TIME_TARGET]: Service response target
- [DELINQUENCY_RATE]: Delinquency baseline
- [VENDOR_SET]: Vendor list

## Example (Condensed)
- Portfolio: Multifamily portfolio with high tenant complaints
- Scores (1–5): Lifecycle 3; Service 2; Maintenance 2; Billing 2; Systems 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize service SLAs; implement work order workflow; improve billing QA and KPI cadence
