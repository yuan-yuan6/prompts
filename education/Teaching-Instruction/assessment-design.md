# Assessment Design & Evaluation Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive assessment strategies including test design, rubrics, formative and summative assessments, evaluation methods, and performance measurement systems for educational programs.

## Quick Start

**Need to design an assessment quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Design a unit test for 9th grade world history covering Ancient Rome. Include: 20 multiple-choice questions, 3 short answer questions, and 1 essay question. Align with state standards. Create a scoring rubric for the essay. Test duration: 50 minutes. Mix of recall, comprehension, and analysis questions following Bloom's taxonomy.
```

### When to Use This
- Creating tests, quizzes, and exams
- Developing rubrics and grading criteria
- Designing formative and summative assessments
- Building comprehensive program evaluation systems

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Align to objectives** - Match assessment to learning goals and standards
2. **Design instruments** - Create questions, rubrics, and performance tasks
3. **Validate and refine** - Pilot test and ensure validity and reliability

**Time to complete**: 1-2 hours for simple quizzes, 4-8 hours for comprehensive assessments

## Best Practices

1. **Align with learning objectives** - Ensure all activities support stated goals
2. **Differentiate instruction** - Provide multiple pathways for diverse learners
3. **Use formative assessment** - Check understanding throughout the lesson
4. **Engage students actively** - Incorporate interactive and hands-on elements
5. **Provide clear instructions** - Students should know what's expected
6. **Plan for transitions** - Smooth movement between activities maintains flow
7. **Build in reflection time** - Allow students to process and synthesize learning
8. **Connect to prior knowledge** - Activate existing schemas before introducing new content
