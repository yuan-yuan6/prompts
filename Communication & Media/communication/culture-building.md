# Culture Building & Employee Engagement Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build a **strong, aligned, and engaging organizational culture** that attracts talent, drives performance, and retains employees. Use this to diagnose gaps in values clarity, recognition practices, and engagement mechanisms.

## Template

Conduct a culture building & employee engagement readiness assessment for {CULTURE_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (engagement scores, turnover, values demonstration, recognition frequency).

**1) VALUES CLARITY & ALIGNMENT**
- Core values are defined, memorable, and translated into observable behaviors
- Values guide decisions (hiring, performance, promotions, resource allocation)
- Leaders model values consistently and visibly
- Employees can articulate values and see them in action daily

**2) RECOGNITION & APPRECIATION**
- Recognition is frequent, specific, and tied to values and outcomes
- Peer-to-peer and manager-to-employee recognition mechanisms exist
- Milestones and achievements are celebrated publicly and meaningfully
- Recognition is inclusive and equitable across roles and levels

**3) COMMUNICATION & TRANSPARENCY**
- Leadership communicates vision, strategy, and challenges openly
- Two-way feedback channels exist and are used (town halls, surveys, skip-levels)
- Information flows freely across levels and functions (no silos)
- Employees feel heard and see their input lead to action

**4) RITUALS, TRADITIONS & BELONGING**
- Rituals reinforce culture (team meetings, celebrations, onboarding, offsites)
- Traditions build identity and connection (anniversary celebrations, storytelling)
- New employees are onboarded into culture intentionally
- Social connection opportunities exist across teams and locations

**5) DEVELOPMENT & GROWTH MINDSET**
- Learning and skill development are prioritized and resourced
- Failure is treated as learning (not punished); experimentation is encouraged
- Career paths and growth opportunities are visible and accessible
- Mentorship and coaching are embedded in management practice

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Engagement is measured regularly (surveys, pulse checks, exit interviews)
- Culture metrics are tracked (turnover, eNPS, values demonstration)
- Feedback drives action plans with owners and timelines
- Culture initiatives are evaluated for impact and iterated

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, engagement/retention risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **ENGAGEMENT SNAPSHOT**
- Current engagement score, turnover rate, eNPS, and benchmarks
- Top drivers of engagement and disengagement (from survey/exit data)

4) **VALUES & RECOGNITION AUDIT**
- Values clarity and demonstration assessment
- Recognition frequency, types, and equity analysis

5) **CULTURE RITUAL INVENTORY**
- Existing rituals and their effectiveness
- Gaps in connection, celebration, and onboarding

6) **30/60/90-DAY CULTURE STRENGTHENING PLAN**
- Actions to improve values alignment, recognition, and engagement
- Metrics (engagement score, turnover, eNPS, recognition frequency)

---

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (unclear values, low engagement, high turnover, reactive)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic efforts exist, gaps in consistency and measurement)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, values clear, rituals established)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high engagement, measured culture, continuous improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, strong retention, culture as competitive advantage)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {CULTURE_CONTEXT}: Org size, current engagement/turnover, values status, culture challenges
- {OBJECTIVES}: Engagement, retention, values demonstration, and performance goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Budget, leadership capacity, geographic spread, competing priorities

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {CULTURE_CONTEXT}: 350-person fintech startup (Series B). Hybrid work (3 offices + 30% remote). Current engagement: 68% (industry avg 75%), turnover 22%/year (goal 12%), eNPS +18. Values exist on paper but inconsistently practiced. Recent feedback: "leadership not transparent," "no recognition culture."
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase engagement to 78%, reduce turnover to 12%, improve eNPS to +35, embed values in daily operations.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $50K culture budget; no dedicated culture team; leadership stretched with growth priorities; geographic spread limits in-person connection.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.4 (Developing)
- Key risks: 22% turnover driven by lack of recognition and leadership transparency; values not consistently modeled
- Top improvements: (1) launch peer recognition program, (2) establish monthly leadership Q&A, (3) define values-aligned behaviors

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Values Clarity & Alignment: 2/5 — values stated but behaviors undefined; not used in decisions
- Recognition & Appreciation: 2/5 — ad hoc manager recognition; no peer-to-peer; promotions only celebration
- Communication & Transparency: 2/5 — quarterly all-hands but limited dialogue; feedback not acted on
- Rituals, Traditions & Belonging: 3/5 — onboarding exists; team rituals inconsistent; remote employees isolated
- Development & Growth: 3/5 — training budget exists; career paths unclear; mentorship informal
- Measurement & Improvement: 3/5 — annual survey conducted; exit interviews not analyzed; no pulse checks

**3) ENGAGEMENT SNAPSHOT**
- Engagement score: 68% (goal 78%, industry 75%)
- Turnover: 22% annualized (goal 12%, industry 18%)
- eNPS: +18 (goal +35, industry +28)
- Top engagement drivers (from survey): product mission, team collaboration, compensation
- Top disengagement drivers: lack of recognition (65% cited), leadership transparency (58%), unclear career paths (52%)

**4) VALUES & RECOGNITION AUDIT**
- Values: Innovation, Customer Obsession, Ownership, Transparency (stated)
- Values clarity: 40% of employees can name all 4; behaviors not documented
- Values in action: promotions not tied to values; exit interviews show "Transparency" not practiced
- Recognition frequency: avg 1x/quarter per employee (goal 2x/month)
- Recognition types: 90% manager-initiated, 10% peer; mostly verbal, rarely public
- Equity analysis: engineering receives 60% of recognition; support teams underrecognized

**5) CULTURE RITUAL INVENTORY**
- Existing rituals:
  - Weekly team standups (effective, 85% participation)
  - Monthly birthday celebrations (effective, builds connection)
  - Quarterly all-hands (needs improvement, one-way, limited Q&A)
  - Annual offsite (effective but infrequent)
- Gaps:
  - No onboarding ritual for culture immersion (values, stories, traditions)
  - No regular celebration of customer wins or product launches
  - Remote employees excluded from in-office rituals (happy hours, lunches)
  - No tradition for work anniversaries or milestone recognition

**6) 30/60/90-DAY CULTURE STRENGTHENING PLAN**
- 30 days: launch peer recognition Slack channel + weekly "values in action" spotlight; define observable behaviors for each value (e.g., "Ownership" = owns outcomes, no blame, proposes solutions)
- 60 days: establish monthly leadership Q&A (live + recorded); analyze exit interview themes; create career path framework for top 3 roles
- 90 days: pilot quarterly pulse survey; launch mentorship program (20 pairs); create remote inclusion rituals (virtual coffee, async celebrations)
- Metrics: engagement (goal 72% by 90 days), eNPS (goal +25), recognition frequency (goal 1x/month), turnover (goal 18%)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Define values as observable behaviors, not aspirational statements—make them actionable.
2) Recognize frequently and specifically: tie recognition to values and impact, not just outcomes.
3) Enable peer-to-peer recognition to build horizontal culture, not just top-down.
4) Communicate transparently: share wins, challenges, and strategic context regularly.
5) Create consistent rituals that build identity (weekly check-ins, milestone celebrations, storytelling).
6) Measure engagement quarterly with pulse checks; act on feedback within 30 days.
7) Onboard new hires into culture explicitly: values, stories, rituals, and expectations.
8) Model culture from the top: leaders must demonstrate values visibly and consistently.
