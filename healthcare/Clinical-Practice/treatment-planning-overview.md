# Treatment Planning Overview

## Purpose
Navigate to the appropriate treatment planning template based on clinical context, patient needs, and care setting. Each specialized template provides focused, actionable guidance for specific treatment scenarios.

## Quick Start

**Want to create a clinical treatment plan?** Here's how to choose the right template:

### When to Use This Overview
- Developing patient-specific treatment plans
- Determining which clinical approach to use
- Creating care plans for new diagnoses
- Transitioning patients between care settings
- Unsure which treatment template fits your scenario

### Quick Template Selection
```
Your Clinical Scenario → Recommended Template:

1. Emergency or urgent care
   → acute-care-treatment-plan.md (ABCs, rapid stabilization, 15-30 min)

2. Long-term condition management (diabetes, COPD, hypertension)
   → chronic-disease-management-plan.md (Ongoing care, lifestyle, monitoring, 30-45 min)

3. Planning surgical procedures
   → surgical-treatment-plan.md (Pre-op, intra-op, post-op care, 30-60 min)

4. Mental health and psychiatric care
   → mental-health-treatment-plan.md (Therapy, medications, support, 45-60 min)
```

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Identify care type** - Determine if acute, chronic, surgical, or mental health treatment needed
2. **Select template** - Choose the specialized template that matches your clinical context
3. **Customize for patient** - Adapt the template to patient-specific factors and preferences

**Time to complete**: 15-60 minutes depending on complexity

**Pro tip**: For patients with multiple conditions, start with the primary/acute issue template, then incorporate chronic disease management strategies as needed.

## Choosing the Right Template

### Clinical Context Decision Guide

**Ask yourself:**

1. **What is the timeframe?**
   - Hours to 1 day → **Acute Care**
   - Days to weeks (surgical episode) → **Surgical**
   - Weeks to months → **Mental Health**
   - Months to years → **Chronic Disease**

2. **What is the primary intervention?**
   - Emergency stabilization → **Acute Care**
   - Surgical procedure → **Surgical**
   - Psychiatric/psychological → **Mental Health**
   - Ongoing medical management → **Chronic Disease**

3. **What is the care setting?**
   - Emergency Department/ICU → **Acute Care**
   - Operating room/perioperative → **Surgical**
   - Mental health clinic/behavioral health → **Mental Health**
   - Primary care/specialty clinic → **Chronic Disease**

4. **What is the urgency?**
   - Life-threatening/critical → **Acute Care**
   - Scheduled surgical intervention → **Surgical**
   - Ongoing management → **Chronic Disease** or **Mental Health**

### Example: Surgical Patient with Depression
1. **Mental Health Template** - Optimize depression before surgery
2. **Surgical Template** - Perioperative planning for hip replacement
3. **Chronic Disease Template** - Manage osteoarthritis long-term
4. **Mental Health Template** - Continue depression management

### Example: Chronic Disease with Acute Exacerbation
1. **Chronic Disease Template** - Baseline COPD management
2. **Acute Care Template** - COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization

## Getting Started

1. **Identify the clinical context** using the decision guide above
2. **Select the appropriate template** based on timeframe and intervention type
3. **Review the template structure** to understand all sections
4. **Customize variables** for your specific patient and setting
5. **Follow best practices** outlined in each template
6. **Document the plan** clearly in the medical record
7. **Communicate the plan** to patient and care team
8. **Monitor and adjust** based on patient response

## Questions?

When in doubt:
- Consider the **primary care goal** (stabilize vs. manage vs. cure)
- Think about the **timeline** (hours vs. days vs. months)
- Identify the **main intervention** (emergency vs. surgery vs. medication vs. therapy)
- Choose the template that best fits the **dominant clinical context**
- Use **multiple templates** if the patient journey spans different phases

**Note:** These templates are designed to be complementary. Complex patients often require integration of multiple treatment planning approaches to address all their care needs comprehensively.
