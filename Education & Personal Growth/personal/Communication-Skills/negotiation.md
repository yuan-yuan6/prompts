# Negotiation Template

## Purpose
Develop effective negotiation strategies, tactics, and communication approaches to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes in business deals, salary discussions, conflicts, and personal situations.

## Quick Start

Prepare for your next negotiation with this essential checklist:

1. Know your numbers: Write down your ideal outcome, acceptable outcome, and walk-away point before you start
2. Research the market: What are similar deals/salaries/agreements going for? Data is your best friend
3. Understand their perspective: What does the other party really need? (Hint: It's not always money)
4. Start with rapport: Spend the first few minutes building connection—people negotiate better with people they like
5. Practice your opening: Say it out loud. "Based on my research and the value I bring, I'm looking for X" sounds confident and professional

Key mindset shift: Negotiation isn't about winning or losing—it's about finding a solution that works for both parties. When both sides feel good about the outcome, you've truly succeeded.
