# Loyalty Program Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and operate a loyalty program that drives retention and lifetime value with clear economics, reliable data, and measurable impact.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess loyalty program readiness for [BUSINESS] with current retention [RETENTION_RATE]% and goal [LTV_TARGET]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Value proposition & economics, (2) Program design & mechanics, (3) Data & identity, (4) Operations & fulfillment, (5) Governance & compliance, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Value Proposition & Economics
- 1 — Initial: Value proposition unclear; program economics unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Clear member value; cost model and breakage assumptions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Economics are optimized; value and cost are balanced by segment.

### 2) Program Design & Mechanics
- 1 — Initial: Rules are confusing; benefits inconsistent; tiering lacks rationale.
- 3 — Defined: Clear rules, tiers, and earning/burning mechanics; exclusions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Design is tuned by performance; personalization improves engagement.

### 3) Data & Identity
- 1 — Initial: Member identity fragmented; limited customer view.
- 3 — Defined: Single member profile; enrollment and events tracked reliably.
- 5 — Optimized: Data supports personalization and lifecycle orchestration at scale.

### 4) Operations & Fulfillment
- 1 — Initial: Operational processes unclear; redemptions create support load.
- 3 — Defined: Standard workflows for enrollment, points, and redemptions; QA.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations scale with automation; exceptions are managed predictably.

### 5) Governance & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; terms and compliance are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights, terms, and policies; privacy and fraud controls.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; compliance risk is monitored and managed.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: No clear KPIs; impact not evaluated.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined (retention, frequency, LTV); reporting cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization improves outcomes; incrementality and cohort analysis mature.

## Deliverables
- Loyalty readiness scorecard and gap list
- Program value proposition and economics model
- Program rules and tier/benefit structure
- Data and operational workflow map
- Measurement framework and optimization cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [RETENTION_RATE]: Current retention rate
- [LTV_TARGET]: LTV target
- [REWARD_TYPES]: Points, perks, tiers, cash-back
- [COST_PER_POINT]: Cost model inputs
- [FRAUD_RATE]: Fraud/breakage assumptions

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Retail brand launching first loyalty program
- Scores (1–5): Economics 2; Design 2; Data 2; Ops 2; Governance 3; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define economics + rules; implement identity tracking; set KPI cadence and cohort reporting
