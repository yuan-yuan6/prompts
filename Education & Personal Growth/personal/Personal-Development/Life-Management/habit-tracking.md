# Habit Tracking Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and sustain a habit-tracking system that drives behavior change across six dimensions. Use this to identify gaps, optimize your approach, and build a tracking routine that sticks.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess habit-tracking readiness for **{HABIT_CONTEXT}** to establish **{TARGET_HABITS}** with **{TRACKING_APPROACH}**.
>
> Score readiness 1–5 across six dimensions. Provide a scorecard, gap analysis, actionable recommendations, and a 30-day kickstart plan with evidence of early wins.

---

## Readiness Dimensions (Score 1–5)

### 1) Habit Clarity & Design
- Habits are specific and observable (not vague goals)
- Cue-routine-reward loops identified
- Habits sized appropriately (tiny habits vs big routines)

### 2) Tracking Method & Tools
- Tracking approach fits habits and lifestyle (app/paper/hybrid)
- Measurement is simple and sustainable (not burdensome)
- Data capture is immediate or near-immediate (low friction)

### 3) Feedback & Visibility
- Progress is visible (streaks, charts, dashboards)
- Feedback is timely (daily/weekly review)
- Quality assessment beyond binary yes/no (0-10 ratings, notes)

### 4) Motivation & Accountability
- Intrinsic motivation is clear (why it matters)
- External accountability exists (partner, group, public commitment)
- Rewards and celebrations planned (milestones, non-food treats)

### 5) Obstacle Management
- Common failure modes identified (busy days, travel, illness)
- Recovery plan exists (how to restart after a miss)
- Flexibility built in (minimum viable habit for tough days)

### 6) Sustainability & Iteration
- Review cadence defined (weekly reflection, monthly tuning)
- System is low-maintenance (not requiring heroic effort)
- Learning loop for continuous improvement (what works, what doesn't)

## Required Output Format

1) **Executive Summary**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Current maturity level (1–5)
- Top 3 recommendations

2) **Dimension Scorecard**
- Table: Dimension | Score (1–5) | Evidence | Key gap

3) **Habit Snapshot**
- List of habits (2–5 max to start)
- Cue, routine, reward for each
- Tracking method per habit

4) **Gap Analysis (Top 5)**
- Rank gaps by impact × ease-to-fix
- Quick wins first

5) **30-Day Kickstart Plan**
- Week 1: establish tracking routine (focus on consistency, not perfection)
- Week 2: add quality ratings and notes
- Week 3: review patterns; adjust cues/rewards
- Week 4: celebrate wins; plan next 30 days

6) **Success Metrics**
- Baseline → 7-day → 30-day targets (completion %, streak, quality)

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Ad hoc:** No system; sporadic tracking; motivation-dependent.
- **2 — Emerging:** Basic tracking; inconsistent; weak feedback loops.
- **3 — Defined:** Clear habits; daily tracking; visible progress; some accountability.
- **4 — Managed:** Sustained tracking; patterns analyzed; resilient to setbacks.
- **5 — Optimized:** Automatic behavior; system refined continuously; habits deeply ingrained.

## Variables

| Variable | What to provide | Example |
|---|---|---|
| {HABIT_CONTEXT} | Who + constraints | "Individual; busy schedule; past failures with tracking" |
| {TARGET_HABITS} | Habits to build | "Exercise 3x/week, 10 min meditation daily, no phone in bed" |
| {TRACKING_APPROACH} | Preferred method | "Phone app + paper journal" |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {HABIT_CONTEXT}: "Individual: working parent; tried habit apps before but abandoned after 2 weeks; needs simple system"
- {TARGET_HABITS}: "Morning walk 15 min, evening reading 20 min, gratitude journaling"
- {TRACKING_APPROACH}: "Simple app for streaks + weekly paper reflection"

**Output (abridged)**
- Overall readiness: 2.7/5 (Emerging)
- Top recommendations: start with ONE habit; add cue reminders; schedule weekly review

Scorecard highlights
- Habit Clarity & Design: 3 — Habits clear; need smaller versions for busy days
- Tracking Method & Tools: 3 — App chosen; needs setup and reminders
- Feedback & Visibility: 2 — No streak visibility yet; need dashboard
- Motivation & Accountability: 2 — Why is weak; no accountability partner
- Obstacle Management: 2 — No recovery plan; past failures not analyzed
- Sustainability & Iteration: 3 — Weekly review planned; needs metrics

30-Day Kickstart
- Week 1: Track ONE habit (morning walk); focus on showing up, not perfection
- Week 2: Add simple quality rating (1-5); note mood before/after
- Week 3: Review: what cues worked? What rewards felt good? Adjust.
- Week 4: Add 2nd habit if first is solid; celebrate 7-day streak

## Best Practices (8)
1. Start with 1–2 habits max; add more only after 30+ days of consistency.
2. Make tracking stupidly simple (one tap, one checkbox).
3. Track immediately after doing the habit (not at end of day).
4. Use visible progress (streaks, charts) as intrinsic reward.
5. Plan for failure: define your "miss once, not twice" recovery rule.
6. Shrink the habit for tough days (1 pushup, 1 page, 1 minute).
7. Review weekly: what patterns emerge? What needs tweaking?
8. Celebrate small wins publicly (share streaks with a friend).
