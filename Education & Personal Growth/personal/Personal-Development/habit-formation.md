title: Habit Formation Readiness Assessment
use_cases:
- Building lasting habits through cue-routine-reward loops, environmental engineering, and 2-minute starter versions that scale to full behaviors over 66-day cycles
- Breaking bad habits by increasing friction, replacing with positive alternatives, and managing relapse through recovery protocols
- Designing morning/evening routines through habit stacking, keystone habit identification, and progressive implementation phases

# Habit Formation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build a sustainable habit by clarifying motivation, designing cues and routines, and creating a feedback system that supports consistency.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess readiness to build habit [HABIT] with frequency [FREQUENCY]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goal clarity, (2) Cue/routine design, (3) Environment & friction, (4) Tracking & feedback, (5) Resilience & relapse plan, (6) Support & accountability. Provide a scorecard and a 30-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goal Clarity
- 1 — Initial: Habit vague; motivation unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Habit defined with frequency and success criteria.
- 5 — Optimized: Goals are aligned to identity and long-term outcomes.

### 2) Cue/Routine Design
- 1 — Initial: No clear trigger; routine inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Clear cue and routine; implementation intention written.
- 5 — Optimized: Cue/routine is reliable; behavior is automatic in common contexts.

### 3) Environment & Friction
- 1 — Initial: Environment works against the habit.
- 3 — Defined: Friction reduced; materials prepared; obstacles identified.
- 5 — Optimized: Environment strongly supports the habit; defaults favor success.

### 4) Tracking & Feedback
- 1 — Initial: No tracking; progress unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Simple tracking and review cadence established.
- 5 — Optimized: Feedback loops are strong; adjustments are data-informed.

### 5) Resilience & Relapse Plan
- 1 — Initial: Relapse leads to quitting; no plan.
- 3 — Defined: Relapse triggers and recovery plan documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Resilience is high; setbacks are handled quickly and constructively.

### 6) Support & Accountability
- 1 — Initial: No support; accountability absent.
- 3 — Defined: Accountability mechanism and support identified.
- 5 — Optimized: Support system is consistent and helps sustain progress.

## Deliverables
- Habit readiness scorecard and barrier list
- Cue/routine plan and environment setup checklist
- Tracking method and weekly review template
- Relapse recovery plan
- 30-day habit plan with milestones

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [HABIT]: Habit
- [FREQUENCY]: Frequency
- [CUE]: Cue/trigger
- [ROUTINE]: Routine
- [REWARD]: Reward/benefit
- [TRACKING]: Tracking method

## Example (Condensed)
- Habit: Walk 20 minutes, 5x/week
- Scores (1–5): Goal 3; Cue 2; Environment 3; Tracking 2; Resilience 2; Accountability 2
- 30-day priorities: Set a daily cue; reduce friction; start simple tracking; define a relapse plan and accountability check-in
