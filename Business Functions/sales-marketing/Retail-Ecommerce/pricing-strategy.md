# Pricing Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to define and govern pricing strategy across products, channels, and segments with clear objectives, data, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess pricing strategy readiness for [BUSINESS] with [PRODUCT_LINES] and channels [CHANNELS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Pricing objectives & positioning, (2) Segmentation & willingness-to-pay, (3) Data & competitive intelligence, (4) Pricing architecture & rules, (5) Governance & change management, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objectives & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: Pricing goals unclear; inconsistent price decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Clear objectives (margin, share, perception); positioning documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Pricing decisions align to strategy; tradeoffs are explicit and repeatable.

### 2) Segmentation & Willingness-to-Pay
- 1 — Initial: One-size-fits-all pricing; limited understanding of segments.
- 3 — Defined: Segments defined; price sensitivity assumptions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Segmentation is validated; pricing is tuned by segment and channel.

### 3) Data & Competitive Intelligence
- 1 — Initial: Limited price/competitor data; decisions are anecdotal.
- 3 — Defined: Data sources identified; competitor monitoring; sales/elasticity inputs.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is reliable and timely; insights directly inform pricing actions.

### 4) Architecture & Rules
- 1 — Initial: Discounting is uncontrolled; guardrails missing.
- 3 — Defined: Price lists, promos, and discount rules; guardrails documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Rules optimize profitability and customer trust; exceptions are managed.

### 5) Governance & Change Management
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; frequent ad-hoc changes.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights, approvals, and rollout process defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; changes are auditable and low-risk.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Impact of pricing changes not measured consistently.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs defined (margin, conversion, AOV); reporting cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization loop improves outcomes; experiments validate changes.

## Deliverables
- Pricing readiness scorecard and prioritized gaps
- Pricing objectives and segmentation assumptions
- Pricing architecture (price lists, promos, discount guardrails)
- Governance and change rollout plan
- Measurement framework and optimization cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [PRODUCT_LINES]: Product categories/lines
- [CHANNELS]: DTC, retail, marketplace
- [MARGIN_TARGET]: Margin target
- [DISCOUNT_RATE]: Discount rate baseline
- [COMPETITOR_SET]: Competitor list

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Retailer with uncontrolled discounting and margin pressure
- Scores (1–5): Objectives 2; Segmentation 2; Data 2; Rules 3; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Set objectives and guardrails; build competitor monitoring; implement change governance and KPI cadence
