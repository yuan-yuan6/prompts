# Renewable Energy Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to define and execute a renewable energy strategy across portfolio planning, financing, operations, and risk.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess renewable strategy readiness for organization [ORG]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goals & policy context, (2) Portfolio & site selection, (3) Financing & contracting, (4) Grid integration & operations, (5) Risk & compliance, (6) Governance & execution. Provide a scorecard and roadmap.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goals & Policy Context
- 1 — Initial: Goals unclear; policy context not tracked.
- 3 — Defined: Goals and constraints defined; policy assumptions documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Goals are actionable; policy changes are monitored and managed.

### 2) Portfolio & Site Selection
- 1 — Initial: Site selection ad-hoc; constraints unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Portfolio approach and site criteria defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Selection is optimized with data-driven tradeoffs and validation.

### 3) Financing & Contracting
- 1 — Initial: Financing unclear; contracting reactive.
- 3 — Defined: Financing options and contracting templates defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Financing/contracting is optimized; risks priced and managed.

### 4) Grid Integration & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Interconnection risks high; ops unplanned.
- 3 — Defined: Integration plan; operational model defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Integration and operations are mature with monitoring and controls.

### 5) Risk & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: Risks not mapped; compliance uncertain.
- 3 — Defined: Risk register and compliance plan exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Risk management is mature; audits and controls are reliable.

### 6) Governance & Execution
- 1 — Initial: No owners; strategy not executed.
- 3 — Defined: Owners, cadence, and roadmap defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is disciplined; progress tracked and adjusted continuously.

## Deliverables
- Strategy readiness scorecard and gap list
- Renewables portfolio roadmap
- Financing/contracting approach and templates
- Grid integration and operations plan
- Risk register and governance cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORG]: Organization
- [GOALS]: Goals
- [PORTFOLIO]: Portfolio
- [FINANCING]: Financing
- [GRID]: Grid constraints
- [RISKS]: Risks

## Example (Condensed)
- Org: Utility planning 5-year renewables expansion
- Scores (1–5): Goals 3; Portfolio 2; Financing 2; Ops 2; Risk 3; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Define site criteria; standardize contracting; plan integration; set governance cadence
