## Best Practices

1. **Define inclusion/exclusion criteria precisely** - Clear criteria prevent sampling errors and improve study validity
2. **Calculate sample size with conservative assumptions** - Account for attrition, missing data, and design effects
3. **Pilot test all instruments** - Identify problems before full-scale data collection begins
4. **Train data collectors thoroughly** - Standardization requires comprehensive training and ongoing supervision
5. **Build rapport with participants** - Strong relationships improve response rates and data quality
6. **Use multiple recruitment channels** - Diversify approaches to reach target population effectively
7. **Monitor recruitment progress continuously** - Track against milestones and adjust strategies as needed
8. **Implement quality control throughout** - Regular checks prevent problems from accumulating
9. **Protect participant privacy rigorously** - Security measures must be built into all procedures
10. **Document everything systematically** - Detailed documentation enables reproducibility and troubleshooting

## Tips for Success

- Start recruitment earlier than you think necessary - it almost always takes longer than expected
- Build strong relationships with gatekeepers and community partners for access
- Offer flexible participation options to accommodate diverse schedules and preferences
- Create user-friendly instruments that respect participant time and cognitive load
- Use technology strategically where it improves quality or efficiency, not just for novelty
- Maintain detailed tracking systems for recruitment, consent, and data collection progress
- Prepare backup plans for equipment failure, participant dropout, and access issues
- Consider participant burden when designing multi-wave or intensive data collection
- Compensate participants fairly for their time and contribution
- Build in quality checks at multiple stages rather than waiting until analysis

## Customization Options

1. **Population Specificity**: Adapt sampling strategies for hard-to-reach populations, vulnerable groups, elite participants, or international samples with appropriate recruitment and engagement approaches

2. **Data Modality Emphasis**: Customize for primarily quantitative (surveys, tests, physiological measures), qualitative (interviews, observations, documents), or integrated mixed-methods data collection

3. **Technology Integration Level**: Scale from traditional paper-and-pencil methods to fully digital platforms, mobile apps, wearable sensors, or AI-enhanced data collection depending on resources and participant characteristics

4. **Setting Adaptation**: Modify protocols for laboratory-based, field-based, clinical, educational, organizational, or virtual/remote research settings with appropriate procedures

5. **Cultural Contextualization**: Adapt recruitment materials, informed consent processes, and data collection procedures for diverse cultural contexts, languages, and community norms with appropriate sensitivity and responsiveness
