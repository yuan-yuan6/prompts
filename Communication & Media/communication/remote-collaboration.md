# Remote Collaboration & Distributed Team Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to enable **effective remote collaboration** that maintains productivity, fosters connection, and manages complexity across distance and time zones. Use this to diagnose gaps in tools, workflows, communication norms, and team culture.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **remote collaboration readiness** for {REMOTE_CONTEXT}. The remote work objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a remote collaboration & distributed team readiness assessment for {REMOTE_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (productivity, engagement, communication effectiveness, tool adoption, team cohesion).

**1) TOOLS & TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE**
- Collaboration tools are integrated and adopted (not disconnected silos)
- Video, chat, docs, and project tools work seamlessly
- Remote access is reliable and secure (VPN, cloud, mobile)
- Technical support is responsive and distributed-team-aware

**2) ASYNCHRONOUS WORKFLOWS & DOCUMENTATION**
- Async work is default (not synchronous bottlenecks)
- Decisions, context, and knowledge are documented (not in heads or Zoom recordings)
- Handoffs across time zones are smooth (clear ownership, no blocking)
- Status updates are written and searchable (not buried in meetings)

**3) COMMUNICATION NORMS & RESPONSIVENESS**
- Response time expectations are clear by channel (urgent vs. async)
- Overcommunication is valued (context, updates, transparency)
- Meeting norms exist (cameras on, agendas, recordings, time-zone-friendly)
- Digital body language is understood (no assumption of tone)

**4) TEAM CONNECTION & PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY**
- Intentional social connection happens regularly (not just work)
- Remote employees feel included and heard (not second-class)
- Trust is high (no micromanagement or surveillance culture)
- Serendipity is designed (virtual water cooler, informal channels)

**5) MANAGER CAPABILITY & REMOTE LEADERSHIP**
- Managers are trained on remote management (not just office skills)
- Output-focused (not presence-focused) performance management
- 1-on-1s are frequent and meaningful (not skipped or rushed)
- Coaching and feedback are effective remotely

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Productivity and outcomes are tracked (not hours or activity)
- Engagement and connection are measured (surveys, retention, sentiment)
- Remote-specific challenges are identified and addressed
- Best practices are shared and scaled

---

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, remote work risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **TOOL & WORKFLOW AUDIT**
- Tool adoption, integration, and satisfaction
- Async workflow effectiveness and documentation quality

4) **COMMUNICATION & CONNECTION ANALYSIS**
- Response times, meeting effectiveness, social connection frequency
- Inclusion perception, trust scores, and isolation indicators

5) **MANAGER CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (office mindset, poor tools, low engagement, isolation)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic tools, inconsistent practices, mixed effectiveness)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid infrastructure, async workflows, intentional connection)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high productivity, strong engagement, seamless collaboration)
- 5.0: Optimized (remote-first excellence, industry-leading practices, thriving culture)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {REMOTE_CONTEXT}: Org size, remote/hybrid mix, time zones, current remote maturity
- {OBJECTIVES}: Productivity, engagement, retention, and collaboration effectiveness goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Tool budget, manager capacity, time zone spread, cultural norms

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {REMOTE_CONTEXT}: 300-person software company. Fully remote (no office) since 2020. 12 time zones (US, Europe, Asia). Current engagement: 68% (goal 80%, down from 75% pre-pandemic). Productivity self-reported as "same or better" by 70%, but concerns about burnout (avg 50 hrs/week), silos (teams don't collaborate across geo), and new hire onboarding (6 months to full productivity, goal 3). Tools: Slack, Zoom, GitHub, Notion, Linear.
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase engagement to 80%, reduce burnout (goal <45 hrs/week), improve cross-geo collaboration (goal 60% "collaborate effectively across teams"), accelerate onboarding (goal 3 months).
- {CONSTRAINTS}: No office (can't "just meet in person"); 12 time zones (no universal sync time); tool fatigue (resistance to adding more tools); managers promoted from IC (limited management training).

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 3.1 (Defined)
- Key risks: engagement declining, burnout rising, silos forming, onboarding slow
- Top improvements: (1) establish async-first workflows, (2) design intentional connection rituals, (3) train managers on remote leadership

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Tools & Technology: 4/5 — solid stack, well-integrated, reliable; some complaints about Slack overload
- Async Workflows & Documentation: 2/5 — meetings dominate; decisions not documented; knowledge in Slack threads (not findable)
- Communication Norms: 3/5 — some norms exist (response times unclear); meeting overload; cameras often off
- Team Connection & Safety: 3/5 — quarterly offsites strong; daily connection weak; remote employees feel included but lonely
- Manager Capability: 2/5 — managers promoted from IC with no training; presence-focused (online hours); 1-on-1s sporadic
- Measurement & Improvement: 3/5 — engagement survey twice/year; productivity not measured; no remote-specific KPIs

**3) TOOL & WORKFLOW AUDIT**
- Tool adoption:
  - Slack: 98% daily active, but "overwhelming" (avg 200 messages/day/person)
  - Zoom: 95% weekly usage, but "too many meetings" (avg 20 hrs/week in meetings)
  - GitHub: 90% daily (engineers), not used by non-tech roles
  - Notion: 75% adoption (knowledge base), but "hard to find things" (search poor, structure unclear)
  - Linear: 85% adoption (product/eng), not used by other teams (silos)
- Tool integration: strong (Slack + Zoom, GitHub + Linear, Notion accessible from Slack)
- Satisfaction: 7.2/10 avg (Slack and Zoom highest, Notion lowest)
- Async workflow effectiveness:

  - Status updates: 50% async (written standups, Linear updates), 50% in meetings (inefficient)
  - Knowledge sharing: 40% in Notion, 60% tribal (Slack, Zoom, heads)
  - Handoffs: poor across time zones (work blocked waiting for responses, avg 12-hour delay)
- Documentation quality: 4/10 avg
  - What's documented: engineering (code, APIs, architecture), product (specs, roadmaps)

  - Medium skill (5–8/10): 55% of managers (functional but gaps in async, feedback, connection)
  - Low skill (<5/10): 30% of managers (presence-focused, poor communication, skip 1-on-1s)
- Performance management approach:
  - Output-focused: 40% of managers (measure outcomes, not hours)
  - Presence-focused: 60% of managers (monitor online hours, Slack responsiveness, "busyness")
- 1-on-1 quality:
  - Frequency: 50% weekly, 35% biweekly, 15% monthly or ad hoc (goal 90% weekly)
  - Agenda: 30% have consistent agenda, 70% wing it (goal 80% structured)
  - Effectiveness: 6.8/10 avg (employees want more career development, less status updates)

**6) 30/60/90-DAY REMOTE OPTIMIZATION PLAN**
- 30 days: establish async-first norm (default to written updates, reserve meetings for complex dialogue); document top 20 decisions/processes in Notion (why, how, who); launch "no-meeting Fridays" (focus time); schedule virtual coffee roulette (auto-match teammates monthly)
- 60 days: train all 30 managers on remote leadership (8-hour workshop: async workflows, output-focused performance, effective 1-on-1s, building connection); set response time SLAs by channel (Slack urgent <1h, general <4h, email <24h); pilot "recorded async standups" (Loom videos, 2 min, replace some meetings)
- 90 days: measure engagement (goal 73%), burnout (goal <48 hrs/week), meeting hours (goal <16), Notion documentation (goal 60% of decisions); survey "collaborate across teams" (goal 55%), "feel included" (goal 78%); iterate based on feedback
- Metrics: engagement (goal 73% by 90 days), meeting hours (goal 16/week), "feel included" (goal 78%), documentation (goal 60% of decisions in Notion), manager 1-on-1 frequency (goal 75% weekly)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Default to async: document decisions, write updates, record meetings—don't assume everyone's in the room.
2) Overcommunicate context: remote work requires more explicit "why" and "how"—what's obvious to you isn't obvious to others.
3) Set clear response time expectations: urgent vs. async by channel—remove ambiguity and reduce anxiety.
4) Design social connection intentionally: virtual coffee, celebrations, and offsites don't happen accidentally—schedule them.
5) Train managers on remote leadership: office management skills don't translate—teach output-focus, async, and connection.
6) Measure outcomes, not activity: productivity is results delivered, not hours online or Slack messages sent.
7) Make meetings time-zone-friendly: rotate inconvenient times or record for async consumption—don't penalize geography.
8) Fight silos with documentation: tribal knowledge breeds silos—write it down, make it searchable, and share widely.
