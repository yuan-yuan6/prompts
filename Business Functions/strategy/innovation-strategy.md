# Innovation Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready an organization is to run a repeatable innovation strategy capability: defining focus areas, funding a balanced portfolio, executing experiments, and scaling validated initiatives into products, services, or process improvements.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess innovation strategy readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with an R&D/innovation budget of [INNOVATION_BUDGET] over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Innovation thesis & focus areas, (2) Portfolio & funding model, (3) Pipeline process & experimentation, (4) Talent & ecosystem partnerships, (5) IP, risk & compliance, (6) Metrics & governance. Provide a scorecard with evidence, the top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Innovation Thesis & Focus Areas
- 1 — Initial: Innovation goals are vague; focus areas shift frequently; success looks different by team.
- 3 — Defined: Clear innovation thesis linked to strategy; a small set of focus areas; criteria for what to pursue.
- 5 — Optimized: Thesis is stable and measurable; focus areas are validated by customer and market signals; decisions are fast and consistent.

### 2) Portfolio & Funding Model
- 1 — Initial: Projects are funded opportunistically; no portfolio view; spending is hard to track.
- 3 — Defined: Portfolio categories and guardrails exist; basic stage-based funding; capacity planning is visible.
- 5 — Optimized: Portfolio is actively managed; funding follows evidence; rebalancing happens on a cadence with clear decision rights.

### 3) Pipeline Process & Experimentation
- 1 — Initial: Ideation is informal; pilots are one-offs; limited hypothesis, measurement, or learning capture.
- 3 — Defined: Standard intake, experiment design, and stage gates; MVPs are measured against success criteria.
- 5 — Optimized: Rapid experimentation with reusable playbooks; strong learning loops; clear pathways from experiment to scale or stop.

### 4) Talent & Ecosystem Partnerships
- 1 — Initial: Skills are scarce; reliance on a few champions; partnerships are ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Core roles and skills exist; partnerships are purposeful; collaboration model is defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Deep capability bench; repeatable partner ecosystem; shared standards for co-development and evaluation.

### 5) IP, Risk & Compliance
- 1 — Initial: IP approach is unclear; data and compliance risks are discovered late.
- 3 — Defined: Basic IP and risk reviews; clear rules for data, vendors, and experimentation.
- 5 — Optimized: Integrated risk-by-design; documented IP strategy; scalable controls that do not slow iteration.

### 6) Metrics & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are inconsistent; reviews are irregular; decisions depend on personalities.
- 3 — Defined: Portfolio KPIs and review cadence; clear governance and escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Metrics drive allocation; outcomes are tracked post-scale; governance improves speed and quality of decisions.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Portfolio guardrails (categories, funding stages, evaluation criteria)
- Pipeline standard (intake, experiment design, stage gates)
- 90-day plan to improve throughput and learning quality
- Success metrics (cycle time, validated learnings, scaled initiatives, realized value)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INNOVATION_BUDGET]: Annual or multi-year innovation/R&D budget
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 12–24 months)
- [FOCUS_AREAS]: Target domains (e.g., automation, AI, new materials)
- [PORTFOLIO_MIX]: Desired mix across incremental/adjacent/breakthrough
- [PARTNER_TYPES]: Partners (startups, universities, vendors)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Retailer funding innovation across supply chain and personalization
- Scores (1–5): Thesis 2; Portfolio 2; Experimentation 3; Talent 2; Risk 2; Governance 2
- Top gaps: Unclear portfolio guardrails, weak IP/risk review, pilots not instrumented for learning
- 90-day priorities: Define focus areas + evaluation criteria; implement stage-based funding; standardize experiment template and measurement
