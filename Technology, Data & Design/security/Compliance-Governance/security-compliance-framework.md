# Security Compliance Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for achieving and maintaining security compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) including control implementation, evidence collection, audit preparation, and continuous compliance monitoring for organizations seeking certification or customer trust validation.

## Template

Achieve {COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORK} compliance for {INDUSTRY} organization ({EMPLOYEE_COUNT} employees, {CUSTOMER_COUNT} customers, {DATA_TYPES} data) with {BUSINESS_DRIVER} driving compliance within {TIMELINE_MONTHS} months.

**FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION**

SOC 2 Type II—Common Criteria: CC1 Control Environment (board oversight, ethics, organizational structure, accountability), CC2 Communication (internal/external processes, quality of information), CC3 Risk Assessment (risk identification, fraud assessment, change impact), CC4 Monitoring (ongoing evaluations, deficiency remediation), CC5 Control Activities (control selection, technology controls, policy deployment), CC6 Logical/Physical Access (access controls, removal processes), CC7 System Operations (change management, configuration, incident response, backup/recovery), CC8 Change Management (authorization, infrastructure maintenance), CC9 Risk Mitigation (vendor management, business continuity). Additional Criteria: A1 Availability (uptime monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, SLAs), C1 Confidentiality (data classification, encryption, retention, secure disposal), P1 Privacy (notice, choice, collection, use, access, disclosure, retention, quality, monitoring). Evidence Requirements: 6-12 month operating history (Type II vs Type I point-in-time), documented policies/procedures, control implementation evidence (screenshots, logs, configurations), testing evidence, management assertions, independent auditor testing (sampling 25-60 items per control). Auditor Selection: AICPA-licensed CPA firm, industry experience (SaaS/healthcare/fintech), report turnaround time (4-8 weeks post-fieldwork), cost ($15K-$75K depending on scope/complexity).

ISO 27001 ISMS—Risk-Based Approach: Establish context (scope, boundaries, interested parties), leadership commitment (ISMS policy, roles/responsibilities, resources), planning (risk assessment methodology, risk treatment plan, objectives), support (competence, awareness, communication, documented information), operation (risk assessment execution, risk treatment implementation, operational planning), performance evaluation (monitoring, measurement, internal audit, management review), improvement (nonconformity correction, continual improvement). Annex A Controls (93 controls, 14 domains): A.5 Organizational (policies, roles, segregation of duties), A.6 People (screening, employment terms, awareness, disciplinary), A.7 Physical (perimeter security, entry controls, equipment protection), A.8 Technological (endpoint security, privileged access, authentication, cryptography, backup, logging, malware protection, network security, secure development, security testing). Statement of Applicability: For each Annex A control, justify inclusion/exclusion, reference risk treatment decision, document implementation status. Certification Process: Stage 1 audit (documentation review, 1-2 days), gap remediation (4-8 weeks), Stage 2 audit (on-site control testing, 2-4 days), surveillance audits (annual year 1 and 2), recertification (year 3). Cost: $25K-$150K total (consultant $50-$200/hour, auditor $15K-$50K, tooling $10K-$30K annual).

HIPAA Security Rule—Administrative Safeguards (164.308): Security Management Process (risk analysis, risk management, sanction policy, information system activity review), Assigned Security Responsibility (CISO/security officer), Workforce Security (authorization, supervision, termination procedures, access controls), Information Access Management (isolating healthcare clearinghouse functions, access authorization, access establishment/modification), Security Awareness and Training (security reminders, protection from malicious software, log-in monitoring, password management), Security Incident Procedures (response and reporting), Contingency Plan (data backup, disaster recovery, emergency mode operation, testing/revision, applications and data criticality analysis), Evaluation (periodic technical/non-technical evaluation), Business Associate Contracts (written assurances of safeguards). Physical Safeguards (164.310): Facility Access Controls (contingency operations, facility security plan, access control/validation, maintenance records), Workstation Use/Security (policies on functions, physical attributes, proper use), Device and Media Controls (disposal, media re-use, accountability, data backup/storage). Technical Safeguards (164.312): Access Control (unique user identification, emergency access, automatic logoff, encryption/decryption), Audit Controls (hardware/software/procedural mechanisms recording/examining ePHI access), Integrity (ePHI alteration/destruction protection, electronic signatures), Person or Entity Authentication (verify identity claiming to be), Transmission Security (integrity controls, encryption). Breach Notification: <60 days to HHS if ≥500 individuals affected, individual notification within 60 days, annual notification for <500 individuals, business associate notification to covered entity within 60 days. Penalties: $100-$50K per violation (up to $1.5M annual maximum per violation category), criminal penalties (up to $250K fines, 10 years prison for wrongful disclosure with intent to sell/transfer/use for harm).

Cardholder Data Environment (CDE): In-scope systems (store/process/transmit cardholder data), connected-to systems (network access to CDE), security controls (impact CDE security). SAQ Types: A (card-not-present ecommerce, fully outsourced, 22 questions), A-EP (ecommerce with redirect, 181 questions), B (imprint machines or standalone dial-out terminals, 41 questions), B-IP (standalone IP terminals, 82 questions), C (payment application systems on merchant network, 160 questions), D (all others, full 329 questions). Validation: Level 1 (>6M transactions annual) requires QSA on-site assessment, Level 2-4 (<6M) self-assessment SAQ, quarterly network scans by ASV (Approved Scanning Vendor), annual penetration testing. Cost: $50K-$300K annual (tokenization/encryption infrastructure, quarterly scans $2K-$5K, annual pentest $15K-$40K, QSA assessment $25K-$100K for Level 1).

**COMPLIANCE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Planning/Gap Analysis (4-6 weeks)—Select framework based on business drivers (SOC 2 for SaaS sales, ISO 27001 for global enterprise, HIPAA for healthcare, PCI-DSS for payments), define scope (in-scope systems, data flows, geographic boundaries), conduct gap assessment (current vs required controls, quantify gaps as % of total controls), assign roles (compliance program manager, control owners, auditor liaison), create project plan (Gantt chart, milestones, budget $50K-$500K depending on framework/maturity). Tools: Vanta, Drata, SecureFrame (automated compliance platforms $12K-$48K annual), or manual spreadsheets.

Policy/Procedure Development (6-8 weeks)—Write required policies (information security, access control, incident response, business continuity, acceptable use, data classification, vendor management, change management, backup/recovery, cryptography), develop procedures (onboarding/offboarding, access request, incident handling, change approval, vulnerability management), create templates/forms (access request form, change request, incident report, risk assessment, vendor questionnaire), review/approval process (legal, HR, IT, executive sign-off), communication/training (all-hands announcement, policy portal, acknowledgment tracking). Best practice: Start with templates (SANS, NIST, vendor-provided), customize to organization, avoid generic boilerplate (auditors test whether policies are actually followed).

Control Implementation (3-6 months)—Technical controls: Deploy MFA (Okta, Duo, Azure AD conditional access), SIEM/logging (Splunk, Datadog, Elastic), encryption (TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest, AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault), EDR/antivirus (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender), vulnerability scanning (Tenable, Qualys, Rapid7), backup/DR (automated daily backups, 3-2-1 rule, quarterly restore testing), network segmentation (separate prod/dev, CDE isolation for PCI). Process controls: Quarterly access reviews (certify users still need access, remove within 24 hours of termination), change management (approval workflow, testing, rollback procedures), incident response (runbooks, tabletop exercises quarterly), vendor risk management (annual assessments, contract reviews, SLA monitoring), security awareness training (phishing simulations monthly, annual compliance training, track completion rates). Organizational controls: Security committee (quarterly meetings, risk reviews, policy updates), background checks (all employees, annual for privileged access), role-based access (least privilege, segregation of duties, approval matrix).

Evidence Collection (3-12 months for SOC 2 Type II)—Establish evidence repository (Google Drive/SharePoint with access controls, version control, retention policies), automate evidence collection (SIEM log exports, access review reports, training completion reports, vulnerability scan results, backup verification, configuration baselines), document control execution (screenshots with timestamps, ticket references, approver names), maintain audit trail (change logs, approval chains, incident timelines), regular control testing (quarterly internal audits, sampling approach, testing worksheets). Automation: Compliance platforms (Vanta, Drata) auto-collect 60-80% of evidence (AWS/GCP/Azure configurations, GitHub commits, HR system data, endpoint compliance), manual evidence (policy approvals, board minutes, training acknowledgments, vendor assessments) requires process discipline.

Audit Preparation (4-8 weeks)—Internal readiness assessment (self-audit against framework requirements, identify gaps, quantify remediation effort), remediate identified gaps (prioritize critical/high findings, defer low/info to post-audit), organize evidence packages (map evidence to control objectives, label clearly, index document), conduct mock audit (external consultant reviews evidence, provides feedback, estimates likelihood of exceptions), select auditor (RFP process, 3-5 bids, evaluate experience/cost/turnaround, check references). Auditor kickoff: Provide PBC (Prepared By Client) list, set fieldwork dates, identify interviewees, establish communication protocol, agree on report format/timing.

Audit Execution (2-4 weeks)—Opening meeting (scope confirmation, timeline review, logistical details), document review (auditor examines policies, procedures, evidence), control testing (sample selection 25-60 items per control, validate control operating effectiveness, interview control owners), interviews (1-hour sessions with 10-20 personnel, validate understanding and execution of controls), management response (address auditor questions, provide supplemental evidence, explain exceptions), closing meeting (preliminary findings, expected exceptions, timeline for final report). Common exceptions: Incomplete access reviews (missing approvals, untimely execution), insufficient evidence (screenshots lack timestamps, logs don't cover full period), policy gaps (procedures not documented, not approved by management), training gaps (personnel not trained within 30 days of hire, no acknowledgment records).

Continuous Compliance (Ongoing)—Quarterly control reviews (test sample of controls, validate still operating, update evidence), annual risk assessments (identify new risks from business changes, evaluate control effectiveness, update risk treatment plan), policy updates (annual review cycle, update for regulatory changes, version control), training refreshers (annual compliance training, monthly security awareness, phishing simulations), continuous monitoring (automated alerts for control failures, dashboard with compliance metrics, quarterly executive reporting). Surveillance audits: ISO 27001 annual surveillance (1-day audit, samples subset of controls), SOC 2 Type II annual renewal (3-12 month evidence period), PCI-DSS quarterly scans + annual assessment, HIPAA no formal audit but OCR audits 150-200 organizations annually.

Deliver compliance program as:

1. **GAP ASSESSMENT REPORT** - Current state vs framework requirements, % coverage, prioritized remediation plan
2. **CONTROL MATRIX** - All controls mapped to framework requirements, implementation status, control owners, testing frequency
3. **POLICY/PROCEDURE PACKAGE** - 15-25 policies and 30-50 procedures, approved by management, communicated to workforce
4. **EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN** - What evidence, collection method, frequency, responsible party, storage location
5. **AUDIT READINESS CHECKLIST** - 50-100 item checklist covering all control objectives, status tracking, remediation notes

**Prompt:** Achieve SOC 2 Type II (Security, Availability) for SaaS HR platform (85 employees, 1,200 customers, PII data, AWS infrastructure, 12-month timeline, customer sales enabler).

**Output:** Scope—AWS production environment (ECS containers, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, CloudFront), application code (React frontend, Node.js API), employee endpoints (managed by Jamf, SSO via Okta), exclude development/staging (not customer-facing). Gap Analysis—CC1 Control Environment: Board oversight missing (add security committee quarterly meetings), ethics policy generic (add security-specific code of conduct). CC2 Communication: Internal communication ad-hoc (formalize security@company email, Slack #security channel), external customer communication unclear (add security bulletin process, trust portal). CC3 Risk Assessment: No formal risk assessment (implement annual risk assessment, document in ISMS), fraud risk not addressed (add fraud risk procedures). CC6 Logical Access: MFA enabled for production (good), but not enforced for all employees (enforce Okta MFA for all apps), access reviews manual (automate quarterly with Okta API). CC7 System Operations: Change management informal (implement Jira change request workflow, require approval for prod changes), incident response plan exists but not tested (conduct quarterly tabletop exercises, document in runbooks), backups automated (RDS snapshots daily, S3 versioning) but not tested (add quarterly restore testing). CC9 Vendor Management: No vendor assessments (implement annual vendor risk reviews for critical vendors, require SOC 2 reports, SLA monitoring). A1 Availability: Uptime monitoring exists (Datadog with PagerDuty alerts, 99.9% SLA), DR plan documented (multi-AZ RDS, S3 cross-region replication) but not tested (conduct annual DR exercise, document RTO/RPO: 4 hours/15 minutes). Implementation Roadmap: Month 1-2 (policies: write 12 required policies, get executive approval, communicate to team), Month 3-5 (controls: enforce MFA, implement change management workflow, conduct access reviews, test backups, vendor assessments), Month 6-12 (evidence collection: screenshots monthly, log exports automated, maintain control testing worksheets), Month 13-14 (audit prep: organize evidence into 40-page PBC list, mock audit by external consultant, remediate gaps), Month 15-16 (audit execution: 2-week fieldwork, auditor testing, management responses, final SOC 2 Type II report issued). Evidence Automation: Vanta integration ($24K annual) auto-collects 70% of evidence (AWS configs, GitHub commits, Okta user list, Jamf endpoint compliance, training completion via BambooHR), manual evidence (board minutes, policy approvals, vendor assessments, DR test results, incident post-mortems). Auditor Selection: RFP to 4 firms (Big 4, regional CPA, specialized SOC 2 firm), select based on SaaS experience + cost ($28K fixed fee) + 6-week turnaround post-fieldwork. Outcome: SOC 2 Type II report issued Month 16, zero exceptions, 40-page report with management assertion and auditor opinion, publish to trust portal, enable enterprise sales pipeline (3 Fortune 500 deals closed within 90 days requiring SOC 2).
