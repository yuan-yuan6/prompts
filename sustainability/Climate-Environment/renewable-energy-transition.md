# Renewable Energy Transition Strategy Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive renewable energy procurement strategy to transition to 100% renewable electricity, eliminate Scope 2 emissions, reduce energy costs, evaluate clean energy options (on-site solar/wind, PPAs, green tariffs, RECs), and achieve renewable energy targets.

## Quick Start

**Need renewable energy strategy quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Manufacturing (12 facilities, 45,000 MWh/year electricity)
Current: 25% renewable (sporadic RECs)
Target: 100% renewable by 2028

Strategy Mix:
1. On-site Solar (30%): 8 MW rooftop/carport at 4 facilities
   - Generation: 13,500 MWh/year
   - Investment: $8M capex (or PPA)
   - Payback: 7 years

2. Virtual PPAs (50%): 23,000 MWh/year from utility-scale wind
   - Contract: 15-year VPPA
   - Price: $35/MWh (vs $42 grid)
   - Savings: $160K/year

3. Green Tariff (20%): 9,000 MWh through utility green pricing
   - Premium: $2/MWh over standard
   - Flexibility: Can adjust annually

Total Investment: $8M (on-site) + VPPA commitments
Annual Savings: $200K (energy) + avoid future carbon pricing
Scope 2 Reduction: 100% (eliminate 17,325 tCO2e/year)
```

### When to Use This
- Setting 100% renewable energy targets (RE100, SBTi)
- Eliminating Scope 2 emissions
- Responding to customer/investor renewable requirements
- Reducing electricity costs and price volatility
- Supporting net zero climate strategy

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Baseline & Target** - Current energy use, renewable %, set targets (1-2 weeks)
2. **Options Analysis** - Evaluate on-site, PPAs, green tariffs, RECs (3-4 weeks)
3. **Procurement Strategy** - Select optimal mix, negotiate contracts (4-8 weeks)
4. **Implementation** - Install systems, activate contracts, track (6-24 months)

- Investor expectations: [ESG_RATINGS]
- Cost reduction: [HEDGE_AGAINST_PRICE_VOLATILITY]
- Competitive positioning: [INDUSTRY_LEADERSHIP]

### 3. RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTIONS

Option 1: On-Site Solar (Rooftop/Carport/Ground-Mount)
Description: Install solar panels on company property
Typical Application: Own facilities with suitable roof/land

Pros:
- Highest additionality (new renewable capacity)
- Visible commitment
- Energy cost savings (after payback)
- Hedge against electricity price increases
- Can add battery storage

Cons:
- High upfront capital (if purchased)
- Long payback (5-10 years)
- Only feasible where strong solar resource
- Limited by roof/land availability
- Performance variability (weather)

Economic Models:
A. Direct Purchase:
- Capex: $1,000-1,500/kW installed
- O&M: $15-25/kW/year
- Payback: 6-8 years (varies by incentives/electricity rates)
- Ownership: Company owns, gets depreciation, tax credits

B. Solar PPA (Power Purchase Agreement):
- No upfront cost
- Pay only for electricity generated: $30-60/MWh (varies by region)
- Term: 10-25 years
- Ownership: Third-party owns, maintains

C. Solar Lease:
- Low upfront cost
- Monthly lease payments
- Ownership: Third-party owns

Feasibility Assessment:
Site: [FACILITY_NAME]
Roof area: [SQ_FT]
Solar potential: [KW_CAPACITY]
Annual generation: [MWH] - [% of site consumption]
Investment: [CAPEX or PPA_PRICE]
Savings: [ANNUAL_$ if purchased]

Option 2: Off-Site PPAs (Physical or Virtual)
Description: Long-term contract to buy renewable electricity from utility-scale project

Physical PPA:
- Electricity delivered via grid to your facilities
- Requires transmission availability
- Geographic limitations
- Typically utility-scale wind/solar (100+ MW projects)

Virtual PPA (VPPA):
- Financial contract, not physical delivery
- Renewable energy generated in Region A, you consume in Region B
- Financially settle difference between contract price and market price
- Enables access to best renewable resources regardless of location
- Most flexible for multi-site companies

VPPA Economics:
- Contract: 10-20 year fixed price
- Volume: [MWH/YEAR]
- Strike price: $[PRICE]/MWh
- Hedge: Protects against electricity price increases
- Renewable attributes: Receive RECs

Example:
- 15-year VPPA for 20,000 MWh/year
- Strike price: $35/MWh
- If market price $45/MWh: Developer pays you $10/MWh × 20,000 = $200K
- If market price $30/MWh: You pay developer $5/MWh × 20,000 = $100K
- You still buy retail electricity separately, but financially hedged

Pros:
- High additionality (funds new large-scale renewable projects)
- Cost-competitive
- Long-term price hedge
- No capex required
- Access to best resources (e.g., Texas wind)

Cons:
- Complex contracts
- Financial risk (price volatility)
- Long-term commitment (10-20 years)
- May need credit support

Option 3: Green Tariffs / Utility Green Pricing
Description: Opt into utility program to source renewable energy

How it works:
- Utility offers renewable energy option
- Premium pricing: $1-5/MWh over standard rate
- Utility matches your consumption with renewable generation (utility-scale)
- Receive RECs

Pros:
- Easy to implement (simple contract with utility)
- No capex
- Flexible (can often adjust annually)
- Additionality (many programs fund new renewable projects)

Cons:
- Limited availability (not all utilities offer)
- May be premium price
- Less control over renewable source
- Typically shorter commitment (annual)

Availability:
Check if your utility offers:
- Green pricing program
- Community solar
- Green tariff for large customers

Option 4: Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
Description: Purchase unbundled RECs (separate from electricity)

How it works:
- 1 REC = 1 MWh of renewable generation
- Buy RECs to match your electricity consumption
- Claim renewable energy use for that MWh

Types:
- Unbundled RECs: Buy from any generator, any region (lowest cost, lowest additionality)
- Bundled RECs: Come with electricity (PPA, green tariff)
- Green-e certified RECs: Meet quality standards

Pros:
- Immediate solution (can buy RECs today for 100% renewable)
- Low cost: $0.50-5/MWh typically
- Flexible (buy annually)
- No infrastructure needed

Cons:
- Lowest additionality (not funding new renewables, often buying from existing)
- Market credibility debate (some stakeholders discount RECs)
- Price variability
- Should be transition solution, not long-term strategy

Strategic Use:
- Bridge: Use RECs to get to 100% quickly while developing on-site/PPA projects
- Gap-fill: Cover remaining % after on-site and PPAs
- Not recommended: 100% RECs as long-term strategy (low additionality)

Option 5: Community Solar / Shared Renewables
Description: Subscribe to off-site shared solar project

How it works:
- Community solar project developed in region
- Subscribe for allocation (e.g., 100 kW)
- Receive credits on utility bill
- Receive RECs

Pros:
- No capex
- Good for renters or unsuitable roofs
- Support local renewable energy
- Moderate additionality

Cons:
- Limited availability (not all regions)
- Subscription limits
- Less control

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Manufacturing Company (Energy-Intensive)
```
Company: 12 facilities, 75,000 MWh/year, currently 15% renewable
Target: 100% by 2028
Strategy:
- On-site solar: 12 MW at 6 facilities (20,000 MWh) - $12M or PPA
- VPPA: 45,000 MWh from Texas wind farm (15-year) - $38/MWh
- Green tariff: 10,000 MWh where utility programs available
Result: 100% renewable, eliminate 28,875 tCO2e Scope 2, $400K annual savings
```

### Example 2: Technology Company (Offices + Data Centers)
```
Company: 15 offices + 2 co-located data centers, 150,000 MWh/year
Target: 100% by 2026 (already 60% from data center provider renewables)
Strategy:
- Data centers: Partner with Google Cloud, AWS (they provide renewable)
- Offices: On-site solar (rooftop + carport) 8 MW - 11,000 MWh
- VPPA: 25,000 MWh to cover gap
- RECs: Minimal gap-fill
Result: 100% renewable 2026, Scope 2 near-zero
```

### Example 3: Retail Company (Distributed Stores)
```
Company: 500 stores, 120,000 MWh/year, currently 25% renewable
Target: 75% by 2027, 100% by 2030
Strategy:
- On-site solar: 100 stores with best solar (25 MW total) - 35,000 MWh
- Green tariffs: 200 stores in markets with utility programs - 40,000 MWh
- VPPA: 35,000 MWh to fill gap
- RECs: Bridge to 100% in 2030
Result: 75% by 2027 (higher-quality), 100% by 2030
```

## Best Practices

1. **Additionality priority** - On-site > PPAs > Green tariffs > RECs
2. **Portfolio approach** - Mix of options optimizes cost and risk
3. **Long-term contracts** - PPAs lock in prices, hedge risk
4. **Start early** - On-site solar takes 12-18 months
5. **Track properly** - Use REC registries, market-based Scope 2

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **100% RECs** - Easy but low additionality, stakeholder skepticism
✅ Instead: Mix with on-site, PPAs for credibility

❌ **Waiting for perfect** - Analysis paralysis
✅ Instead: Start with quick wins (RECs), develop long-term projects

❌ **Ignoring economics** - Assuming renewable is always more expensive
✅ Instead: Many renewables now cost-competitive or cheaper

❌ **No VPPA** - Only considering on-site (limited by roof space)
✅ Instead: VPPAs unlock utility-scale renewables for any location

❌ **Forgetting RECs** - Even with on-site/PPAs, need RECs to claim renewable
✅ Instead: Ensure renewable attributes (RECs) included or purchased
