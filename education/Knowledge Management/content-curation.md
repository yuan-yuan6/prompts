# Content Curation & Libraries Management Framework Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive frameworks for resource collection, digital library management, content curation, knowledge repositories, and information resource organization systems for academic, corporate, and public institutions.

## Quick Start

**Get started in 3 minutes:**

1. **Define Collection Scope** - Identify institution type, library classification, service population, and subject focus
2. **Establish Selection Criteria** - Set quality standards for scholarly rigor, accuracy, currency, and relevance
3. **Choose Organization System** - Select classification method (Dewey, LC, or custom taxonomy)
4. **Setup Discovery Interface** - Implement basic search, browse categories, and faceted navigation

**Minimum Viable Content Library:**
- 1 collection policy defining scope and format specifications
- 1 acquisition method (purchase, licensing, or donations)
- 1 classification system for organizing resources
- 1 discovery interface (simple search + browse by category)
- 1 metadata standard (Dublin Core minimum)

Perfect for: Librarians, knowledge managers, digital archivists, content curators, and information professionals building resource collections.
