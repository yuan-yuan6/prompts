# Talent Acquisition Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to define and run a talent acquisition strategy aligned to business growth, with strong operating model, sourcing, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess TA strategy readiness for [ORGANIZATION] hiring [HEADCOUNT] roles/year across [ROLE_FAMILIES]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Workforce planning alignment, (2) Sourcing strategy, (3) Process & operating model, (4) Tooling & data, (5) Stakeholder governance, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Workforce Planning Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Hiring priorities unclear; plans change without alignment.
- 3 — Defined: Workforce plan, role priorities, and hiring calendars defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Planning is proactive; capacity and budget are managed predictably.

### 2) Sourcing Strategy
- 1 — Initial: Sourcing is reactive; pipelines are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Sourcing playbooks by role/segment; channel strategy defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Pipelines are predictable; sourcing efficiency improves over time.

### 3) Process & Operating Model
- 1 — Initial: Roles and handoffs unclear; bottlenecks common.
- 3 — Defined: Operating model and SLAs; standardized stages and approvals.
- 5 — Optimized: Process scales reliably; cycle time decreases without quality loss.

### 4) Tooling & Data
- 1 — Initial: Tools fragmented; reporting unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: ATS/CRM configured; data definitions; dashboards exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted; automation reduces admin; insights drive decisions.

### 5) Stakeholder Governance
- 1 — Initial: Decision rights unclear; approvals slow.
- 3 — Defined: Governance cadence; roles; escalation paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; accountability is clear and consistent.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No improvement loop; outcomes not connected to process.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs and targets; regular retrospectives and backlog.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves quality, speed, and equity.

## Deliverables
- TA readiness scorecard and prioritized gap list
- TA strategy brief (goals, roles, sourcing plan)
- Operating model and SLA map
- Tooling/data definitions and dashboard spec
- 90-day improvement plan with KPI targets

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [HEADCOUNT]: Annual hiring plan
- [ROLE_FAMILIES]: Role families
- [BUDGET]: Recruiting budget
- [SOURCING_CHANNELS]: Channels
- [TIME_TO_FILL]: Time-to-fill target

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Scaling team with inconsistent recruiting throughput
- Scores (1–5): Planning 2; Sourcing 3; Process 2; Data 2; Governance 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define operating SLAs; implement dashboards; tighten governance and sourcing playbooks
