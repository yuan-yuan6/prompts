# Thought Leadership Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build credible thought leadership across six dimensions: positioning, audience clarity, content system, proof/credibility, distribution, and sustainability. This framework identifies gaps and produces a 90-day execution plan.

## Template

Conduct a thought leadership readiness assessment for {EXPERT_PROFILE} aiming to achieve {OUTCOMES} within {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) POSITIONING & POINT OF VIEW**
- Clear niche and differentiated perspective (not generic “best practices”)
- A small set of repeatable themes (“pillars”) exists
- Tradeoffs are explicit (what you do *not* cover)

**2) AUDIENCE & PROBLEM CLARITY**
- Audience segment is specific (role, context, pain)
- The “job to be done” is clear (what changes for them)
- Language matches audience reality (avoids jargon or empty buzzwords)

**3) CONTENT SYSTEM & EXECUTION**
- Content cadence is realistic (weekly, biweekly, etc.)
- A repeatable writing/creation workflow exists (outline → draft → edit → publish)
- Repurposing strategy exists (one idea → multiple formats)

**4) PROOF, CREDIBILITY & ETHICS**
- Claims are grounded (experience, data, case examples)
- Responsible boundaries (no confidential leakage, no overstated certainty)
- A mechanism exists for referencing sources or methods where appropriate

**5) DISTRIBUTION & AMPLIFICATION**
- Channel fit is chosen intentionally (LinkedIn, newsletter, talks, podcasts)
- Basic packaging skills (hooks, titles, formats, CTAs)
- Relationship engine exists (peers, communities, collaborators)

**6) SUSTAINABILITY & FEEDBACK LOOP**
- Time and energy plan is sustainable (minimum viable week defined)
- Feedback loop exists (comments, conversations, analytics)
- Iteration is planned (what to double down on, what to drop)

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 30 days

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **CONTENT PILLARS & ASSETS**
- 3–5 content pillars
- 6–10 starter topics (1–2 per pillar)
- 1 “signature asset” outline (talk, essay, guide)

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Weeks 1–4: positioning + baseline content cadence
- Weeks 5–8: credibility + distribution expansion
- Weeks 9–12: signature asset + speaking/podcast pitching

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30/60/90-day targets for: published pieces, engagement rate, qualified inbound, speaking/podcast invites, newsletter subs (if used)

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc posting, unclear positioning)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some content, inconsistent quality/distribution)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable cadence, clear themes, growing audience)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (credible POV, strong distribution engine)
- 5.0: Optimized (compounding authority, consistent opportunities)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {EXPERT_PROFILE} | Who you are + niche context | “Healthcare tech consultant, 15 years, AI implementation” |
| {OUTCOMES} | Desired outcomes | “Generate consulting leads + get 2 talks booked” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “3 hours/week, prefers writing, cannot share client details” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {EXPERT_PROFILE}: Healthcare technology consultant (15 years), specializes in operational AI adoption in hospital systems
- {OUTCOMES}: Establish credibility on responsible AI implementation; generate 3 qualified inbound leads/month; land 1 conference talk in 90 days
- {CONSTRAINTS}: 3 hours/week; primary channel LinkedIn; cannot share client-identifiable details; prefers practical frameworks over hot takes

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.3/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities (30 days): (1) sharpen POV into 3 pillars, (2) publish weekly with a repeatable format, (3) add proof via anonymized patterns + lightweight metrics

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Positioning & POV | 3.5 | Clear domain + practical angle | Define sharper contrarian belief and boundaries |
| Audience & Problem | 3.0 | Targets hospitals broadly | Narrow to 1–2 roles and their daily constraints |
| Content System | 3.5 | Can write weekly | Create a fixed workflow + repurposing plan |
| Proof & Credibility | 3.0 | Strong experience but vague claims | Add anonymized case patterns + measurable outcomes |
| Distribution | 2.5 | LinkedIn only, limited networking | Add peer interactions + 10 warm relationships |
| Sustainability & Feedback | 4.0 | 3 hours/week is stable | Add metrics review and iteration rules |

3) **CONTENT PILLARS & ASSETS**
- Pillar 1: “AI in hospitals: where it breaks operationally”
- Pillar 2: “Responsible AI as an implementation constraint, not a slogan”
- Pillar 3: “Change management for clinician workflows”

Starter topics:
- “The 3 hidden failure modes of hospital AI pilots (and how to prevent them)”
- “Why ‘better models’ don’t fix broken workflows”
- “A 5-question readiness checklist before any vendor demo”
- “Anonymized pattern: what successful clinical adoption always includes”
- “Metrics that matter: adoption, drift, and operational burden”
- “How to design a human-AI workflow that clinicians trust”

Signature asset outline:
- Talk: “Operational AI in healthcare: a pragmatic playbook for adoption” (3 parts: readiness → pilot design → scale)

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Broad audience → vague resonance → pick primary audience (e.g., CIO + clinical ops leader)
- Gap 2: Claims feel generic → low proof density → add anonymized mini-case patterns and outcomes ranges
- Gap 3: Distribution is passive → low reach → comment on 10 peer posts/week + DM 2 peers/week
- Gap 4: No conversion path → lost leads → add a clear CTA (offer a short checklist or consult)
- Gap 5: No pitch pipeline → no talks → build a list of 15 events/podcasts and pitch weekly

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Weeks 1–4: define 3 pillars; publish 4 posts using one consistent format; build a “proof bank” of 10 anonymized insights
- Weeks 5–8: publish 4 more posts; add 1 long-form piece; start outreach (2 peers/week; 1 podcast pitch/week)
- Weeks 9–12: publish 4 posts; finalize signature talk; submit 5 speaking proposals; publish one “playbook” post as the flagship

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Published pieces: 0 → 12
- Engagement rate: baseline → +25% by day 90
- Qualified inbound leads: 0–1/month → 3/month
- Speaking/podcast invites: 0 → 1–2
- Relationship touches: 0 → 40 meaningful interactions

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Pick a narrow audience first** — depth creates authority faster than breadth.
2) **Write from a repeatable POV** — consistent themes compound.
3) **Increase proof density** — examples, numbers, and patterns beat slogans.
4) **Build a content system** — workflow matters more than inspiration.
5) **Repurpose aggressively** — one idea should produce multiple assets.
6) **Treat distribution as work** — relationships drive reach.
7) **Stay inside ethical boundaries** — anonymize and avoid confidential detail.
8) **Review monthly and iterate** — double down on what converts, drop what doesn’t.
