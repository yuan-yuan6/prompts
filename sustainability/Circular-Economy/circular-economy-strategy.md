# Circular Economy Strategy & Business Model Design Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive circular economy strategy, design circular business models, create products for circularity (durability, repair, reuse, recycling), implement take-back and refurbishment programs, transition from linear to circular value chains, and unlock economic and environmental value.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Electronics manufacturer ($800M revenue)
Current: Linear model (make-use-dispose), 15% recycled content, minimal take-back
Circular Vision: "100% circular products by 2035 - designed for longevity, repair, and full material recovery"

Circular Strategy (3 horizons):
1. Product Design (2025-2027): Modular design, 50% recycled content, 10-year lifespan
2. Service Models (2027-2030): Product-as-a-service pilot, refurbishment scale-up, take-back 30%
3. Closed-Loop (2030-2035): 80% materials recovered and reused, circular supply agreements

Pilot Program: Take-back 5,000 units/year (2025), refurbish/resell or recycle
Investment: $15M (design, reverse logistics, refurb facility)
Value: $8M annual savings (materials), $12M new revenue (refurb), brand leadership
```

### When to Use This
- Developing circular economy strategy and roadmap
- Designing products for circularity and longevity
- Implementing product take-back and refurbishment
- Reducing waste and virgin material use
- Creating new circular business models (PaaS, leasing)

### Basic 5-Step Workflow
1. **Circular Assessment** - Analyze current linear model, identify opportunities (2-3 weeks)
2. **Strategy Development** - Define circular vision, business models, targets (4-6 weeks)
3. **Product Design** - Redesign for durability, modularity, recyclability (3-6 months)
4. **Pilot Programs** - Test take-back, refurb, new models (6-12 months)
5. **Scale & Transform** - Expand circular programs, transform value chain (3-5 years)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Electronics Manufacturer
```
Company: Consumer electronics ($1.5B revenue)
Strategy: Modular design, take-back, refurbishment, PaaS (B2B)
Programs: Take back 25% by 2028, refurb generates $80M revenue, PaaS 10% revenue
Materials: 65% recycled content by 2030, closed-loop aluminum/plastic
Investment: $35M (design, reverse logistics, refurb facilities)
Result: 55% circularity by 2030, $120M annual circular value
```

### Example 2: Fashion Retailer
```
Company: Apparel brand ($800M revenue)
Strategy: Sustainable materials, rental/resale, textile recycling
Programs: Rental service (20% revenue by 2030), resale platform, recycle unwearable
Materials: 80% sustainable fibers by 2028, 30% recycled polyester
Investment: $20M (circular design, rental ops, recycling partnerships)
Result: 40% circularity, extended customer lifetime value, brand leadership
```

### Example 3: Furniture Manufacturer
```
Company: Office furniture ($500M revenue, B2B)
Strategy: Modular design, leasing model, remanufacturing
Programs: Furniture-as-a-Service (lease not sell), take-back, remanufacture
Materials: 70% recycled steel/aluminum, FSC-certified wood
Investment: $15M (design, reverse logistics, refurb facility)
Result: 50% revenue from leasing by 2030, 70% circularity, customer stickiness
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with design** - Circular economy begins at product design stage
2. **Pilot before scaling** - Test take-back and refurb with one product line
3. **Customer value** - Make circular options attractive (quality, price, convenience)
4. **Economic viability** - Circular models must be profitable to scale
5. **Systems thinking** - Optimize whole system, not just one part

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **End-of-life only** - Only focusing on recycling, ignoring design and use phase
✅ Instead: Design for circularity from the start (durability, repair, disassembly)

❌ **Refurb without demand** - Building refurb capacity without market
✅ Instead: Validate customer demand for refurbished products first

❌ **Complex materials** - Products with 20 different materials hard to recycle
✅ Instead: Simplify materials (mono-materials where possible)

❌ **No reverse logistics** - Want take-back but no cost-effective collection
✅ Instead: Design efficient reverse logistics (consolidation, routing)

❌ **Circular washing** - Claiming "circular" without substantive change
✅ Instead: Measurable circularity (MCI, take-back %, recycled content)
