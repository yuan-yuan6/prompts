# ESG Performance Metrics & KPIs Template

## Purpose
Define comprehensive, measurable ESG metrics and KPIs that track performance, demonstrate accountability, enable data-driven decision-making, meet stakeholder expectations, support regulatory disclosure, and drive continuous improvement toward sustainability goals.

## Quick Start

**Need ESG metrics quickly?** Use this streamlined approach:

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Mid-size manufacturing company
Core ESG Metrics:

Environmental:
- GHG emissions (Scope 1+2): 25,000 tCO2e → Target: 15,000 by 2030 (-40%)
- Renewable energy: 30% → Target: 75% by 2028
- Waste diversion: 60% → Target: 90% by 2027 (zero waste to landfill goal)

Social:
- LTIR (Lost Time Injury Rate): 2.3 → Target: <1.5 by 2026
- Diverse leadership: 28% women → Target: 40% by 2028
- Employee engagement: 72 → Target: 80+ by 2026

Governance:
- Board diversity: 33% women → Target: 40% by 2026
- Ethics training: 95% → Target: 100% annually
- ESG-linked compensation: 0% → Target: 20% of exec variable comp by 2026

Data System: Sustainability software platform, quarterly reporting, external assurance (annual)
```

### When to Use This
- Developing ESG strategy (metrics demonstrate commitment)
- Establishing baseline performance for target-setting
- Responding to investor ESG data requests
- Preparing for ESG reporting and disclosure requirements
- Building ESG data management infrastructure
- Tracking performance and accountability

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Metric Selection** - Choose relevant ESG metrics aligned with strategy and frameworks (1-2 weeks)
2. **Baseline Establishment** - Collect data to establish current performance (3-4 weeks)
3. **Target Setting** - Set ambitious but achievable targets (2-3 weeks)
4. **Data Management** - Implement systems for ongoing measurement and reporting (4-8 weeks)

## Best Practices

### Metric Selection
1. **Material first** - Focus on metrics for material ESG topics
2. **Aligned to strategy** - Metrics should track strategy execution
3. **Framework-aligned** - Use GRI, SASB, TCFD standard metrics
4. **Stakeholder-relevant** - What investors, customers, employees care about
5. **Manageable number** - 15-25 core metrics, not 100+

### Target Setting
1. **Science-based** - Climate targets aligned with climate science (SBTi)
2. **Ambitious but achievable** - Stretch goals that are credible
3. **Time-bound** - Specific year for achievement
4. **Absolute and intensity** - Both types have value
5. **Interim milestones** - Short-term targets toward long-term goals

### Data Management
1. **Single source of truth** - Centralized ESG data platform
2. **Clear ownership** - Data owner for each metric
3. **Documented methodology** - How each metric calculated
4. **Quality controls** - Same rigor as financial data
5. **Assurance-ready** - Prepare for external verification

### Measurement
1. **Accurate baselines** - Know where you start
2. **Consistent methodology** - Don't change calculation methods
3. **Comprehensive boundary** - Include all relevant operations
4. **Primary data preferred** - Better than estimates
5. **Disclose limitations** - Transparent about data gaps

### Reporting
1. **Multi-year trends** - Show progress over time
2. **Targets and actuals** - Where you are vs. where you're going
3. **Contextualize** - Benchmarks, commentary, drivers
4. **Segment when useful** - By region, facility, product
5. **Balanced** - Celebrate progress, acknowledge challenges

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Metric overload** - Tracking 50+ metrics, reporting 30+
✅ Instead: Focus on 15-25 core metrics for material topics

❌ **Vanity metrics** - Impressive-sounding but not meaningful
✅ Instead: Metrics that stakeholders care about and drive real impact

❌ **Intensity only** - Only reporting intensity (per revenue), hiding absolute increases
✅ Instead: Report both absolute and intensity metrics

❌ **No baselines** - Setting targets without knowing current performance
✅ Instead: Establish baseline first, then set targets

❌ **Unrealistic targets** - Aspirational goals with no credible pathway
✅ Instead: Ambitious but achievable targets with clear roadmap

❌ **Inconsistent methodology** - Changing calculation methods year-to-year
✅ Instead: Consistent methodology; if changes needed, restate prior years

❌ **Poor data quality** - Estimates, incomplete data, no validation
✅ Instead: Robust data collection with quality controls and documentation

❌ **No ownership** - Unclear who's responsible for each metric
✅ Instead: Clear data owner for collection, validation, reporting of each metric

❌ **Manual spreadsheets** - Excel-based data management at scale
✅ Instead: ESG data management platform for efficiency and control

❌ **Ignoring Scope 3** - Only measuring Scope 1&2 (often <20% of footprint)
✅ Instead: Measure Scope 3 (value chain often 80%+), acknowledge data limitations
