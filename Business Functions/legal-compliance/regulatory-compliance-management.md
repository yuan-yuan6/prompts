# Compliance Management Template Generator

## Purpose
Create comprehensive compliance management strategies covering regulatory frameworks, compliance program development, risk assessment, monitoring systems, and governance structures to ensure organizational adherence to legal, regulatory, and industry requirements while minimizing compliance risk.

## Quick Compliance Management Prompt
Manage compliance for [organization] in [industry]. Regulatory inventory: [federal/state/international] by [functional area]. Risk assessment: top 10 risks by probability × impact. Policy framework: 4-tier hierarchy with [annual] review. GRC technology: [platform] for policy management, risk tracking, incident reporting. KPIs: training [X%], violations, audit findings. Board reporting: [quarterly] executive dashboard.

## Quick Start

Establish comprehensive compliance management in 5 steps:

1. **Conduct Regulatory Inventory**: Document all applicable federal, state, local, and international regulations—categorize by functional area (financial, privacy, labor, environmental) and enforcement authority
2. **Perform Risk Assessment**: Evaluate inherent compliance risks using probability × impact scoring—identify top 10 risks that could result in regulatory penalties, operational disruption, or reputational damage
3. **Build Policy Framework**: Create a 4-tier policy hierarchy (Tier 1: high-level policies, Tier 2: standards, Tier 3: procedures, Tier 4: work instructions) with clear ownership and annual review cycles
4. **Implement GRC Technology**: Deploy a Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) platform to centralize policy management, automate risk assessments, track incidents, and generate regulatory reports
5. **Establish Metrics & Reporting**: Define compliance KPIs (training completion %, policy violations, audit findings, regulatory exam results) and create executive dashboards for board-level oversight

**Pro Tip**: Integrate compliance into business processes from the start—embedding compliance checkpoints in workflows (e.g., contract approval, vendor onboarding, product launch) prevents violations more effectively than retroactive audits.
