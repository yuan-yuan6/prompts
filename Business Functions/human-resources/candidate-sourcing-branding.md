# Candidate Sourcing & Employer Branding Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to source candidates consistently and strengthen employer branding through clear ICP/personas, channel strategy, messaging, and measurable pipeline outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess sourcing and employer branding readiness for [ROLE_FAMILY] with target [PIPELINE_TARGET] qualified candidates/month. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Talent personas & targeting, (2) Channel strategy, (3) Outreach messaging & content, (4) Sourcing operations & tooling, (5) Employer brand consistency, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Talent Personas & Targeting
- 1 — Initial: Targeting is broad; candidate quality is unpredictable.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and sourcing criteria documented; segments prioritized.
- 5 — Optimized: Targeting is refined by response and hire outcomes; segments are operationalized.

### 2) Channel Strategy
- 1 — Initial: Channels chosen opportunistically; performance unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Channel mix planned by persona; budget and cadence defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Channel strategy is optimized; scaling is repeatable.

### 3) Outreach Messaging & Content
- 1 — Initial: Messages are generic; low response rates.
- 3 — Defined: Messaging aligned to personas; templates and proof points exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Messaging is tested and improved; personalization scales.

### 4) Sourcing Operations & Tooling
- 1 — Initial: Sourcing is manual; tracking inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Workflow, SLAs, and ATS/CRM usage defined; templates standardized.
- 5 — Optimized: Automation reduces manual work; pipeline is predictable.

### 5) Employer Brand Consistency
- 1 — Initial: Brand story is unclear; inconsistent across touchpoints.
- 3 — Defined: Employer brand pillars and content library; consistent candidate journey.
- 5 — Optimized: Employer brand is measured and strengthened; improves conversion and acceptance.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: Metrics focus on volume; learnings not captured.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs (response, conversion, time-to-fill) and cadence defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization loop improves quality and speed; learnings are reusable.

## Deliverables
- Sourcing readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Talent personas and targeting criteria
- Channel plan and outreach templates
- Sourcing workflow with SLAs and tooling guidance
- KPI dashboard and optimization cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ROLE_FAMILY]: Target role family
- [PIPELINE_TARGET]: Qualified candidates/month
- [CHANNELS]: LinkedIn, referrals, events, communities
- [MESSAGE_PILLARS]: Messaging pillars
- [ATS_CRM]: ATS/CRM tooling
- [OFFER_ACCEPT_RATE]: Offer acceptance baseline

## Example (Condensed)
- Hiring: Engineering roles with low outbound response
- Scores (1–5): Personas 2; Channels 3; Messaging 2; Ops 2; Brand 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define personas; improve messaging templates; implement SLAs and KPI cadence
