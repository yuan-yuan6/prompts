# Article Writing Framework

## Purpose
Create compelling articles, blog posts, news stories, and feature pieces with engaging hooks, structured content, SEO optimization, and clear calls-to-action for digital publications, corporate blogs, magazines, and content marketing campaigns achieving reader engagement and measurable outcomes.

## Template

Write {WORD_COUNT}-word {ARTICLE_TYPE} about {TOPIC} for {TARGET_AUDIENCE} ({AGE_RANGE}, {INTERESTS}, {READING_HABITS}) targeting {PUBLICATION} achieving {PAGEVIEWS_GOAL} pageviews, {TIME_ON_PAGE_MINUTES} minutes time-on-page, {ENGAGEMENT_RATE}% engagement rate.

**ARTICLE STRATEGY**

Topic Angle—Unique Perspective: Avoid generic rehash of existing content (Google search reveals what's already written, find gap or fresh angle), contrarian take challenges conventional wisdom (data supports position not just opinion), timeliness hook to current events or trends (newsjacking with value-add not exploitation), niche depth specific subset of broad topic (not "social media marketing" but "Instagram Reels strategy for B2B SaaS companies"), problem-solution specificity (not "productivity tips" but "how to recover 10 hours weekly by batching email responses"). Content Goals: Traffic (SEO-optimized for organic search, keyword research volume + difficulty balance, topical authority building), engagement (comments/shares/saves, controversial or actionable content, emotional resonance anger/joy/surprise), conversion (lead generation gated content, product awareness soft sell not advertorial, affiliate revenue product recommendations authentic), authority (thought leadership establishes expertise, conference speaking invitations, media quote requests), relationship (community building newsletter growth, trust development over time).

Audience Research—Demographics and Psychographics: Age and life stage (Gen Z 18-25 prefers short-form 500-800 words, Millennials 26-40 deep-dives 1500-2500 words, Gen X/Boomers 40+ tolerance for longer nuanced pieces 3000+ words acceptable), professional level (C-suite executives want strategic insights not tactical how-to, mid-level managers need actionable frameworks, entry-level comprehensive step-by-step), pain points and desires (what frustrates them professionally/personally, what aspirations drive them, emotional triggers fear/ambition/belonging), content consumption habits (morning commute skimming on mobile, lunch break focused reading, evening leisure long-form exploration, weekend binge-reading archives). Search Intent: Informational (learning and research, comprehensive coverage, neutral objective tone, "what is X", "how does Y work"), navigational (finding specific brand or page, branded keywords, comparison posts, "X vs Y", "best Z for [use case]"), transactional (purchase intent, product reviews and recommendations, affiliate opportunity, "buy X", "X coupon", "X pricing"), commercial investigation (pre-purchase research, detailed comparisons, buyer guides, "X review", "is Y worth it").

Competitive Analysis—SERP Research: Top 10 results (what format dominates: listicles/how-tos/comparisons, what length 500-5000 words distribution, what angle each takes, content gaps to exploit), featured snippets (paragraph/list/table format winning position zero, optimize to steal snippet with concise answer + deeper context below), People Also Ask (secondary questions to address in article, expand content depth, H2/H3 subheadings match PAA queries), related searches (keyword variations and longtail opportunities, user intent refinement). Content Differentiation: Better data (original research/survey, exclusive interviews, proprietary tools/calculators, screenshots and real examples not stock photos), deeper analysis (nuance and complexity competitors oversimplify, counterintuitive insights backed by evidence, frameworks synthesize disparate information), superior UX (scannable formatting white space, visual hierarchy clear, loading speed <3 seconds, mobile responsive 60%+ traffic mobile), fresher publish date (Google favors recent on timely topics, update old content with current data, publish date strategy depends on evergreen vs trending).

**ARTICLE STRUCTURE**

Headline Optimization—Formula Types: Number headline (odd numbers 7/9 convert better than even, "17 Ways to X" implies comprehensive, brackets add context "[2025 Guide]"), How-To headline (clear promise delivery, "How to Achieve X in Y Days Without Z", specificity beats vague), Question headline (curiosity gap reader must click to answer, "Is X Really Worth the Hype?", taps into existing wonder), Negative angle (stands out in positive noise, "Stop Doing X—It's Killing Your Y", fear/loss aversion powerful), Ultimate/Complete guide (authority positioning, "The Complete Guide to X: Everything You Need in One Place"). Power Words: Emotional (shocking, remarkable, stunning, heartbreaking, hilarious, inspiring trigger feeling), value (free, proven, guaranteed, ultimate, essential, exclusive signal benefit), urgency (now, today, fast, instant, limited, deadline drive action), curiosity (secret, hidden, untold, surprising, confess, exposed create gap), credibility (research, study, expert, proven, science, data build trust). Testing and Iteration: A/B test headlines (email subject lines, social media posts, same article different headlines), analyze CTR (aim 2-5% organic search, 5-15% email, 15-25% social), character count (60 characters max for Google truncation, 70 ideal for full display, front-load keywords), title tag vs H1 (title tag 50-60 chars SEO-focused, H1 can be longer/creative reader-focused).

Opening Hook—Hook Types: Statistic shock ("87% of marketers fail at X" grabs attention if true and sourced), story/anecdote (personal narrative 2-3 paragraphs, reader identifies with protagonist, stakes established), question (rhetorical engages reader's mind, specific not generic "What if you could X?"), bold statement (contrarian claim backed later, "Everything you know about X is wrong"), problem amplification (describe pain vividly before solving it, "You spend 10 hours weekly on X, achieving mediocre results. There's a better way."). First Paragraph Function: Expand hook into context (why this matters now, who this affects, what's at stake), promise specific value (what reader will learn/gain/achieve by article end, quantify if possible "5 actionable strategies", "framework used by 10,000+ companies"), establish credibility (why you/your publication qualified to write this, expertise/experience/research backing), smooth transition to body (preview structure without table of contents unless 5000+ words, maintain flow don't interrupt momentum). Avoiding Pitfalls: No throat-clearing ("In today's fast-paced world..." delete filler, get to point immediately), no dictionary definitions (unless redefining term, "According to Merriam-Webster, X is..." amateurish), no apology or uncertainty ("I'm no expert but...", "This might not work for everyone but..." undermines authority), front-load value (mobile users decide in 15 seconds, critical info above fold, "bury the lede" journalism advice doesn't apply to web writing).

Body Organization—Structure Patterns: Chronological (step-by-step processes, historical narratives, timeline-based, "First X, then Y, finally Z" natural progression), problem-solution (identify pain amplify it, introduce solution with evidence, implementation details, "Here's the problem, here's the fix, here's how"), framework-based (introduce model/system, explain each component, application examples, "The 4Cs of X: Component, Component, Component, Component"), comparison (side-by-side analysis of options, pros/cons, use cases, recommendation, "X vs Y: Which is right for you?"), listicle (numbered or bulleted items, most scannable format, each item 100-300 words mini-essay, "10 Ways to X" consistent structure per item). Subheading Strategy: H2 every 300-500 words (visual break aids scannability, allows skimming readers to jump to relevant section), keyword-optimized (include semantic keywords and longtail phrases, natural language not keyword stuffing, "How to Optimize X" not "X Optimization Tips Guide 2025"), benefit-focused (what reader gains from section, "Save 5 Hours Weekly with This Email Strategy" > "Email Management"), question format (taps into PAA and voice search, "What's the Best Time to Post on LinkedIn?" directly answerable), parallel structure (consistent format across same-level subheadings, all "How to X" or all "Why Y Matters" not mixed unless intentional shift).

Evidence and Credibility—Data Integration: Statistics sourcing (cite original research not secondary, link to source inline or footnote, recency matters 2020 data stale for tech topics current for historical, visualize with charts/graphs if >3 data points), case studies (real company/person examples with specifics, "Acme Corp increased X by 40% using Y approach", permission if identifiable or anonymize, before/after compelling), expert quotes (interview subject matter experts, 1-3 sentences punchy not rambling paragraphs, attribution with title/company for credibility, diversity of perspectives if controversial topic). Examples and Analogies: Concrete specifics (not "a company did X" but "Shopify increased Y by Z% by doing X", named examples memorable), relatable analogies (complex concepts simplified through comparison, "X is like Y that everyone understands", metaphor extended through section for clarity), templates and frameworks (downloadable/embeddable tools, spreadsheet calculators, swipe files, Notion databases, tangible takeaway increases saves/shares). Storytelling Techniques: Mini-narratives (customer journey 2-3 paragraphs, obstacle→action→result story arc, emotional connection builds engagement), vivid details (sensory descriptions, dialogue snippets, specific numbers not rounded, "at 3:47am" more real than "late at night"), protagonist reader identifies with (similar demographics/challenges/goals to target audience, aspirational but achievable not superhuman).

Conclusion Strategy—Summary and Synthesis: Key takeaways (3-5 main points bullet list optional, reinforce learning without repeating verbatim body content), answer "so what?" (why this matters beyond tactical tips, bigger picture implications, shift reader worldview), callback to introduction (closing loop satisfying, reference opening hook or story, narrative cohesion). Call-to-Action Types: Low commitment (subscribe to newsletter, follow on social media, bookmark/save article, download free resource), medium commitment (leave comment with opinion/question, share with specific person who'd benefit, join community/forum), high commitment (purchase product/service, book consultation, sign up for paid course, apply for job). CTA Placement: Within text (contextual CTAs at natural breaking points, "Download our X template here" inline with content), end of article (primary CTA after value delivered, specific action not generic "contact us"), sidebar/footer (persistent less intrusive, email signup offering lead magnet).

**WRITING CRAFT**

Tone and Voice—Tone Selection: Conversational (contractions, personal pronouns "you/we", casual language, humor appropriate, "Let's dive in" vs "We shall examine"), professional (formal but not stuffy, industry terminology used correctly, respectful of reader intelligence, "Consider this approach" measured tone), authoritative (definitive statements backed by expertise, prescriptive "Do X not Y", academic rigor without jargon, "Research demonstrates" evidence-based), storytelling (narrative arc, character development, emotional peaks/valleys, "She realized in that moment" dramatic), humorous (witty observations, self-deprecation, pop culture references, "spoiler alert" meta-commentary). Voice Consistency: Brand alignment (match publication's established voice, HubSpot conversational/helpful, Harvard Business Review analytical/serious, BuzzFeed playful/millennial), author personality (authentic not manufactured, consistent across articles builds reader relationship, quirks make memorable), audience expectation (C-suite doesn't want memes, Gen Z doesn't want stuffiness, match sophistication level). Avoiding Common Traps: Corporate speak ("leverage synergies", "best-in-class solutions", "paradigm shift" buzzword bingo alienates), passive voice (subject receives action not performs, "Mistakes were made" vs "We made mistakes", weakens prose), qualifier overload ("sort of", "kind of", "maybe", "might" hedge language undermines authority unless intentional humility).

Readability Optimization—Flesch Reading Ease: Target 60-70 (conversational English, 8th-9th grade level, most online content sweet spot), 70-80 (fairly easy, 7th grade, younger audiences or complex topics simplified), 50-60 (standard, high school, business/professional acceptable), below 50 (difficult, college level, academic/technical only if audience demands). Sentence Variety: Short sentences (punchy emphasis, 5-10 words, "This changes everything. Here's how."), medium sentences (workhorse 15-20 words, clear subject-verb-object, most sentences fall here), long sentences (occasional 25-35 words, complex idea subordinate clauses, rhythm variation), paragraph breaks (2-4 sentences optimal web reading, single-sentence paragraphs emphasis, 5+ sentences acceptable print not web). Formatting for Scannability: Bold key phrases (not full sentences, highlight takeaways, 1-2 per section, aids skimmers), bullet lists (3-7 items ideal, parallel structure, capitalize consistently, not overused or entire article bullets loses impact), numbered lists (when order matters, expectations set by number "7 steps" reader knows what to expect), blockquotes (pull quotes 1-2 sentences, visually breaks text, social sharing snippets, authority quotes from experts). Visual Hierarchy: H2/H3 logical (H1 title once, H2 main sections, H3 subsections, don't skip levels H1→H3, semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO), white space generous (margins, line height 1.5-1.8, paragraph spacing, not cramped walls of text), color contrast (dark text on light background, WCAG AA minimum 4.5:1 ratio, link color distinct from text blue default safest).

**SEO OPTIMIZATION**

Keyword Research—Search Volume and Difficulty: Primary keyword (main topic, 1K-10K monthly searches sweet spot, difficulty <50 for new sites, include in title/H1/first paragraph/URL), secondary keywords (2-5 related terms, 100-1K searches, semantic variations not exact match stuffing, sprinkle naturally throughout body), long-tail keywords (3-5 word phrases, 10-100 searches low competition, "how to optimize Instagram Reels for B2B" vs "Instagram marketing", easier to rank, higher intent). Keyword Placement: Title tag (50-60 characters, primary keyword front-loaded, brand at end optional "Primary Keyword Guide | Brand Name"), meta description (150-160 characters, include primary + secondary keywords, compelling CTA click-through, not ranking factor but CTR indirect factor), URL slug (short readable hyphenated, /primary-keyword-guide/ not /p=12345 or long-title-with-every-word), first 100 words (keyword in opening paragraph signals relevance, natural placement not forced). Semantic SEO: Topic clusters (pillar content 3000+ words comprehensive, cluster content 1000-1500 words specific subtopics, internal link cluster to pillar bidirectionally), LSI keywords (latent semantic indexing, Google understands synonyms/related terms, "automobile" article can rank for "car" without exact match, vary vocabulary naturally), entity optimization (people/places/brands Google recognizes, markup with schema.org, Knowledge Graph connection, E-E-A-T signals expertise/authority/trust).

On-Page Optimization—Header Tags: H1 once (page title, most important keyword, compelling for readers, 40-60 characters), H2 main sections (5-10 per article, keyword variations, descriptive not clever, answer user intent), H3 subsections (break long sections, support skimming, less critical for SEO but UX matters), hierarchy logical (outline structure, breadcrumb trail for readers and crawlers). Internal Linking: Anchor text descriptive (not "click here" but "our guide to X", keyword-rich but natural, accessibility screen readers), relevant context (link to related articles that add value, not every mention of topic requires link, 2-5 internal links per 1000 words reasonable), link depth (new content link from high-authority pages, orphan pages with no internal links struggle to rank, silo architecture cluster related content), link juice flow (avoid no-follow on internal links unless specific reason, dofollow passes PageRank, strategic linking boosts priority pages). External Linking: Authority sources (Wikipedia, .edu/.gov, industry leaders, original research, boosts credibility not SEO directly), citation format (inline links preferred for web, footnotes/bibliography for academic tone, "According to HubSpot" linked text), link quality over quantity (1-3 high-authority external links > 10 mediocre, avoid link farms/PBNs, Google penalty risk), open in new tab (debated UX decision, external links new tab keeps users on site, internal links same tab, user preference varies).

Technical SEO—Page Speed: Load time <3 seconds (Google ranking factor, bounce rate increases exponentially >3 seconds, test with PageSpeed Insights/GTmetrix), image optimization (compress with TinyPNG/ImageOptim, WebP format modern, lazy loading below fold, appropriate dimensions not 4000px downsized to 400px), minify code (CSS/JavaScript compressed, remove whitespace/comments, use CDN for static assets), mobile-first (60%+ traffic mobile, responsive design not separate m. subdomain, viewport meta tag, touch targets 48×48px minimum). Schema Markup: Article schema (headline, datePublished, dateModified, author, publisher, image required fields, JSON-LD format in <head> or <script>, Google rich results eligibility), FAQ schema (question-answer pairs for sections, appears in PAA potentially, enhances SERP real estate), breadcrumb schema (navigation trail, helps Google understand site hierarchy, appears in search results). Core Web Vitals: LCP Largest Contentful Paint (<2.5 seconds, main content visible, optimize hero image, server response time), FID First Input Delay (<100ms, interactivity, minimize JavaScript blocking), CLS Cumulative Layout Shift (<0.1, visual stability, set image dimensions, avoid dynamically injected content above fold).

**CONTENT PROMOTION**

Distribution Channels—Owned Media: Blog/website (primary publication platform, build SEO authority, email capture, analytics control full), email newsletter (highest ROI channel, personal inbox privileged space, segment by interest/behavior, 20-30% open rate goal), social media (LinkedIn B2B professional, Twitter/X news/commentary, Facebook older demo, Instagram visual younger), podcast (repurpose article as episode, audio commute/workout content, transcript back to article SEO). Earned Media: Guest posting (authority sites in niche, byline with link to site, exposure to new audience, quality over quantity, editorial standards match yours), media coverage (pitch journalists article as source, HARO respond to queries, builds backlinks + brand awareness), influencer shares (relationship building not cold pitching, tag in social posts, genuine value to their audience), organic social (others share without prompting, social proof, engagement algorithms boost reach). Paid Amplification: Content promotion (Facebook/LinkedIn ads $50-500 boost high-performing content, retarget website visitors, lookalike audiences, measure CPM/CPC), native advertising (Outbrain/Taboola "recommended content" widgets, appear on major media sites, $0.10-1.00 CPC, test headlines/images), sponsored content (Medium Partner Program, LinkedIn Newsletter, Substack promotion, platform revenue share or CPC), influencer partnerships (pay influencers to share, FTC disclosure required, micro-influencers 10K-100K followers better ROI than mega).

Performance Measurement—Engagement Metrics: Pageviews (absolute traffic, vanity metric without context, trending up/down over time matters), time on page (quality signal, 2-3 minutes average good for 1500-word article, <30 seconds bounce likely), scroll depth (% of users reach 25%/50%/75%/100% page, identify drop-off points, optimize content improving retention), social shares (virality indicator, 100+ shares on 1000-pageview article excellent 10% ratio, share buttons reduce friction). SEO Performance: Organic traffic (Google Search Console, query rankings, CTR optimization, position tracking, takes 3-6 months to mature for competitive keywords), keyword rankings (track primary/secondary keywords, position 1-3 vast majority of clicks, position 4-10 incremental gains, page 2+ invisible), backlinks (quality domains linking to article, Ahrefs/Moz metrics, editorial links most valuable, disavow spammy links), domain authority (Moz DA site-wide metric, higher DA sites rank easier, takes years to build, article quality compounds). Conversion Metrics: Email subscribers (lead gen CTA, 1-5% conversion rate landing pages, 0.5-2% in-article, grow email list core asset), leads/demos (B2B content marketing, qualified leads to sales, attribute revenue to content, 30-60 day lag typical), affiliate revenue (product recommendations, Amazon Associates 1-3%, software SaaS 20-40%, disclose affiliate relationship FTC), engagement actions (comments, form submissions, tool downloads, newsletter referrals, community joining).

### Example 2: Lifestyle Magazine Feature Article
**Prompt:** Write 3,500-word feature article about "Minimalism Movement's Impact on Mental Health" for Psychology Today, 35-55 age female-skewed audience, narrative storytelling with expert interviews, $1/word freelance rate $3,500.

**Output:** Pitch and Assignment—Query letter: Personal connection (author's own minimalism journey 5-year arc), unique angle (focus on psychological mechanisms not just decluttering tips, interview leading psychologists + neuroscientists), timeliness (Netflix documentary wave, pandemic-driven reevaluation of possessions, 2024 trend data). Editor response: Assignment 3,500 words, 6-week deadline, $1/word $3,500 payment, 3 rounds revisions included, byline + headshot, rights first North American serial print + digital. Research Phase—Interviews: 5 expert sources (clinical psychologist specializing in anxiety/OCD, consumer behavior researcher, neuroscientist studying decision fatigue, minimalism author, maximalist interior designer for counterpoint), 1 hour each recorded/transcribed, pull quotes 2-3 sentences each, diversity of perspectives. Literature review: 15 academic papers (Psychological Science, Journal of Consumer Research, personality research on materialism), 8 books (Marie Kondo, Fumio Sasaki, psychology of possessions), 25 articles (New York Times, Atlantic, existing Psychology Today coverage). Protagonist research: 3 individuals profiled (Sarah 42 former marketing exec now minimalist, Michael 38 struggled with compulsive buying, Emma 29 chose minimalism after burnout), phone interviews 90 minutes, visit homes photograph, follow-up questions, permission signed releases. Article Structure—Narrative Lede: Scene-setting (Sarah standing in 400-sq-ft apartment, everything she owns fits in 2 suitcases, contrast to former 2,500-sq-ft house crammed with possessions), sensory details (light streaming, clean surfaces, single plant, silence absence of stuff), emotional beat (relief not deprivation, liberation not sacrifice), 350 words immersive opening. Nut Graf: Thesis (minimalism more than aesthetic trend, psychological movement addressing modern overwhelm, research emerging on mental health impacts), stakes (Americans own 300,000 items average, decision fatigue epidemic, clutter-anxiety correlation), promise (article explores psychological mechanisms, expert insights, real transformation stories, evidence-based understanding), 200 words roadmap. Body Arc—Act 1 Problem (600 words): Consumer culture and psychological burden (advertising exposure 5,000 messages daily, social comparison via social media, keeping up with Joneses digitally amplified), expert quote clinical psychologist (materialism correlation with depression/anxiety research findings), protagonist story Sarah's former life (shopping addiction, credit card debt, apartment overflowing, underlying anxiety self-medicating via acquisition). Act 2 Solution (1,200 words): Minimalism psychology (decision fatigue reduction fewer choices, visual clarity decluttered space calmer mind, identity shift from having to being, control and agency intentional living), neuroscience evidence (prefrontal cortex conservation, cortisol reduction studies, fMRI scans cluttered vs minimal environments), process challenges (attachment to possessions, sunk cost fallacy, social pressure, grief over discarding memory objects), expert quote consumer researcher (possessions externalized self, minimalism scary identity stripping, gradual approach sustainable), protagonist story Michael's journey (compulsive buying childhood scarcity compensation, therapy + minimalism combined approach, setbacks relapses, 3-year process). Act 3 Transformation (800 words): Mental health outcomes (Sarah's anxiety medication reduction doctor-supervised, Michael's mindfulness practice deepened, Emma's burnout recovery clarity restored), counterpoint maximalist designer (joy in collections, minimalism not universal answer, cultural bias Western privileged, some personalities thrive in abundance), expert quote psychologist (minimalism tool not panacea, works for specific personalities, combine with therapy for underlying issues, beware extreme all-or-nothing thinking new obsession). Conclusion (350 words): Synthesis (minimalism continuum not binary, psychological benefits real for many but not prescriptive, addressing root causes matters more than item count), Sarah closing scene (hiking trip no possessions, presence moment, mental space former clutter occupied, contentment hard-won), thematic resonance (enough is abundance shifted definition, internal richness vs external accumulation). Sidebar Boxes—"Is Minimalism Right for You?" quiz (10 questions assess personality fit, scoring interpretation), "How to Start: 5 Steps from Psychologists" (actionable beginner framework), "The Science Behind Clutter and Anxiety" (research summary infographic text). Writing Craft—Tone: Empathetic storytelling (non-judgmental both minimalists and non, humanize struggles, avoid preaching or trend evangelism), narrative techniques (scene-setting immersive, dialogue snippets conversational, internal thoughts Sarah/Michael/Emma intimate first-person blended third-person narration), voice: Literary magazine (sophisticated prose without purple, metaphor grounded not flowery, pacing alternates action/reflection slow-fast rhythm).

### Example 3: News Article (Breaking Tech Story)
**Prompt:** Write 600-word news article about "Major Tech Company Data Breach" for TechCrunch, tech-savvy 25-45 audience, objective tone, inverted pyramid structure, 4-hour deadline research-to-publish.

**Output:** Breaking News Context—Initial report: Company press release issued 2pm, confirms breach, vague details ("unauthorized access to systems", "investigating"), no user count disclosed, stock drops 8% after-hours, competitors silent. Reporter assignment: 4-hour deadline for 6pm publish (traffic peak, beat competitors), confirm facts, find additional sources, assess impact, 600 words tight. Research Sprint—Source 1 Press Release (official statement, facts: breach discovered Dec 10, third-party accessed customer names/emails, no financial data credit cards/SSNs compromised they claim, notifying users via email 72 hours, offering free credit monitoring 1 year, external cybersecurity firm investigating, quotes CEO apology + CTO technical summary). Source 2 Cybersecurity Expert (cold email 5 cybersecurity experts, 2 respond within 30 min, phone interview 15 min, quote on breach severity, industry context similar breaches frequency, advice for users, expert credibility established company/title). Source 3 Company Insider (anonymous source engineering team, confirms breach larger than press release implies, 50M users affected not disclosed, vulnerability known internally 6 months not patched, internal chaos legal/PR conflict, background/not for attribution protect source). Source 4 Regulatory (FTC spokesperson, template statement investigating, GDPR implications if EU users, prior enforcement actions, potential fines $X per user, phone call 10 min). Inverted Pyramid Structure—Lede (150 words): Most important facts (who: Company name, what: data breach customer names/emails, when: discovered Dec 10, where: global cloud infrastructure, why: under investigation, how: unauthorized access exploiting vulnerability), impact (50M users estimated anonymous source, financial data not believed compromised, company claims limited scope), context (latest in series tech breaches 2024, regulatory scrutiny increasing, stock impact -8%). Nut Graf (100 words): Significance (trust erosion for company valued at $X billion, competitive landscape rivals may benefit, regulatory penalties potential, user privacy implications), company response (press release promises free monitoring, external investigation, timeline for user notification), reporter assessment (discrepancy between official statement and internal source suggests scope minimization, additional reporting ongoing). Body Details (250 words): Company statement expanded (CEO quote full "We deeply regret any inconvenience caused to our valued customers and are committed to transparency throughout this process", CTO technical quote on vulnerability patched now, user notification process email + in-app), expert analysis quote ("This appears to be a SQL injection attack, a common but preventable vulnerability. The fact that it wasn't patched despite internal knowledge is concerning from a governance perspective" - named expert title), regulatory implications (GDPR Article 33 requires notification within 72 hours breach discovery, company complies but fines possible if inadequate security measures proven, precedent: $X fine similar case), user impact (no financial data exposed reduces immediate fraud risk, phishing risk elevated criminals could use names/emails for targeted attacks, advice: enable 2FA, monitor accounts, beware suspicious emails), similar breaches (context: Company A 40M users 2023, Company B 100M users 2022, increasing frequency trend). Closing (100 words): Next steps (investigation ongoing, more details expected within week, congressional inquiry possible if scope expands, company quarterly earnings report next month may address financial impact), reporter note (TechCrunch reached out to company for additional comment beyond press release, no response by publish time, will update article if received), user action (affected users check email for company notification by Dec 15, enable MFA immediately, monitor credit reports via AnnualCreditReport.com free). Writing Style—Objectivity: No opinion (neutral language, attributed all claims, "company claims X" not "company says X happened" stating as fact when disputed), balanced (company statement + expert criticism + user perspective), caveats (anonymous source labeled "could not be independently verified", "company did not respond to repeated requests for clarification"). Clarity: Jargon explained ("SQL injection attack, a method of exploiting database vulnerabilities" parenthetical definitions), short sentences (avg 12 words, news style, punchy), active voice ("Hackers accessed customer data" not "Customer data was accessed"), specificity (numbers quantified, dates exact, names/titles full first mention). AP Style: Title case headlines, Oxford comma no, state abbreviations, percent not %, numbers spell out one-nine, attribution style (said not stated, colon for full quote, comma for partial). Fact-Checking—Verification: Press release (archived PDF, direct quote, timestamp), stock price (Yahoo Finance screenshot -8.12% 4:47pm), expert credentials (LinkedIn verify, company website bio, quoted before in WSJ), regulatory precedent (FTC website case lookup, GDPR text Article 33 confirmed, fine amounts EUR calculated to USD). Corrections Protocol: If company provides conflicting info post-publish, update article with timestamp ("Updated Dec 14, 6:47pm: Company spokesperson clarified..."), strike-through old info transparency not delete, correction note top of article if material error. Legal Review: Libel risk (all defamatory claims attributed not stated as fact, "according to anonymous source" shield, public figure/company standard actual malice high bar), anonymous source (editor approval required, corroboration attempted, source motivation assessed). Publication and Updates—Initial publish: 6:02pm (missed 6pm by 2 min acceptable breaking news), headline "Company X Confirms Data Breach Affecting Millions, Stock Drops 8%" (SEO-optimized, company name for search, numbers for impact), meta description "Tech giant Company X disclosed a data breach exposing 50M users' names and emails. Here's what we know and what users should do." (158 chars). First update (6:35pm): Added company spokesperson quote received post-publish ("We want to assure users that no financial information was compromised and we are working around the clock to investigate the full scope" - Spokesperson Name), timestamp note top of article. Second update (8:15pm): Added Senator statement calling for congressional hearing (regulatory pressure angle), embedded company's blog post fuller explanation (iframe or link), updated headline "Company X Data Breach May Affect 50M Users, Congressional Hearing Likely" (evolved story). Traffic and Impact—Performance: 127K pageviews first 24 hours (breaking news spike), 1:42 avg time (short news format, readers skim), 2,400 social shares (Twitter dominant, LinkedIn secondary tech audience), 15 media outlets cited article (AP, Reuters picked up, attribution "TechCrunch first reported"), Google News top stories (Company X query, position 2 behind company press release). SEO: Ranked #1 for "Company X data breach" within 6 hours (domain authority + freshness), "Company X breach how many users" featured snippet (answered directly 50M estimate), 85K organic visits over 30 days (long tail evergreen after initial spike), 4 updates total maintained ranking refresh signal. Follow-up Stories—Day 2: "Company X Breach: What We Know Now" (roundup updating facts, user testimonials, competitor responses, 900 words), Day 7: "Inside the Company X Breach: How It Happened" (deep-dive technical analysis, interviewed forensic investigators, 2,500 words feature), Month 1: "Company X Faces $50M Fine for Data Breach" (regulatory outcome, financial impact, stock recovery analysis), Month 6: "How Company X Rebuilt Trust After Data Breach" (lessons learned, security improvements, user retention data).
