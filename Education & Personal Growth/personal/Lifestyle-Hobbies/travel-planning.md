# Travel Planning Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to plan a trip effectively across six dimensions: clarity, budget/booking, research/risk, itinerary design, logistics/tools, and flexibility/wellbeing. This produces a plan and timeline that reduces surprises.

## Template

Conduct a travel planning readiness assessment for {TRIP} with priorities {PRIORITIES} and constraints {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) CLARITY & DECISION READINESS**
- Destination/dates/duration are locked (or a decision method exists)
- Traveler preferences and non-negotiables are explicit
- Tradeoffs accepted (budget vs comfort, pace vs depth, cities vs nature)

**2) BUDGET & BOOKING READINESS**
- Realistic total budget and allocation (lodging/transport/food/activities/buffer)
- Booking windows understood (flights, lodging, timed-entry activities)
- Payment and cancellation strategy (refundable vs non-refundable)

**3) DESTINATION RESEARCH & RISK**
- Entry requirements (passport validity, visas, vaccinations) understood
- Safety, scams, and neighborhood considerations researched
- Insurance and contingency thinking (medical, cancellations, disruptions)

**4) ITINERARY DESIGN (PACE + GEOGRAPHY)**
- Geographic clustering to reduce transit friction
- Daily structure that avoids over-scheduling (one anchor + flexible blocks)
- Rest and recovery planned (especially for kids/jet lag)

**5) LOGISTICS & TOOLS**
- Transportation plan (airport transfers, local transit, car needs)
- Reservation organization (confirmations, offline access, shared docs)
- Packing/gear readiness aligned to weather and activities

**6) FLEXIBILITY & WELLBEING**
- “Must-do” vs “nice-to-do” is separated
- Backup plans exist for weather, closures, low energy
- Communication and expectations aligned among travelers

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities before booking / before departure

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary constraint

3) **TRIP COMPONENT READINESS**
- Flights/transport, lodging, activities, food, documentation, safety
- For each: status (Ready / Needs work), risks, next step

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency
- Each gap: symptom → likely cause → corrective action

5) **ROADMAP (NOW → DEPARTURE)**
- Week-by-week or milestone timeline
- Booking order and decision points
- “Itinerary skeleton” (daily anchor + flexible blocks)

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs targets for: bookings confirmed, budget variance, daily transit time, stress level, flexibility preserved

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, high risk of surprises)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (partial plan, major gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid plan, manageable risks)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (well-organized, flexible and resilient)
- 5.0: Optimized (repeatable travel system, consistently great trips)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {TRIP} | Destination + duration + travelers + dates | “7 days in Lisbon for a couple in May” |
| {PRIORITIES} | Style and priorities | “Food + culture, slow pace, photogenic neighborhoods” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Budget and constraints | “$2,500 total, no car, one traveler has knee limits” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {TRIP}: 7 days in Lisbon for a couple, mid-May
- {PRIORITIES}: Food + culture + day trips; one major activity per day; evenings relaxed
- {CONSTRAINTS}: $2,500 total; no rental car; one traveler has mild knee pain; prefers walkable neighborhoods

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.6/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities: (1) lock lodging neighborhood + cancellation terms, (2) set realistic budget allocation + buffer, (3) build a low-stairs itinerary plan

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary constraint |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Clarity & Decision Readiness | 4.0 | Dates and style are clear | Knee limits affect pace |
| Budget & Booking Readiness | 3.0 | Total budget known | Allocation not defined |
| Research & Risk | 3.5 | Basic safety/entry research done | No insurance decision |
| Itinerary Design | 4.0 | One anchor/day approach | Hilliness of Lisbon |
| Logistics & Tools | 3.5 | Transit-first is fine | Reservations organization missing |
| Flexibility & Wellbeing | 3.5 | Relaxed evenings planned | Backup options not chosen |

3) **TRIP COMPONENT READINESS**
- Lodging: Needs work — pick a flat-ish, central base; next step: shortlist 2 neighborhoods + 3 stays each
- Activities: Ready — 1 anchor/day; next step: reserve 2 timed-entry items if needed
- Transport: Ready — metro/trams + ride shares; next step: plan airport transfer and 2 day-trip routes
- Documentation: Ready — passport validity check; next step: store digital copies offline
- Safety: Needs work — stair/hill mitigation; next step: choose “low stairs” routes + rest stops

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Budget drift → no category caps → set daily caps + 10–15% buffer
- Gap 2: Mobility fatigue → itinerary ignores terrain → cluster by neighborhood; use transit up hills
- Gap 3: Reservation chaos → confirmations scattered → one shared doc + offline folder
- Gap 4: Day-trip friction → unclear booking plan → pick 1 guided day trip + 1 self-guided
- Gap 5: Weather/closure surprises → no alternates → choose 2 indoor backups

5) **ROADMAP (NOW → DEPARTURE)**
- T-6–4 weeks: lock lodging; decide insurance; rough itinerary skeleton by neighborhoods
- T-4–2 weeks: book day trips/timed entries; restaurant shortlist; transit cards/apps
- T-2–0 weeks: finalize confirmations folder; packing list; offline maps; cash/credit plan

Itinerary skeleton example:
- Morning: one anchor (museum/food tour/day trip)
- Afternoon: flexible neighborhood wandering + rest
- Evening: reserved dinner every other day; otherwise spontaneous

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Bookings confirmed: 0% → 100% by T-2 weeks
- Budget variance: unknown → within +10%
- Daily transit time: unknown → ≤60 min/day average
- Stress (self-rated): 6/10 → ≤4/10
- Flexibility: ≥30% of trip time unbooked

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Decide the trip “shape” first** — pace and base matter more than attractions.
2) **Use one anchor per day** — everything else stays flexible.
3) **Cluster geographically** — reduce transit to increase enjoyment.
4) **Budget with a buffer** — plan categories + 10–15% contingency.
5) **Book in the right order** — flights/lodging first, then timed-entry, then restaurants.
6) **Organize confirmations offline** — assume you’ll lose connectivity at the worst time.
7) **Plan for constraints explicitly** — mobility, kids, jet lag, diet, weather.
8) **Create two backup days** — indoor options and low-effort alternates prevent spiral.
