# Precision Agriculture Framework Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to implement precision agriculture capabilities: sensing, variable-rate application, decision support, and operational governance.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess precision agriculture readiness for farm/operation [OPERATION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategy & ROI, (2) Data & sensing, (3) Equipment & interoperability, (4) Decision workflows, (5) Operations & training, (6) Governance & scaling. Provide a scorecard and a rollout roadmap.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategy & ROI
- 1 — Initial: No clear value case; goals undefined.
- 3 — Defined: Use cases prioritized with ROI assumptions and constraints.
- 5 — Optimized: ROI is measured and optimized; scaling decisions are data-driven.

### 2) Data & Sensing
- 1 — Initial: Sensors/data streams missing or unreliable.
- 3 — Defined: Core sensing and data capture defined; QA processes exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted, timely, and supports automation and learning.

### 3) Equipment & Interoperability
- 1 — Initial: Equipment data is siloed; integration difficult.
- 3 — Defined: Key systems integrate; standards and interfaces documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Interoperability is reliable; upgrades do not break workflows.

### 4) Decision Workflows
- 1 — Initial: Decisions are manual; recommendations inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Decision cadence and roles defined; DSS outputs used.
- 5 — Optimized: Workflows are optimized; decisions are repeatable and auditable.

### 5) Operations & Training
- 1 — Initial: Operators untrained; change adoption low.
- 3 — Defined: Training and SOPs exist; support model defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Operations are mature; adoption is high and sustained.

### 6) Governance & Scaling
- 1 — Initial: No ownership; pilots don’t scale.
- 3 — Defined: Governance model and rollout plan; metrics tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Scaling is systematic across fields/sites with consistent standards.

## Deliverables
- Precision agriculture readiness scorecard
- Use-case portfolio and ROI model
- Data/sensing and integration architecture
- Operating model (roles, cadence, SOPs)
- Rollout roadmap with training plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [OPERATION]: Farm/operation
- [USE_CASES]: Priority use cases
- [EQUIPMENT]: Equipment stack
- [DATA_SOURCES]: Data sources
- [ROI_MODEL]: ROI assumptions
- [ROLLOUT]: Rollout stages

## Example (Condensed)
- Operation: 10k-acre mixed crop farm
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 2; Data 2; Interop 2; Workflows 3; Ops 2; Governance 2
- 90-day priorities: Define ROI use cases; stabilize data capture; standardize equipment interfaces; create training and governance
