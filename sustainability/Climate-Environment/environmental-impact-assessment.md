# Environmental Impact Assessment & Management Template

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive environmental impact assessment, manage environmental compliance, reduce pollution and resource consumption, protect biodiversity, implement environmental management systems, and demonstrate environmental stewardship beyond climate.

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example
```
Company: Manufacturing (10 facilities)
Environmental Priorities:
1. Water: 250,000 m³/year (2 facilities in high water-stress) → Target -30% by 2030
2. Waste: 3,500 tonnes/year (62% diversion) → Target 90% by 2028 (near-zero landfill)
3. Air quality: VOC emissions 18 tonnes/year → Target -50% by 2027
4. Biodiversity: 1 facility near protected wetland → No-net-loss policy

Management:
- ISO 14001 certified (8 of 10 facilities, target 100% by 2026)
- Environmental incidents: 2 minor spills (2024) → Target zero
- Compliance: 100% permit compliance, zero violations
- Investment: $12M (water efficiency, waste infrastructure, pollution controls)

Quick Wins: LED lighting, water recycling pilots, waste segregation improvement
```

### When to Use This
- Managing environmental compliance and permits
- Reducing environmental footprint (water, waste, pollution)
- Addressing stakeholder concerns (communities, NGOs)
- Implementing ISO 14001 or similar EMS
- Supporting ESG strategy beyond climate

### Basic 4-Step Workflow
1. **Baseline Assessment** - Measure water, waste, air, biodiversity impacts (3-4 weeks)
2. **Regulatory & Risk Review** - Identify compliance requirements and risks (2-3 weeks)
3. **Target & Program Development** - Set targets, design reduction programs (4-6 weeks)
4. **Implementation & Monitoring** - Execute initiatives, track performance (ongoing)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Manufacturing - Water-Intensive
```
Company: Chemicals manufacturing (water-intensive)
Priorities: Water (500K m³/year in high-stress region), waste (hazardous), VOCs
Targets: -40% water by 2030, 95% waste diversion, -60% VOCs
Investment: $18M (water recycling, waste infrastructure, emission controls)
Result: Reduced water risk, near-zero waste, cleaner air
```

### Example 2: Retail - Waste Focus
```
Company: 500-store retailer
Priorities: Store waste (plastic, cardboard), product packaging
Targets: 90% waste diversion stores, 50% sustainable packaging suppliers
Initiatives: Recycling programs all stores, supplier requirements, product design
Result: 85% diversion achieved (2024), on track for 90%
```

### Example 3: Technology - E-Waste
```
Company: Electronics manufacturer
Priorities: E-waste (product take-back), water (manufacturing), biodiversity (supply chain)
Targets: Take-back 25% of products sold, water recycling 50%, zero deforestation
Initiatives: Customer take-back program, water reuse systems, sustainable sourcing
Result: Growing circular economy, lower environmental footprint
```

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive baseline** - Measure all material environmental impacts
2. **Site-specific** - Different facilities have different priorities
3. **Regulatory first** - Compliance is foundation
4. **Circular thinking** - Waste as resource, closed-loop systems
5. **Stakeholder engagement** - Community concerns matter

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Climate-only focus** - Ignoring water, waste, biodiversity
✅ Instead: Holistic environmental management (all impacts)

❌ **No water strategy** - Underestimating water scarcity risk
✅ Instead: Water risk assessment, reduction targets esp. high-stress areas

❌ **Linear waste model** - Just landfilling waste
✅ Instead: Circular economy, zero waste ambitions

❌ **Ignoring biodiversity** - No nature considerations
✅ Instead: Assess biodiversity impacts, no-net-loss commitments

## Environmental Management Checklist

- [ ] Baseline environmental impacts (water, waste, air, biodiversity)
- [ ] Regulatory compliance review
- [ ] Environmental targets set
- [ ] Reduction initiatives designed
- [ ] ISO 14001 or EMS implemented
- [ ] Monitoring systems operational
