# Lead Scoring Framework & Methodology

## Purpose
Establish the strategic foundation for your lead scoring system by defining your ideal customer profile, scoring methodology, and business context.

## Template

```
As a [MARKETING_PROFESSIONAL_ROLE] with [CERTIFICATION_TYPE] working at [COMPANY_TYPE] with [YEARS_EXPERIENCE] years of experience, I am developing a lead scoring system for [TARGET_MARKET] focusing on [PRIMARY_PRODUCT_SERVICE] with [SALES_CYCLE_LENGTH] sales cycle.

Business Context:
- Company size: [COMPANY_SIZE_EMPLOYEES] employees, [ANNUAL_REVENUE] annual revenue

- Geographic coverage: [PRIMARY_MARKET], [SECONDARY_MARKETS]
- Sales model: [SALES_MODEL_TYPE] (B2B/B2C/B2B2C)
- Average deal size: $[AVERAGE_DEAL_SIZE]
- Sales cycle length: [SALES_CYCLE_DURATION] days average

Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):
- Company size: [ICP_COMPANY_SIZE_RANGE] employees

Scoring Methodology: [SCORING_METHOD_TYPE]
- Scoring scale: [SCORING_SCALE_RANGE] (e.g., 0-100)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Data**: Analyze historical conversion data before building models
2. **Align Teams**: Ensure sales and marketing agree on ICP and definitions
3. **Keep It Simple**: Start with basic scoring and add complexity over time
4. **Test Hypotheses**: Validate assumptions with data before implementing
5. **Document Everything**: Create clear documentation of scoring logic
6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit framework quarterly to ensure relevance
7. **Consider Context**: Account for industry, business model, and market dynamics
8. **Plan for Scale**: Design framework to accommodate growth and change

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Over-complicating initial model
- Ignoring negative scoring factors
- Not involving sales team in definition
- Failing to account for data quality issues
- Setting thresholds without historical analysis
- Neglecting to plan for model updates
- Missing integration requirements
- Overlooking compliance and privacy

## Next Steps

After establishing your framework:
1. → **Define Criteria**: Build detailed scoring rules ([lead-scoring-criteria.md](lead-scoring-criteria.md))
2. → **Plan Implementation**: Design system architecture ([lead-scoring-implementation.md](lead-scoring-implementation.md))
3. → **Set Up Automation**: Configure workflows ([lead-scoring-automation.md](lead-scoring-automation.md))
4. → **Establish Measurement**: Define analytics ([lead-scoring-optimization.md](lead-scoring-optimization.md))
