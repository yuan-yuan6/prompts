# Student Engagement Strategy Designer

## Purpose
Design comprehensive engagement strategies that motivate students, promote active participation, build learning communities, and sustain involvement throughout the course.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: Strategies to increase student participation and motivation

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and delivery mode
- Student profile (level, motivation, size)
- Current engagement challenges (low attendance, minimal discussion)
- Priority areas (active learning, discussion, collaboration)

**5-minute starter**:
1. Identify your biggest engagement problem (students don't attend? Don't prepare? Don't participate?)
2. Consider WHY (not motivated? Too hard? Not relevant? No accountability?)
3. Choose ONE strategy to try immediately (think-pair-share, entrance tickets, choice in assignments)
4. Plan how you'll introduce it and explain the benefit to students
5. Decide how you'll know if it's working (participation rates, quality of responses)

**Common first use**: "Design engagement strategies for 'Introduction to Biology' - 250 students, required course, twice-weekly lectures. Challenges: students don't attend, use phones in class, don't do readings. Want active learning during lecture, better preparation, peer interaction. Have clicker system and TAs available."

**Expected output**: Comprehensive engagement strategy based on motivation theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness), diverse active learning methods for in-person and online contexts, community-building techniques, participation strategies, systems to sustain engagement and prevent mid-semester slump, re-engagement approaches for struggling students, and evaluation metrics.

**Best for**: Improving low-participation courses, engaging required courses, online community building, replacing passive lectures with active learning, designing discussions, sustaining motivation.
