# Risk Management Program Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to run a coherent risk management program across governance, core risk domains, compliance obligations, and emerging-risk capabilities.

## Quick Prompt
Assess risk management program readiness for [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME] with [TOTAL_ASSETS] assets. Score readiness across governance, core risk domain coverage, measurement and reporting, controls and remediation, compliance/exam readiness, and innovation/emerging risks. Provide scores (1–5), key gaps, and the next 3 improvements.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Governance & Risk Appetite
- 1: Decision rights and appetite are unclear.
- 3: Appetite exists; escalation paths are partial.
- 5: Governance, limits, and escalation are consistent and enforced.

2) Domain Coverage (Credit, Market, Operational, Liquidity)
- 1: Coverage is fragmented and inconsistent.
- 3: Coverage exists for major risks; gaps remain.
- 5: Clear ownership and complete coverage across domains.

3) Measurement, Scenarios & Stress Testing
- 1: Metrics are inconsistent; scenarios are sporadic.
- 3: Standard scenarios exist for major cycles.
- 5: Validated metrics and decision-linked scenarios are standard.

4) Controls, Issues & Remediation Execution
- 1: Control testing is inconsistent; remediation is slow.
- 3: Control programs exist; tracking is uneven.
- 5: Issue management, remediation tracking, and closure evidence are standard.

5) Compliance, Reporting & Exam Readiness
- 1: Evidence and reporting are scattered.
- 3: Standard reports exist; readiness varies.
- 5: Evidence library, reporting calendar, and playbooks are consistent.

6) Emerging Risks & Innovation Governance
- 1: Emerging risks are informal; innovation is unmanaged.
- 3: Initial governance exists for high-risk areas.
- 5: Owned workstreams with controls, monitoring, and escalation.

## Deliverables
- Program map (governance, risk owners, reporting calendar)
- Risk appetite and limit framework (with triggers)
- Domain packs (credit, market/ALM, operational/cyber, liquidity)
- Compliance and exam readiness pack (evidence library, playbooks)
- Remediation tracker (issues, owners, dates, closure evidence)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — fragmented risk management.
- Level 2: Documented — policies exist; enforcement varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard governance and reporting for major risks.
- Level 4: Managed — validated metrics, triggers, and remediation discipline.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from outcomes and incidents.

## Variables
- [FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION_NAME]
- [INSTITUTION_TYPE]
- [TOTAL_ASSETS]
- [REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS]
- [RISK_APPETITE]
- [SCENARIOS]
- [KRIS]
- [EMERGING_RISKS]

## Example (Condensed)
Mid-size bank preparing for a major regulatory exam.
- Start: governance and appetite refresh, evidence library, and remediation tracker.
- Next: standard domain packs (credit, ALM, liquidity, cyber) with cadence.
- Outcome: consistent reporting and clear triggers for management actions.
