# Debt Management Template

## Purpose
Develop effective debt reduction strategies, consolidation plans, and negotiation approaches to eliminate debt efficiently while minimizing interest costs and improving credit scores for long-term financial health.

## Quick Start

Begin eliminating debt in three focused steps:

1. **List All Your Debts**
   - Create a debt inventory: creditor, balance, interest rate, minimum payment, due date
   - Calculate total debt and total monthly payments
   - Identify your highest interest rate debt (usually credit cards 15-25%)
   - Example: Credit Card 1: $5,000 @ 22%, $150/month; Student Loan: $25,000 @ 6%, $300/month

2. **Choose Your Payoff Method**
   - Avalanche (save most money): Attack highest interest rate first
   - Snowball (fastest wins): Pay off smallest balance first for motivation
   - Find extra $50-200/month: cut subscriptions, side hustle, expense reduction
   - Put all extra money toward target debt while paying minimums on others

3. **Take Immediate Action** (this week)
   - Call creditors to negotiate lower interest rates (ask for supervisor if declined)
   - Set up automatic payments to avoid late fees
   - Transfer high-interest debt to 0% balance transfer card if credit allows
   - Sign up for Credit Karma to monitor credit score monthly (free)

**Debt Freedom Template**: "Total debt: `[AMOUNT]` across `[NUMBER]` accounts. Highest rate: `[RATE]` on `[CREDITOR]`. I'll use `[METHOD]` method. Extra monthly payment: `[AMOUNT]`. Target debt-free date: `[DATE]` (typically 2-5 years). First action: `[IMMEDIATE_STEP]`."
