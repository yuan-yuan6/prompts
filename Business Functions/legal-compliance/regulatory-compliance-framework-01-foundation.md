# Regulatory Compliance Framework - Part 1: Foundation & Governance

## Purpose
Establish the foundational elements of a comprehensive compliance program including governance structures, organizational design, policy frameworks, compliance culture development, and basic risk assessment principles.

## Quick Start

Get started with your compliance foundation in three simple steps:

1. **Define Governance Structure** - Establish board oversight, executive leadership roles, and three lines of defense model
2. **Develop Core Policies** - Create policy management system and standard operating procedures
3. **Build Compliance Culture** - Design culture assessment and change management programs

**Time to complete:** 4-6 weeks for initial framework
**Output:** Governance charter, policy framework, culture strategy

## What's Covered in This Part

✓ Executive summary and strategic approach
✓ Governance structure and organizational design
✓ Policy and procedure management systems
✓ Compliance culture development
✓ Foundational risk assessment concepts

## What's in Other Parts

→ **Part 2 (Risk Management & Monitoring):** Comprehensive risk assessment, monitoring systems, regulatory change management, training programs
→ **Part 3 (Implementation & Reporting):** Audit framework, regulatory relationships, performance measurement, implementation timeline
