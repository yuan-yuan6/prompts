# Brand Strategy & Identity Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to develop and implement a brand strategy and identity system: positioning, messaging architecture, visual identity, activation, and governance.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess brand strategy readiness for [BRAND_NAME] targeting [TARGET_SEGMENTS] with goals [BRAND_AWARENESS]% awareness and [MARKET_SHARE]% share. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategic clarity & positioning, (2) Customer/audience insight, (3) Identity & messaging system, (4) Activation & channel implementation, (5) Governance & enablement, (6) Measurement & iteration. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategic Clarity & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: Purpose and positioning unclear; differentiation weak.
- 3 — Defined: Positioning statement, value proposition, and differentiation are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Positioning is defended with proof; decisions are consistent; strategy scales.

### 2) Customer/Audience Insight
- 1 — Initial: Limited research; assumptions drive decisions.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and segments; needs and objections mapped; competitive context understood.
- 5 — Optimized: Insight pipeline exists; segmentation is operationalized and refreshed.

### 3) Identity & Messaging System
- 1 — Initial: Visual identity and messaging inconsistent; assets scattered.
- 3 — Defined: Identity guidelines, voice/tone, and messaging architecture; templates exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular system scales across channels; quality is maintained with governance.

### 4) Activation & Channel Implementation
- 1 — Initial: Rollout plan unclear; channel execution inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Activation plan by channel; message-match maintained; content plan exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Orchestrated activation; sequencing by funnel stage; learnings drive iteration.

### 5) Governance & Enablement
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; approvals subjective; training absent.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights; review workflow; enablement materials.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance enables speed; teams self-serve; drift is monitored.

### 6) Measurement & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: Measurement sporadic; no feedback loop.
- 3 — Defined: Brand health KPIs with cadence; reporting and action tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement ties to business outcomes; iteration is continuous and controlled.

## Deliverables
- Brand strategy readiness scorecard and top gaps
- Positioning and messaging architecture (pillars, proof, CTAs)
- Identity system outline (visual, voice, templates)
- Activation plan (channels, sequencing, content)
- Governance and measurement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [TARGET_SEGMENTS]: Target segments
- [BRAND_AWARENESS]: Awareness target
- [MARKET_SHARE]: Market share target
- [CHANNEL_COUNT]: Channel count
- [REVENUE_IMPACT]: Revenue impact

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Retail challenger brand entering a new market
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Insight 2; System 2; Activation 2; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Limited research; weak templates; unclear rollout and governance
- 90-day priorities: Run insight sprint; define positioning + messaging; create identity system + governance; set KPI cadence
