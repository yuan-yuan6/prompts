# Comprehensive Landing Pages Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to build and optimize landing pages at scale, including copy/UX, performance, tracking, governance, and experimentation.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess comprehensive landing page readiness for [BRAND_COMPANY] launching [CAMPAIGN_NAME] from [TRAFFIC_SOURCE] with goal [PRIMARY_OBJECTIVE] and target [TARGET_CONVERSION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Offer clarity & message-match, (2) UX & information architecture, (3) Proof/objections & persuasion system, (4) Performance & analytics instrumentation, (5) Experimentation & optimization program, (6) Compliance, accessibility & governance. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Offer Clarity & Message-Match
- 1 — Initial: Offer and promise are unclear; mismatch between ads and page; unclear audience intent.
- 3 — Defined: Clear value proposition and conversion ask; message-match checked across touchpoints.
- 5 — Optimized: Offer segmentation is intentional; message-match is audited continuously; funnel coherence is maintained.

### 2) UX & Information Architecture
- 1 — Initial: Layout is confusing; mobile experience weak; friction points unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Mobile-first design; scannable structure; form friction minimized; clear CTAs.
- 5 — Optimized: UX is tuned based on behavioral data; components are modular; accessibility is built-in.

### 3) Proof/Objections & Persuasion System
- 1 — Initial: Claims lack proof; trust elements are missing; objections unaddressed.
- 3 — Defined: Proof library exists; objection handling incorporated; persuasion elements are consistent.
- 5 — Optimized: Proof and objections are targeted by segment; credibility is maintained; persuasion is improved through testing.

### 4) Performance & Analytics Instrumentation
- 1 — Initial: Page speed issues; tracking unreliable; conversion events unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Performance targets; event schema; tracking QA; dashboards exist.
- 5 — Optimized: Monitoring and alerting; data quality routines; instrumentation supports rapid iteration.

### 5) Experimentation & Optimization Program
- 1 — Initial: Changes are subjective; no cadence; learnings aren’t stored.
- 3 — Defined: Hypothesis backlog; test cadence; analysis standards; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Programmatic experimentation; component-level learnings reused; optimization ties to business outcomes.

### 6) Compliance, Accessibility & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Disclosures inconsistent; approvals slow; accessibility ignored.
- 3 — Defined: Compliance/a11y checklists; ownership; review workflow.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance embedded; updates are safe and fast; audits are possible without rework.

## Deliverables
- Program readiness scorecard with prioritized gap list
- Landing page brief standard and reusable component plan
- Analytics instrumentation plan (events, QA, dashboards)
- Performance targets and monitoring approach
- Experimentation operating model and learnings repository
- 90-day roadmap

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_COMPANY]: Brand/company
- [CAMPAIGN_NAME]: Campaign name
- [TRAFFIC_SOURCE]: Traffic source and intent
- [PRIMARY_OBJECTIVE]: Conversion goal
- [TARGET_CONVERSION]: Target conversion rate
- [SOCIAL_PROOF_ELEMENTS]: Proof types available

## Example (Condensed)
- Company: B2B SaaS running multi-landing-page acquisition
- Scores (1–5): Offer 3; UX 3; Proof 2; Instrumentation 2; Experimentation 2; Governance 3
- Top gaps: Tracking QA gaps; weak proof system; inconsistent experimentation methods
- 90-day priorities: Standardize event schema + QA; build proof/objection library; establish test cadence and learnings repository
