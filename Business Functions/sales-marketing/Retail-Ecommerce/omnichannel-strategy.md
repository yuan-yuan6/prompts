# Omnichannel Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver a consistent omnichannel experience across marketing, commerce, fulfillment, and service with aligned operations and measurement.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess omnichannel readiness for [BUSINESS] across [CHANNELS] with goal [NPS_TARGET] NPS and [NRR_TARGET] retention. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Journey & experience design, (2) Channel consistency, (3) Inventory/fulfillment orchestration, (4) Data & systems, (5) Operating model & governance, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Journey & Experience Design
- 1 — Initial: Journeys are not mapped; experience varies widely by channel.
- 3 — Defined: Core journeys mapped; standards and owners defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Journeys are operationalized; friction is measured and reduced continuously.

### 2) Channel Consistency
- 1 — Initial: Messaging and policies differ by channel; customer confusion is common.
- 3 — Defined: Policy and content standards; consistent offers and messaging.
- 5 — Optimized: Consistency is monitored; updates roll out reliably across channels.

### 3) Inventory/Fulfillment Orchestration
- 1 — Initial: Inventory is siloed; fulfillment choices are limited.
- 3 — Defined: Allocation rules; ship-from-store/pickup options defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Orchestration optimizes cost and service level; exceptions are managed.

### 4) Data & Systems
- 1 — Initial: Customer and order data is fragmented; reporting inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Core integrations (OMS/WMS/CRM); shared customer view improving.
- 5 — Optimized: Data is trusted and near-real-time; personalization and service improve.

### 5) Operating Model & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Ownership unclear; cross-channel decisions are slow.
- 3 — Defined: Decision rights and cadence; cross-functional coordination.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales; governance enables fast, consistent changes.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: KPIs differ by channel; no end-to-end view.
- 3 — Defined: Unified KPIs and dashboards; optimization cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Optimization ties to business outcomes; improvements compound.

## Deliverables
- Omnichannel readiness scorecard and gap list
- Journey map and experience standards by touchpoint
- Inventory and fulfillment orchestration rules
- Data/system integration priorities
- Unified KPI framework and governance cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BUSINESS]: Business name
- [CHANNELS]: Stores, DTC, marketplaces, social
- [NPS_TARGET]: NPS/CSAT target
- [NRR_TARGET]: Retention target
- [OMS_WMS]: Order/Warehouse systems
- [CX_METRICS]: Delivery time, returns, contact rate

## Example (Condensed)
- Business: Retailer integrating stores and online fulfillment
- Scores (1–5): Journey 2; Consistency 3; Orchestration 2; Data 2; Governance 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Map journeys; define orchestration rules; align KPIs and governance cadence
