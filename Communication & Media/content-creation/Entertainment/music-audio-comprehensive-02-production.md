# Music Production & Recording Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess a music production project's readiness for recording across six dimensions: Recording Strategy & Session Planning, Technical Infrastructure & Equipment, Performance Capture & Tracking, Sound Design & Sonic Palette, Production Workflow & Collaboration, and Quality Control & Deliverables. This framework identifies technical gaps, validates recording approach, and ensures efficient studio sessions before costly recording begins.

**Note:** This is Part 2 of a 3-part music production series. Part 1 covers Composition & Arrangement (prerequisite), Part 3 covers Mixing & Mastering (next step).

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **production readiness** for **[PROJECT_TITLE]**, a **[RECORDING_TYPE]** project at **[STUDIO_TYPE]**. Evaluate across: (1) **Recording strategy**—is the tracking approach defined (live vs overdubs), session schedule realistic, pre-production quality sufficient? What's the budget allocation? (2) **Technical infrastructure**—what's the studio capability (room acoustics, equipment quality, digital audio workstation), microphone inventory, signal flow planning? (3) **Performance capture**—how prepared are performers, is click/guide track strategy clear, are recording techniques validated? (4) **Sound design**—what's the sonic palette (instruments, synthesis, processing), effect chains planned, production aesthetic defined? (5) **Production workflow**—who owns creative decisions, is collaboration structure clear, are file organization and backup systems ready? (6) **Quality control**—what are the listening standards, technical deliverable specs, revision process, handoff to mixing? Provide a maturity scorecard (1-5 per dimension), critical blockers, prioritized actions, and a session-by-session recording plan.

**Usage:** Replace bracketed placeholders with your specifics. Use as a prompt to an AI assistant for rapid production evaluation.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive production readiness assessment for {PROJECT_TITLE}, a {RECORDING_TYPE} project recording at {STUDIO_TYPE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1-5:

**1. Recording Strategy & Session Planning Readiness** — Evaluating whether the recording approach is clearly defined through decisions about live tracking entire ensemble capturing performance energy and interaction vs overdubbing building track-by-track with precision and control vs hybrid approach combining live basic tracks with overdubbed elaboration, examining whether the session schedule demonstrates realistic time allocation through adequate tracking days for material quantity and complexity, buffer time for technical issues and creative exploration, rest breaks preventing fatigue-induced performance degradation, revision and retake contingency, setup and breakdown time accounting, travel and logistics consideration, and avoiding marathon sessions compromising quality, determining whether pre-production preparation maximizes studio efficiency through production-quality demos communicating vision to all collaborators, arrangement finalization preventing mid-session rewrites, tempo and key decisions locked, guide tracks and reference recordings prepared, scratch vocals or instrumental guides recorded, chart preparation if needed for session musicians, and technical specifications documented, assessing whether budget allocation is realistic and comprehensive through studio time costs at hourly rates with multi-day discounts considered, engineer and producer fees (flat rate vs daily rate vs percentage), session musician payments and cartage fees, equipment rental beyond studio's inventory, tape or hard drive storage media, catering and hospitality for long sessions, accommodation if traveling to studio, and 15-20% contingency buffer for inevitable overages, verifying whether creative roles and decision-making authority are clearly defined through producer's involvement level (executive vs hands-on vs co-producer), artist's creative control boundaries, engineer's input on technical vs creative matters, A&R or label involvement if applicable, session musician direction authority, mix engineer consultation during tracking, and conflict resolution process when creative disagreements arise, examining whether technical specifications align with final delivery requirements through sample rate and bit depth matching mastering needs (24-bit/96kHz for maximum flexibility, 24-bit/48kHz for film/TV sync, 24-bit/44.1kHz for CD-only projects), track count and session complexity within DAW capability, plugin and processing CPU demands, file storage capacity for multitrack sessions (1GB+ per song at high resolution), format compatibility for collaboration (Pro Tools, Logic, Ableton session exchange), and future-proofing for potential remixes or stems, determining whether studio selection matches project needs through room acoustic quality for intended sound (dead room for isolation, live room for natural reverb, variety of recording spaces), technical equipment quality and maintenance, engineer experience with genre and techniques, location convenience vs quality trade-offs, budget fit, availability for desired dates, past client references and portfolio, and backup studio contingency if primary unavailable, and assessing whether contingency planning addresses potential problems through equipment failure backup plans, performer illness or unavailability, technical issue troubleshooting resources (assistant engineer, tech support), creative block or dissatisfaction strategies, budget overrun response plans, deadline pressure management, and knowing when to pause vs push through difficulties.

**2. Technical Infrastructure & Equipment Readiness** — Assessing whether studio acoustic treatment serves recording goals through control room accuracy for monitoring decisions (absorption preventing flutter echoes, bass trapping managing low-frequency modes, diffusion creating even decay, minimal room coloration), live room characteristics matching aesthetic (bright room for energetic rock, warm room for intimate vocals, dead booth for isolated tracking, multiple rooms offering options), isolation between spaces preventing bleed, ambient noise floor low enough for quiet passages, HVAC noise management, and acoustic design validated through professional measurement or experienced ear, examining whether monitoring environment enables accurate decisions through main monitors with flat frequency response (±3dB 40Hz-16kHz minimum) and adequate SPL capability, near-field monitors for detail work, multiple playback systems testing mix translation (small speakers, consumer headphones, mono check, car stereo), room correction or calibration systems, monitoring volume consistency (reference SPL levels), and acoustic treatment supporting accurate listening, determining whether microphone inventory covers tracking needs through dynamic mics for drums and guitar amps (Shure SM57/SM58, Sennheiser MD421, Electro-Voice RE20), large-diaphragm condensers for vocals (Neumann U87, AKG C414, Audio-Technica AT4050), small-diaphragm condensers for acoustic instruments (AKG C451, Neumann KM184, Shure SM81), ribbon mics for warmth (Royer R-121, AEA R84), specialty mics for unique applications, stereo pairs for proper imaging, condition and maintenance of mic collection, and appropriate selections for planned sources, evaluating whether preamp and conversion quality maintains signal integrity through clean preamps with sufficient gain for ribbons and dynamics (60+ dB), character preamps adding tonal color (tube, transformer, solid-state flavors), analog-to-digital converters at project bit depth and sample rate, word clock distribution preventing jitter, gain staging throughout chain preventing noise or distortion, and transparency vs color choices serving aesthetic, verifying whether digital audio workstation and computer systems handle project demands through DAW selection matching workflow (Pro Tools for compatibility, Logic for composition integration, Ableton for electronic production, Studio One for efficiency), computer processing power for track count and plugin load, RAM for large sample libraries (32GB minimum for professional work), storage speed (SSD for session drives) and capacity, backup systems (RAID, redundant drives, cloud backup), session organization and template workflows, and technical troubleshooting capability, examining whether outboard gear and processing tools enable sonic goals through compressors for dynamic control (1176 for aggressive peaks, LA-2A for smooth vocals, Distressor for versatility), equalizers for tonal shaping (Pultec for color, parametric for precision, console EQs for musicality), reverbs and delays (plate reverb for vocals, spring reverb for guitars, tape delay for warmth, digital reverb for control), saturation and harmonic distortion (tape machines, tube gear, analog summing), instrument amplifiers and effects pedals, and integration with digital workflow (hybrid vs all-digital approach), determining whether instrument and amplifier selection serves production aesthetic through guitar amplifiers matching tone goals (vintage Fender for clean, Marshall for crunch, Mesa/Boogie for high-gain, modelers for versatility), bass amplifiers and direct injection options, keyboard and synthesizer inventory (analog vs digital, vintage vs modern), acoustic instruments condition and tuning, drum kit quality and tuning capability, specialty instruments for color, and backup instruments for equipment failures, and assessing whether technical support and troubleshooting resources prevent session delays through studio technician or assistant engineer availability, manufacturer support contacts for equipment issues, spare cables and adapters preventing connectivity problems, maintenance records and equipment health monitoring, software license validation, and emergency equipment rental relationships for failures.

**3. Performance Capture & Tracking Readiness** — Evaluating whether performer preparation maximizes studio productivity through material rehearsal achieving comfortable performance without over-rehearsal staleness, technical facility on instruments or vocals preventing unnecessary retakes, stamina and endurance for sustained recording sessions, click track comfort if tracking to metronome, headphone mix preferences communicated, performance anxiety management strategies, and realistic self-assessment of current capabilities, examining whether recording technique selection matches intended sound through microphone placement strategies (close vs distant, single vs multi-mic, stereo techniques like XY, ORTF, spaced pair), room mic usage for ambience and depth, isolation vs bleed considerations (controlling bleed or embracing ensemble interaction), direct injection vs amplifier miking, phase relationships between multiple mics on same source, and validation through test recordings before committed takes, determining whether click track and reference strategy supports performance through tempo map creation for songs with tempo changes, click tone selection and volume (avoiding distraction while maintaining audibility), guide track layering (scratch vocals, melodic reference, rhythmic reference), count-in and downbeat clarity, practice with click building comfort, alternative approaches (no click for organic feel, post-recording alignment), and performer preference accommodated when possible, assessing whether tracking order and session flow optimize quality through foundation rhythm section first (drums and bass establishing groove), guide instruments/vocals maintaining vibe, overdubs adding elaboration without losing energy, difficult passages when energy and focus highest, easier material when fatigue setting in, creative "magic take" captures versus technical perfection obsession, and flexibility responding to session momentum, verifying whether take selection and comping strategy yields best performances through recording multiple complete takes vs punching problematic sections, marking takes during recording (good/great/keep), objective assessment of technical vs emotional quality, composite editing from best sections (comping), preserving spontaneous moments vs polishing every detail, and documentation preventing confusion about which takes selected, examining whether headphone monitoring serves performers through adequate headphone distribution system (multiple discrete mixes), volume and balance preference per performer, click track presence and volume per performer, latency minimization preventing timing issues (buffer size adjustment, direct monitoring), foldback from live room, isolation preventing bleed into microphones, and performer comfort prioritizing performance quality, determining whether performance correction and editing approach is established through tuning correction philosophy (transparent Auto-Tune for pitch only vs creative effect, manual melodyne editing), timing correction methods (grid quantization vs manual nudging vs preserving human feel), performance enhancement vs natural preservation balance, knowing when re-recording beats editing, and ethical transparency when corrections extensive, and assessing whether creative experimentation is balanced with efficiency through time allocated for trying alternative takes or approaches, documentation of experiments for later consideration, knowing when exploration becomes counterproductive, producer's guidance on when "good enough" vs "one more take," and protecting creative freshness preventing overthinking ruining spontaneity.

**4. Sound Design & Sonic Palette Readiness** — Assessing whether production aesthetic is clearly defined and communicated through reference tracks illustrating desired sound (tonal balance, dynamics, space, production techniques), mood boards or visual references establishing vibe, terminology shared among team (describing sounds as "warm," "aggressive," "spacious" with common understanding), genre conventions honored or intentionally subverted, sonic identity differentiating project from peers, consistency or intentional variety across project tracks, and validation that aesthetic aligns with composition and arrangement, examining whether instrument and sound source selection serves vision through acoustic vs electric instrument decisions, vintage vs modern equipment choices, organic vs electronic sound balance, ethnic or world instruments for texture and flavor, found sounds and field recordings, synthesizer and virtual instrument palette, sample libraries and loops appropriateness, and preparation of all sources before tracking (tuning, condition, testing), determining whether microphone technique and placement achieve intended character through tonal character of mic choice (bright condenser, warm ribbon, punchy dynamic), proximity effect usage (close for bass, distant for natural), room ambience capture (close for isolation, distant for space), stereo imaging techniques (width and depth), creative miking (inside piano, unconventional positions), testing and comparison of options, and documentation for consistency across sessions, evaluating whether tracking effects and processing serve sound through reverb and ambience during tracking vs added in mix, compression during recording (committing to sound vs preserving dynamic range), guitar and bass amp tone shaping, vocal chain processing (preamp, compression, EQ, de-esser), creative effects (reverse reverb, delay throws, distortion), printing effects to track vs non-destructive processing, and knowing when decisions should wait for mixing, verifying whether sound layering and texture building strategies are planned through multiple guitar amp takes for thickness, vocal doubling and harmonies approach, percussion and auxiliary sounds, synthesizer pad and texture layers, sound effects and ear candy integration, density appropriate for genre and section, and knowing when more is more vs less is more, examining whether spatial and depth decisions are considered during tracking through foreground vs background element planning, room tone and ambience capture, reverb send vs natural room recording, stereo width strategies, mono compatibility considerations, depth cues (brightness, room tone, volume), and three-dimensional mix visualization during recording, determining whether creative production techniques elevate material through backwards tracking and reverse effects, tape effects and lo-fi processing, re-amping and acoustic space treatments, unconventional microphone placements or techniques, happy accidents capitalization, sampling and reprocessing recorded material, and producer creativity bringing fresh ideas, and assessing whether sound quality baselines prevent substandard recordings through signal-to-noise ratio adequate for quiet passages, distortion-free clean recordings with headroom, phase coherence when using multiple mics, eliminating technical artifacts (clicks, pops, RF interference, ground loops), consistent sound across takes, proper gain staging from source to DAW, and addressing issues during tracking not hoping to "fix it in the mix."

**5. Production Workflow & Collaboration Readiness** — Evaluating whether creative decision-making process is clearly defined through producer's authority on artistic choices, artist's veto or approval requirements, collaborative consensus-building approach, A&R or label involvement in major decisions, compromise strategies when disagreements arise, timeline for decisions (real-time vs reflection periods), and documentation of decisions preventing revisiting settled matters, examining whether communication systems support efficient collaboration through tracking notes and session logs, shared drive or cloud storage for files and references, messaging system for asynchronous communication (Slack, email protocols), real-time communication during sessions (talkback system, video calls for remote participants), feedback delivery methods (written notes, audio notes, annotated sessions), revision request clarity and prioritization, and regular check-ins maintaining alignment, determining whether file organization prevents confusion and loss through consistent naming conventions (artist-song-date-take), folder structure by song, instrument, or session, version control and numbering, master vs working copies clearly labeled, export and bounce folder organization, documentation of settings and signal chains, metadata tagging, and cleanup of unused files maintaining order, assessing whether session documentation captures important information through session notes per tracking day (what was recorded, settings used, issues encountered, creative decisions, action items), signal chain and processing documentation (mic, preamp, outboard gear, plugins), take labeling and producer comments, tuning and tempo reference, recall sheets for analog gear, and archived references for future sessions, verifying whether backup and data management prevent catastrophic loss through real-time backup during sessions (RAID or automatic backup), end-of-day full session backup to multiple locations (external drives, cloud storage, studio archive), versioned backups preserving history, offsite backup copy, testing backup integrity and restoration procedures, retention policy for raw files vs processed files, and disaster recovery planning, examining whether remote collaboration tools enable distributed workflows through high-quality file transfer (Dropbox, Google Drive, WeTransfer), session exchange formats (AAF, OMF, stems), time zone coordination and scheduling, video conferencing for creative discussion, version control preventing conflicting edits, latency-free collaboration tools (Audiomovers, Source-Connect for real-time remote recording), and clear communication compensating for lack of physical presence, determining whether revision workflow manages changes efficiently through change request documentation and approval, revision numbering and version tracking, understanding "final" vs "really final," consolidating feedback from multiple stakeholders, prioritizing revision importance and urgency, budget and time allocation for revisions, and knowing when iteration helps vs harms, and assessing whether interpersonal dynamics support creative productivity through clear and respectful communication, constructive criticism delivery, creative disagreement resolution without ego damage, celebrating successes and milestones, managing stress and pressure healthily, recognizing when to pause vs push through tensions, and maintaining professional relationships for future collaborations.

**6. Quality Control & Deliverables Readiness** — Assessing whether listening and evaluation standards maintain consistency through reference track comparison during sessions, A/B testing of takes and approaches, objective technical assessment (tuning, timing, noise, artifacts), subjective emotional response assessment, multiple playback systems checking translation, fresh ears rest preventing ear fatigue distortion, and trusted second opinions providing perspective, examining whether technical specifications meet delivery requirements through sample rate and bit depth consistency, track count and session organization for mixing handoff, headroom preservation (peaks at -6dB to -3dB maximum), phase coherence and stereo compatibility, file format and delivery specifications, metadata and session documentation completeness, stem organization if required, and archive preparation for future use, determining whether mixing handoff preparation ensures smooth transition through consolidation of audio files to session start, removal of unused takes and files, track labeling clarity, rough mix with notes on vision, documentation of creative decisions and processing, organized folder structure, testing session opens correctly, and communication with mixing engineer on expectations, evaluating whether revision and feedback systems enable quality improvement through structured listening sessions with stakeholders, specific and actionable feedback (not vague "make it better"), distinguishing preference from objective issues, timeline for feedback and revision turnarounds, budget allocation for changes, documentation of feedback and responses, and maintaining creative vision amid multiple opinions, verifying whether project timeline and milestone tracking maintains momentum through completion percentage tracking per song, dependencies between tasks identified, critical path understanding, deadline realism and buffer time, communication with stakeholders on progress, celebration of completed milestones, and adjustment when slipping preventing cascade delays, examining whether deliverable preparation meets professional standards through track count and format per delivery spec, file naming and metadata, sample rate and bit depth verification, volume levels and headroom check, edit points and fades cleanliness, technical artifact elimination, virus scan and file integrity check, and clear labeling of delivered content, determining whether archival and long-term storage preserve investment through organized archive of all session files, raw recordings separate from processed files, documentation and notes included, multiple storage locations preventing single point of failure, refresh of media preventing degradation, cloud vs local storage strategy, accessibility for future remixing or mastering, and retention policy based on project type, and assessing whether legal and business documentation protects all parties through work-for-hire vs royalty agreements clarity, split sheets completed and signed, sample clearance if applicable, session musician releases and payments, master recording ownership clear, producer and engineer points negotiated, publishing rights documented, and professional advisors consulted on complex matters.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Independent Artist — Debut Album Production

**Context:** Singer-songwriter "Maya Rivers" assessing readiness for recording debut album "Undercurrents" at mid-tier local studio. 8 songs, $12K budget including production and mixing (mastering separate). Recording approach: live basic tracks with full band (drums, bass, guitar, keys), then vocal and guitar overdubs. Studio booked: 10 days across 3 weeks. Maya's first professional studio experience beyond demos. Band members are friends, some session experience but not professionals.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 2.8/5.0** (Planning Development stage)
- **Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 3.1/5.0** — Moderate planning. Recording approach defined (live basics then overdubs makes sense for folk-rock aesthetic), 10-day studio booking realistic for 8 songs if efficient ($1,200/day × 10 = $12K leaving nothing for mixing — budget error). Pre-production demos recorded and shared with band (good). Session schedule blocked but not detailed (day 1-3 basics, day 4-7 overdubs, day 8-10 vocals too vague). Creative roles defined (producer is studio owner, Maya has final say, band trusts her vision). Major gaps: no contingency time in schedule, mixing not budgeted, no accommodation for band members traveling 2 hours, catering not considered, no backup studio if technical issues.

- **Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 3.8/5.0** — Studio capable. Mid-sized facility with good reputation, SSL console, Pro Tools HDX system, extensive mic collection including Neumanns and AKGs, three rooms (control room, large tracking room, isolation booth). Monitoring good (Focal monitors, Yamaha NS-10s reference). Equipment maintained and recently serviced. Engineer experienced in genre. Technical specs appropriate (24-bit/48kHz recording). Only concern: Maya hasn't visited studio for walkthrough (relying on website and phone call), and studio's drum room sound not validated for Maya's aesthetic preference (she wants warm intimate sound, studio photos suggest bright live sound).

- **Performance Capture & Tracking: 2.4/5.0** — Significant concerns. Performer preparation uneven: Maya very prepared (songs demoed, arrangements finalized, guitar parts rehearsed), drummer comfortable with click but hasn't practiced with guide tracks, bassist learned songs but never tracked in professional studio (anxiety potential), keys player solid, rhythm guitarist experienced. No full-band rehearsal in final month before recording (busy schedules, relying on individual practice). Click track strategy basic (straight metronome, no tempo mapping for songs with natural feels). Recording technique not discussed with engineer (Maya assuming engineer will handle, but preferences not communicated). Headphone mix requirements not discussed. Take selection philosophy undefined (how many takes per song? Comp multiple takes or capture one great performance?).

- **Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 3.3/5.0** — Vision clear but techniques uncertain. Production aesthetic well-defined (warm indie folk-rock, references like Phoebe Bridgers, Sufjan Stevens, early Bon Iver — intimate, detailed, organic with subtle electronic textures). Instrument selection good (analog synths for pads, acoustic instruments foundation, vintage guitar amps for warmth). Reference tracks shared with engineer. Sonic identity distinctive (Maya's fingerpicking style, breathy vocals, melancholic mood). Gaps: microphone technique preferences not communicated to engineer (close intimate vs room ambience?), tracking effects not discussed (reverb during tracking or dry?), synthesizer/effect chains not tested in studio context, and layering strategy vague (how many guitar tracks? Vocal double approach?).

- **Production Workflow & Collaboration: 2.6/5.0** — Workflow underdeveloped. Creative decisions: producer/engineer will guide technical choices, Maya has final artistic say, band trusts Maya. Communication: informal (text group chat, no formal documentation). File organization: studio will handle (Maya not involved in session organization or backup planning). Session documentation: minimal planning (studio's standard notes only). Backup: studio has RAID system (basic redundancy). No remote collaboration needs. Revision workflow undefined. Major concerns: no formal pre-production meeting with producer to align vision, no session notes template or documentation plan beyond engineer's standard practice, and Maya unfamiliar with studio workflow (potential inefficiency from learning curve).

- **Quality Control & Deliverables: 2.3/5.0** — Weakest dimension. Listening standards not established (what playback systems to reference?). Technical specs defined (24/48 WAV files) but deliverables unclear (stems? Rough mixes? Archive organization?). Mixing handoff not discussed (Maya assumes studio engineer will mix, but mixing not in $12K budget which is studio time only). No timeline for feedback and revisions. Quality benchmarks undefined (how will Maya know takes are "good enough"?). Legal documentation incomplete (no split sheets prepared for band contributions, no work-for-hire agreements with session players if needed, no producer points negotiated). Critical gap: mixing not budgeted means Maya needs separate $3-5K for mixing after spending full budget on tracking, or must mix at different studio/mixer with potential communication challenges.

**Critical Blockers Identified:**

1. **Mixing Not Budgeted — Financial Planning Error** (Impact: CRITICAL, Urgency: CRITICAL) — $12K budget allocated entirely to 10-day studio time ($1,200/day) with no funds for mixing. Maya assumed studio time included mixing, but $12K only covers tracking. Professional mixing requires $2,500-5,000 for album (8 songs at $300-600/song). Project cannot complete without mixing budget. **Action Required:** (Option A) Renegotiate studio to 7 days tracking ($8,400) + 3 days mixing ($3,600) = $12K total, accepting reduced tracking time requiring extreme efficiency, (Option B) Find additional $3-5K funding (crowdfunding campaign, family loan, credit card), or (Option C) Mix yourself in home studio (learning curve, quality compromise, but financially feasible). Decision needed immediately before studio dates.

2. **No Full-Band Rehearsal Before Tracking** (Impact: HIGH, Urgency: CRITICAL) — Band members prepared individually but no group rehearsal in final month. First time playing together will be in expensive studio ($1,200/day). Risk: wasting 1-2 days working out arrangements, tempos, transitions that should be solidified beforehand. Previous rehearsals were 2 months ago. **Action Required:** Schedule 2 full-band rehearsals in 2 weeks before studio (total $300 rehearsal space rental + time), running all 8 songs start-to-finish with click track, finalizing tempos and dynamics, discussing transitions and cues, building comfort and chemistry, and identifying any problem sections needing extra attention. Non-negotiable for studio efficiency.

3. **Studio Acoustic Sound Not Validated** (Impact: HIGH, Urgency: HIGH) — Maya wants warm intimate drum sound (like Bon Iver), but studio photos and website suggest bright live room. Haven't visited studio or heard drum sound. Aesthetic mismatch could waste tracking time trying different approaches or require booking different studio. **Action Required:** Visit studio within next week for walkthrough and test recording (2-hour session, potentially free or $200). Record 2 songs with drummer in studio's tracking room, listen in control room, assess if acoustic matches vision. If sound wrong, either (A) accept and adjust expectations, (B) request extensive baffling and damping altering room sound, or (C) book different studio if still available (risky with approaching dates). Must validate before commitment.

4. **Session Schedule Too Vague — Inefficiency Risk** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: HIGH) — "Days 1-3 basics, days 4-7 overdubs, days 8-10 vocals" lacks detail. No song-by-song plan, no time allocations per task, no contingency. Vague schedule causes indecision and wasted time during expensive sessions. **Action Required:** Create detailed session plan with engineer input: Day 1 AM - setup and drum sounds, PM - track drums/bass/rhythm for songs 1-3; Day 2 - track drums/bass/rhythm for songs 4-6; Day 3 - track drums/bass/rhythm for songs 7-8, begin lead guitar overdubs; Day 4-5 - complete all guitar and keys overdubs; Day 6-8 - vocal production (2-3 songs per day); Day 9 - vocal finishing, additional overdubs, magic moments; Day 10 - editing, rough mixes, archive. Schedule shared with all participants before sessions.

5. **Legal and Business Documentation Incomplete** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: MEDIUM) — No split sheets for band contributions, no producer points negotiated, no work-for-hire agreements. If Maya later generates income from recordings (streaming, sync licensing), disputes possible about ownership and splits. Professional practice requires documentation. **Action Required:** (A) Prepare split sheets documenting songwriting contributions (Maya wrote all songs, so 100% songwriting credit to her, band are performers only receiving session fees if applicable), (B) Negotiate producer points with studio owner/producer (typical 2-5% of net receipts, or flat fee with no points), (C) If paying session fees to any band members, have them sign work-for-hire releases granting Maya master ownership, (D) Consult music attorney or use online template services ($200-500 for basic contracts). Complete before studio session 1.

**Recommended Action Plan** (3-Week Pre-Production):

*Week 1: Financial and Logistics Resolution*
- Day 1-2: Resolve mixing budget crisis (renegotiate studio deal or secure additional funding)
- Day 3-4: Legal documentation preparation (split sheets, producer agreement, work-for-hire releases)
- Day 5: Studio visit and acoustic validation (test drum recording, assess sound)
- Day 6-7: Detailed session schedule creation with engineer input

*Week 2: Rehearsal and Refinement*
- Day 1-2: Full-band rehearsal #1 (run all 8 songs, finalize tempos and arrangements)
- Day 3-5: Individual practice addressing issues identified in rehearsal
- Day 6-7: Full-band rehearsal #2 (polish performances, build chemistry, practice with click)

*Week 3: Final Preparation*
- Day 1-2: Pre-production meeting with producer (share references, discuss techniques, align vision)
- Day 3-4: Create and share guide tracks with finalized tempos for band member practice
- Day 5: Equipment prep (fresh strings, drum tuning, gear organization)
- Day 6-7: Rest and vocal care before studio

**Revised Budget Allocation:**
- Studio tracking (7 days): $8,400
- Studio mixing (3 days): $3,600
- Rehearsal space: $300
- Studio visit/test: $200
- Legal templates: $300
- Contingency: $200 (minimal but realistic)
- **Total: $13,000** (need additional $1,000 beyond original $12K)

**Success Metrics:**
- Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 3.1 → 3.8 (detailed schedule, realistic budget including mixing, rehearsal plan)
- Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 3.8 → 4.0 (studio validated, acoustic confirmed appropriate)
- Performance Capture & Tracking: 2.4 → 3.5 (band rehearsed and prepared, click track practiced, recording approach discussed)
- Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 3.3 → 3.7 (techniques discussed with engineer, reference tracks reviewed, layering strategy defined)
- Production Workflow & Collaboration: 2.6 → 3.4 (pre-production meeting held, session plan detailed, documentation system established)
- Quality Control & Deliverables: 2.3 → 3.3 (mixing budgeted and planned, legal documentation complete, deliverable specs confirmed)
- **Target Overall: 2.8 → 3.6** (recording-ready with professional planning and risk mitigation)

### Example 2: Established Band — Album Recording at Professional Facility

**Context:** 4-piece rock band "The Voltage" recording 4th album "Circuits" at renowned tracking studio. 12 songs, $80K all-in budget (tracking, mixing, mastering, production). 4-week studio block. Professional producer with multiple gold records hired. Band members age 30-35, touring musicians, previous albums successful (100K+ units each). Label involved (indie label with major distribution), A&R oversight, release date set for 6 months out.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 4.1/5.0** (Professional Standard)
- **Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 4.3/5.0** — Excellent planning. Recording approach: live basic tracking for maximum energy (drums, bass, rhythm guitar, guide vocals), then overdubs for leads, solos, additional layers, final vocals. 4-week schedule realistic and detailed (week 1: setup and first 6 songs basics, week 2: songs 7-12 basics, week 3: overdubs and guitar tracking, week 4: vocals and production details). Pre-production exceptional (two months of rehearsal, pre-pro demo sessions with producer, arrangements finalized, tempos locked). Budget allocation professional ($40K studio time, $15K producer fee, $10K session musicians/string section, $10K mixing, $3K mastering, $2K contingency). Creative roles clear (producer has strong artistic input, band has final approval, A&R provides commercial perspective, collaborative decision-making). Minor concern: 6-month release timeline tight if any delays occur (album due to mixing 4 weeks from studio start, mixed within 6 weeks total, mastered by week 10, leaving only 2 months for manufacturing and marketing).

- **Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 4.6/5.0** — World-class facility. Renowned tracking studio with multiple rooms, Neve console, Pro Tools HDX, extensive microphone collection (vintage Neumann, AKG, Telefunken), isolation booths, live room with tuned acoustics. Monitoring reference-level (main monitors, near-fields, multiple playback systems). Equipment maintained to highest standard, technical staff onsite. Engineer experienced with producer's workflow. Only minor considerations: studio books 6 months in advance (dates confirmed), and band's preference for specific vintage guitar amp not in studio inventory (bringing own amps and pedals handled by band tech).

- **Performance Capture & Tracking: 4.4/5.0** — Highly prepared. Performers fully rehearsed (2 months pre-production, songs in live setlist for 3 months, arrangements battle-tested). Click track fluency high (toured with click for years). Recording techniques discussed and validated in pre-pro (mic placements tested, sounds dialed in). Tracking order planned (most energetic songs first capturing excitement, ballads mid-recording, ambitious songs when comfortable with studio). Take selection philosophy clear (capture best complete performances, limited comping, prioritizing energy over perfection). Headphone mixes designed (drummer wants loud guitars for feel, bassist wants kick and snare emphasis). Minor gap: lead vocalist has mild cold 2 weeks before tracking (vocal rest and steaming regimen required, backup plan if voice not 100%).

- **Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 4.5/5.0** — Clear and validated aesthetic. Production concept: modern rock with vintage warmth, references include Queens of the Stone Age, Arctic Monkeys, Royal Blood (powerful drums, thick bass, guitar-forward, anthemic vocals). Instrument selection locked (band's touring gear, specific amps and pedals, vintage Ludwig drum kit, '70s Rickenbacker bass). Microphone techniques planned (close and room mics on drums, dual amps on guitars, bass DI + amp blend). Tracking effects strategy defined (print reverb and delays on guitars, dry vocals for mixing flexibility, commit to bass tone, drum ambience decisions during tracking). Sound layering planned (triple-tracked rhythm guitars, octave doubling on choruses, synthesizer pads on 3 ballads). Sonic identity distinctive (band's established sound with evolutionary refinement, not reinvention).

- **Production Workflow & Collaboration: 4.0/5.0** — Professional systems in place. Creative decisions: producer leads tracking, band provides input and approval, A&R reviews weekly progress, collaborative consensus culture. Communication: daily production meetings, shared Google Drive for notes and references, Signal group chat for quick coordination. File organization: producer's template system (song folders, take logging, metadata tagging, automated backup). Session documentation: detailed tracking notes, signal chain records, recall sheets for analog settings. Backup: studio RAID system, end-of-day backups to multiple drives, weekly cloud backup. Slight concern: A&R involvement could slow decision-making if disagreements arise (hasn't happened yet but protocol for escalation undefined), and label timeline pressure may force compromises if creative vision requires more time.

- **Quality Control & Deliverables: 3.8/5.0** — Good but some gaps. Listening standards: reference tracks, multiple playback systems, A/B comparison to demos. Technical specs defined (24-bit/96kHz tracking, 24-bit/48kHz delivery to match previous albums). Mixing handoff planned (mixing engineer hired, specs provided, communication protocol established). Revision workflow defined (mixing revisions: 2 rounds per song, then lock). Timeline tracking (Asana project management, milestone checklist). Gaps: mastering engineer not yet confirmed (producer has relationships but not booked), vinyl lacquer cutting not budgeted if vinyl release needed (label decision pending), and stem delivery requirements not clarified (label may want stems for sync licensing - would require additional organization and delivery time).

**Critical Observations (Minor Refinements):**

1. **Lead Vocalist Mild Illness Risk** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: HIGH) — Singer has cold 2 weeks before tracking, voice at 80%. Vocal tracking scheduled week 4, but voice needs full recovery. Risk of delayed vocal sessions or suboptimal performances. **Action Required:** (A) Vocal rest protocol immediately (no unnecessary talking, no singing, adequate sleep, hydration, steaming), (B) Consult with ENT or vocal coach within 3 days assessing recovery timeline, (C) Reschedule vocal tracking to end of week 4 or days after main studio block ends (studio availability permitting), giving maximum recovery time, (D) Backup plan: if voice not 100%, focus on backing vocals and scratch leads, return for final leads 1-2 weeks later (budget $3K additional studio days from contingency). Proactive monitoring essential.

2. **Timeline Pressure From Label** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: MEDIUM) — 6-month release deadline leaves limited buffer. Studio ends week 4, mixing needs 6 weeks, mastering 2 weeks = week 12 completion, leaving 14 weeks for manufacturing, marketing, press, radio promotion. Typical rock album campaign needs 16-20 weeks. Any studio delay cascades. **Action Required:** (A) Discuss timeline with label A&R today, confirm absolutely firm release date vs flexible target, (B) If firm, identify which marketing elements can parallel production (photoshoot during studio, interviews during mixing, single selection week 2 allowing early promotion), (C) If flexible, negotiate 4-6 week buffer pushing release to month 7-8, (D) Expedited vinyl pressing option if physical release critical (premium cost but faster turnaround). Timeline management crucial throughout recording preventing scope creep.

3. **A&R Involvement Decision Process Undefined** (Impact: LOW, Urgency: MEDIUM) — A&R reviews progress weekly, provides input on commercial decisions (single selection, radio-friendly production). But if A&R strongly disagrees with creative direction, escalation process undefined (band's vision vs label's commercial concerns). Could cause mid-production tension. **Action Required:** Pre-emptive conversation with A&R, producer, and band establishing decision-making framework: (A) Artistic decisions (song arrangements, production aesthetic, performances) remain band/producer domain with A&R input but not approval, (B) Commercial decisions (single selection, editing for radio, release strategy) are collaborative with label having final say, (C) If irreconcilable disagreement, band manager mediates before escalating to label head, (D) Document agreement in email preventing misunderstanding. Establish before studio week 1.

4. **Mastering Engineer and Vinyl Not Yet Confirmed** (Impact: LOW, Urgency: LOW) — Mastering engineer relationships exist but not yet booked (studio block ends in 4 weeks, mixing finishes week 10, mastering needed week 11-12). Vinyl release decision pending from label (affects mastering approach and lacquer cutting budget). **Action Required:** (A) Book mastering engineer within 2 weeks (availability for week 11-12 confirmed, rate negotiated, timeline committed), (B) Get label decision on vinyl within 2 weeks (if yes, add $2K vinyl mastering + lacquer cutting to budget, confirm pressing plant and timeline), (C) If vinyl yes, communicate with mastering engineer about vinyl-specific mastering needs (side lengths, bass management, limiting approach). Relatively low urgency but avoid scrambling post-mixing.

5. **Stem Delivery Requirements Unclear** (Impact: LOW, Urgency: LOW) — Label may require stems for sync licensing opportunities (film/TV placements). Stem export (drums, bass, guitars, vocals, other) requires organization and additional export time. Not yet discussed. **Action Required:** Clarify with label A&R within 1 week whether stems required (typically yes for commercial releases). If required, (A) Plan stem organization during mixing (mixing engineer includes stem bouncing in workflow), (B) Add 2-3 hours per song for stem export and QA (~30 hours total = $4K additional cost in mixing), (C) Define stem spec (stereo vs surround, sample rate, bit depth, how granular - e.g. separate lead guitar from rhythm?), (D) Budget and timeline accommodation. Better to know upfront than scramble post-mix.

**Production Recommendation: GREEN LIGHT WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS**

Project is professionally planned and ready for recording. Minor refinements around timeline management, vocalist health, and deliverable specs will further derisk production.

**Success Metrics Already Strong:**
- Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 4.3 → 4.5 (after timeline negotiation and contingency planning)
- Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 4.6/5.0 (world-class, no improvements needed)
- Performance Capture & Tracking: 4.4 → 4.5 (after vocalist recovery and backup planning)
- Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 4.5/5.0 (clear, validated, distinctive)
- Production Workflow & Collaboration: 4.0 → 4.3 (after A&R decision framework and stem delivery clarity)
- Quality Control & Deliverables: 3.8 → 4.1 (after mastering booking and vinyl/stem specs confirmed)
- **Target Overall: 4.1 → 4.4** (industry-leading professional production)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Efficient 4-week recording capturing band's live energy and powerful performances
- High-quality professional album meeting label's commercial expectations while maintaining artistic integrity
- On-time and on-budget delivery supporting 6-month release timeline
- Album positioning band for next career level (festival headlining, larger venue touring, increased streaming and sync opportunities)

### Example 3: Electronic Producer — Hybrid Studio/Home Production

**Context:** Electronic music producer "VΞKTOR" assessing production readiness for EP "Neon Dreams" blending analog synthesizers with digital production. 5 tracks, hybrid approach: recording analog synths and live drums at professional studio (5 days), remaining production in home studio (programming, sampling, arrangement, sound design). $8K budget ($5K studio time, $1.5K mixing, $1K mastering, $500 contingency). VΞKTOR experienced in home production (released 2 previous EPs, 500K total streams) but first time working with analog gear and live musicians in pro studio.

**Assessment Highlights:**
- **Current Overall Score: 3.4/5.0** (Recording-Ready with caveats)
- **Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 3.6/5.0** — Solid hybrid approach. Recording strategy clear: 5-day studio block capturing analog synthesizer parts (Moog, Prophet, Juno) and live drums to inject organic texture into otherwise electronic production, then returning to home studio for arrangement, programming, vocals, and mixing. Schedule realistic (day 1: synth recording sessions 1-2 tracks, day 2: synth tracks 3-5, day 3-4: drum sessions, day 5: additional synth layers and wild sounds). Pre-production thorough (MIDI mockups of all tracks, tempo and key locked, synthesizer patches designed and saved, drum arrangements programmed as guide). Budget appropriate for limited studio scope. Creative roles defined (VΞKTOR sole artist, studio engineer for technical execution, friend/collaborator providing drum performances). Minor concerns: 5 days tight if synthesizer programming takes longer than anticipated (working with unfamiliar analog gear vs home digital synths), and no mixing engineer hired yet (may self-mix or budget $1.5K insufficient for professional electronic mixing at $300-400/track).

- **Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 4.0/5.0** — Studio well-equipped for electronic production. Mid-sized studio specializing in electronic/hybrid productions, extensive analog synthesizer collection (Moog Minimoog, Prophet 5, Juno 106, Oberheim OB-6, Korg MS-20, modular systems), drum tracking room, Ableton Live and Pro Tools capability, quality audio interface and conversion. Engineer experienced with electronic producers' workflows. VΞKTOR's home studio adequate (Mac, Ableton Live 12, UAD Apollo interface, decent monitoring, sample libraries). Only concern: synthesizer patch recall complexity (analog synths without patch memory require manual recreation — will engineer photograph settings for later recall? Or commit to recorded sounds?), and home studio mixing environment not acoustically treated (compromising mixing decisions).

- **Performance Capture & Tracking: 3.2/5.0** — Mixed preparation. Synthesizer recording: VΞKTOR familiar with synthesizer programming concepts (ADSR, filters, modulation) but limited hands-on experience with specific analog models at studio — learning curve will consume some studio time. Patches pre-designed on soft synths, but translating to different hardware requires experimentation. Drummer experienced session player, rehearsed with VΞKTOR's programmed tracks, comfortable with click and electronic production aesthetic. Recording technique: engineer will guide (DI recording synths, room and close mics on drums), VΞKTOR trusts process. Take selection: synth parts can be punched and edited, drum performances need good complete takes (drummer capable). Weakness: synthesizer session may be inefficient due to learning curve on unfamiliar gear, no backup plan if can't achieve desired sounds quickly.

- **Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 4.2/5.0** — Strongest dimension. Production aesthetic clearly defined: dark melodic techno meets cinematic electronica, references include Jon Hopkins, ARTBAT, Tale of Us (driving beats, lush pads, emotional melodies, analog warmth blending with digital precision). Sonic identity distinctive (VΞKTOR's established sound: arpeggiated melodies, atmospheric pads, ethnic vocal samples, heavy side-chain compression). Analog synthesizer recording goals: warm bass tones from Moog, lush evolving pads from Prophet, aggressive leads from MS-20, rhythmic sequences from modular. Live drum addition: organic texture and human groove to contrast programmed elements. Layering strategy defined (analog synth foundation, digital synths adding complexity, drum loops and samples supporting live drums). Strong creative vision.

- **Production Workflow & Collaboration: 3.3/5.0** — Adequate but improvable. File organization: VΞKTOR's system for home studio (song project folders, stems, samples organized), but studio session organization relies on engineer. Communication: direct with engineer and drummer, no formal documentation. Session documentation: engineer will provide session files and notes, photos of synth settings. Backup: studio has backup system, VΞKTOR will receive files on hard drive. Home studio workflow: organized (Ableton projects, sample library, template tracks). Gaps: no session notes template capturing creative decisions during recording, no documented recall for analog synth settings (critical for returning weeks later to add layers — settings may not be recreatable), no cloud backup from studio (relying on single hard drive).

- **Quality Control & Deliverables: 3.0/5.0** — Some concerns. Listening standards: VΞKTOR references heavily during production, uses multiple playback systems (studio monitors, headphones, car stereo, phone speaker). Technical specs appropriate (24-bit/48kHz standard for electronic music, matching streaming delivery). Mixing approach undecided (self-mix in home studio to save budget, or allocate $1.5K for professional mixing — decision affects quality). Mastering budgeted ($1K, appropriate for 5-track EP with professional mastering engineer). Deliverables: WAV and MP3 for streaming, stems for potential remixes. Concerns: home studio mixing environment lacks acoustic treatment (may produce poor translation), self-mixing introduces objectivity loss (producer/mixer should ideally be separate for perspective), and revision process undefined (feedback from whom? How many revisions?).

**Critical Observations (Moderate Preparation Needed):**

1. **Analog Synthesizer Learning Curve Inefficiency Risk** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: HIGH) — VΞKTOR designed patches on soft synths but limited experience with physical analog synths at studio. Different hardware interfaces, different sound characteristics, learning curve will consume expensive studio time experimenting. 5-day schedule assumes efficiency, but could stretch to 6-7 days. **Action Required:** (A) Schedule 2-hour pre-session at studio ($200-300) 1-2 weeks before main block, hands-on orientation with Moog, Prophet, MS-20 learning interfaces and workflow, test translating 2-3 soft synth patches to hardware, (B) Bring soft synth preset screenshots and notes for engineer reference, (C) Prioritize "must-have" synth parts vs "nice-to-have" (if time runs short, cut lower-priority layers), (D) Consider remote programming session with studio engineer before visit (video call, engineer runs hardware, VΞKTOR directs patch design). Pre-session investment saves multiples in main block efficiency.

2. **Mixing Decision and Home Studio Environment** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: MEDIUM) — Self-mixing in untreated home studio vs professional mixing trade-off. Self-mixing saves $1.5K but risks poor translation (bass-heavy or thin mix due to room acoustics), and mixing own production loses objectivity. Professional mixing costs $300-400/track × 5 = $1,500-2,000, exceeding $1.5K budget. **Action Required:** (A) Invest $300-500 in home studio acoustic treatment (bass traps, absorption panels, diffusion) improving mixing environment before self-mixing decision, (B) Test mix one track start-to-finish, export, test on 5+ playback systems (club PA, home stereo, car, phone, earbuds), assess translation quality, (C) If translation poor, allocate professional mixing budget by either reducing studio days from 5 to 4 (saving $1K, accepting less synth layering), or finding additional $500 funding, (D) If translation acceptable, self-mix with frequent reference checking and fresh ears breaks. Decision by week before studio block.

3. **Analog Synth Settings Recall and Documentation** (Impact: MEDIUM, Urgency: MEDIUM) — Analog synths lack patch memory (except Prophet with limited storage). After studio block, VΞKTOR returning home for weeks of arrangement and production before potentially needing more synth parts. Recreating settings impossible without documentation. **Action Required:** (A) Confirm engineer will photograph every synthesizer panel setting (wide shot + closeups of knob positions) for each recorded part, (B) Engineer annotates photos with take number, song, synth part name, (C) Engineer documents MIDI note range, velocity, and any external processing (compression, EQ) applied during recording, (D) VΞKTOR receives detailed PDF recall sheet with photos and notes for each sound, (E) Alternative: commit to all synthesizer parts during 5-day block (no later overdubs), accepting limitations but ensuring no recreation needed. Documentation essential if future overdubs anticipated.

4. **Drummer Integration and Electronic Music Context** (Impact: LOW, Urgency: LOW) — Live drummer experienced with electronic music aesthetic, but specific integration approach not fully discussed. Will drums sit on top of mix (loud and prominent) or blend in texture (subtle humanization)? Will drum processing happen during tracking (reverb, compression) or left for mixing? Drummer's playing dynamic range appropriate for heavily compressed electronic music? **Action Required:** Reference track listening session with drummer before studio (10-15 minutes video call or in-person): play 3 reference tracks illustrating exact drum sound and integration goal, discuss playing dynamics (controlled vs expressive), confirm click track and guide track comfort, align expectations on takes (how many? Comp multiple vs capture best complete performance?). Quick alignment prevents misunderstanding during expensive studio time.

5. **No Dedicated Mixing Engineer Relationship** (Impact: LOW, Urgency: LOW-MEDIUM) — If professional mixing chosen, $1.5K budget requires finding affordable but capable electronic music mixer. Electronic music mixing specialists charge $400-600/track, but emerging mixers or genre specialists may work for $250-300/track fitting budget. No mixer researched or contacted yet. **Action Required:** If pursuing professional mixing, identify and contact 3-5 mixing engineer candidates within 2 weeks: (A) Search via recommendations (electronic music forums, producer communities, SoundBetter), (B) Review portfolios assessing genre match and quality, (C) Request rate quotes for 5-track EP, (D) Test one track mix (provide stems, pay for single track $250-300), assess quality and communication, (E) Book preferred engineer for full EP if satisfied. Starting early allows quality selection vs scrambling last-minute after tracking.

**Production Recommendation: PROCEED WITH PREPARATION ENHANCEMENTS**

Project ready for recording after addressing synthesizer learning curve and mixing decision. Pre-session orientation and documentation planning will significantly improve efficiency and outcome.

**Refined Timeline:**
- Week -2: Home studio acoustic treatment installation, pre-session orientation at studio
- Week -1: Mixing decision and engineer selection (if professional mixing), drummer reference listening session
- Week 1 (Studio Block): Day 1-2 synth recording, Day 3-4 drum tracking, Day 5 additional synth layers
- Week 2-4: Home production (arrangement, programming, digital synthesis, sampling)
- Week 5-6: Vocal recording and comping (if applicable, not mentioned but common in genre)
- Week 7-8: Mixing (self or professional)
- Week 9: Mastering
- **Total: 9-week production timeline from studio to release-ready**

**Success Metrics:**
- Recording Strategy & Session Planning: 3.6 → 4.0 (pre-session orientation, refined schedule, backup plans)
- Technical Infrastructure & Equipment: 4.0/5.0 (excellent, no changes needed)
- Performance Capture & Tracking: 3.2 → 3.7 (synth patch translation tested, documentation system established, drummer alignment confirmed)
- Sound Design & Sonic Palette: 4.2/5.0 (already strong, maintain vision)
- Production Workflow & Collaboration: 3.3 → 3.7 (recall documentation, cloud backup, session notes template)
- Quality Control & Deliverables: 3.0 → 3.6 (mixing decision resolved, acoustic treatment improved, revision process defined)
- **Target Overall: 3.4 → 3.8** (production-ready hybrid approach with professional efficiency)
