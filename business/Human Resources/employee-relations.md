## Quick Start

**Need to improve employee relations quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example

```

- Addressing team conflict or communication breakdowns
- Building or strengthening company culture
- Improving manager-employee relationships

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Diagnose issues** - Survey employees, analyze feedback, identify root causes
2. **Design interventions** - Communication plans, recognition programs, conflict resolution
3. **Execute and monitor** - Launch initiatives, track progress, adjust based on feedback

**Time to complete**: 4-8 weeks for initial improvements (ongoing for culture change)
