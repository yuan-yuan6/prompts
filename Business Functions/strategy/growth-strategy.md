# Growth Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether an organization can define and execute a credible growth strategy, including market expansion, product growth, partnerships, and acquisitions, while maintaining operational stability and financial discipline.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess growth strategy readiness for [ORGANIZATION] targeting growth from [CURRENT_REVENUE] to [TARGET_REVENUE] over [TIME_HORIZON]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Growth thesis & target markets, (2) Customer/product fit & differentiation, (3) Go-to-market & distribution, (4) Economics & investment model, (5) Execution capacity & scaling operations, (6) Governance & risk management. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Growth Thesis & Target Markets
- 1 — Initial: Growth goals are aspirational; target markets are broad; prioritization is unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Clear growth thesis; target segments/geographies are prioritized; criteria are explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Thesis is evidence-backed; prioritization is revisited with signals; tradeoffs are consistent.

### 2) Customer/Product Fit & Differentiation
- 1 — Initial: Value proposition is generic; product gaps are unclear; churn/retention drivers unknown.
- 3 — Defined: Fit is validated in priority segments; differentiation is articulated; roadmap supports growth thesis.
- 5 — Optimized: Fit is measured continuously; segmentation and pricing are refined; roadmap decisions reflect economics.

### 3) Go-to-Market & Distribution
- 1 — Initial: GTM is inconsistent; channels are unproven; sales/marketing handoffs are unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Channel strategy is explicit; funnel metrics are tracked; enablement exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Scalable GTM engine; predictable acquisition and expansion; efficient channel mix management.

### 4) Economics & Investment Model
- 1 — Initial: Unit economics are missing; investment needs are unclear; scenarios are not modeled.
- 3 — Defined: Unit economics and payback targets; driver-based model; scenario planning exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Capital allocation follows evidence; sensitivities guide risk limits; economics are linked to operating drivers.

### 5) Execution Capacity & Scaling Operations
- 1 — Initial: Capacity constraints are unknown; operating model cannot support growth; reliability issues emerge.
- 3 — Defined: Capacity planning exists; key processes are scalable; operational metrics are tracked.
- 5 — Optimized: Scaling playbooks; automation and standardization; reliability and quality maintained at higher volumes.

### 6) Governance & Risk Management
- 1 — Initial: Decision rights unclear; M&A/partnership risks unmanaged; compliance and integration addressed late.
- 3 — Defined: Investment gates, due diligence standards, and integration plans; risk owners are assigned.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance accelerates decisions; risk-by-design; post-mortems improve future bets.

## Deliverables
- Growth readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Prioritized growth bets and sequencing rationale
- Investment model with scenarios and guardrails
- Scaling capacity plan (people, process, technology)
- 90-day plan to improve evidence quality and execution readiness

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [CURRENT_REVENUE]: Current revenue baseline
- [TARGET_REVENUE]: Target revenue
- [TIME_HORIZON]: Time horizon (e.g., 3 years)
- [GROWTH_VECTORS]: Vectors (penetration, new markets, new products, M&A)
- [INVESTMENT_AMOUNT]: Investment envelope

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: B2B services firm expanding into two new regions
- Scores (1–5): Thesis 3; Fit 2; GTM 2; Economics 2; Scaling 3; Governance 2
- Top gaps: Unclear channel strategy, weak unit economics, limited integration readiness
- 90-day priorities: Validate target segments; define channel mix; build driver model; establish investment gates and integration playbook
