          (to herself, frustrated)
     This has to work. It just has to.

Her phone BUZZES. She glances at it, hesitates, then answers.

                    SARAH (CONT'D)
          (into phone, forcing brightness)
     Hey! Yeah, I'm working on it now.

## FORMATTING GUIDELINES

### Scene Headings
- Always UPPERCASE
- Include INT./EXT., LOCATION, TIME OF DAY
- Examples:
  * INT. OFFICE - DAY
  * EXT. PARK - NIGHT
  * INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - SUNSET

### Action Lines
- Present tense, active voice
- Only describe what can be SEEN or HEARD
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 lines max)
- Introduce characters in UPPERCASE first time
- Use double-spacing between scenes

### Dialogue
- Character name centered, UPPERCASE
- Dialogue indented below character name
- Parentheticals for emotional tone (sparingly)
- (V.O.) for voice-over
- (O.S.) for off-screen dialogue

### Transitions
- RIGHT-aligned or separate line
- Examples: CUT TO:, DISSOLVE TO:, FADE OUT

### Camera Directions
- Use sparingly, only when essential
- Examples: CLOSE-UP, WIDE SHOT, PAN TO
- Describe the purpose, not the technical specs

## VISUAL STORYTELLING NOTATION

### Camera Movements
- PUSH IN: Slow dolly toward subject
- PULL BACK: Reveal wider context
- PAN: Horizontal camera movement
- TILT: Vertical camera movement
- TRACKING SHOT: Camera follows action
- CRANE: Elevated perspective change

### Visual Effects
- [SFX: Description of visual effect]
- [GRAPHIC: Text or image overlay]
- [TRANSITION: Specific effect name]
- [COLOR GRADE: Mood or style note]

### Timing Marks
- For commercials and tight formats:
  * :00-:05 Opening sequence
  * :05-:20 Main content
  * :20-:30 Call-to-action and close

## Ensure the script format is
- Industry-standard and professional
- Production-ready and clear
- Visually descriptive without being technical
- Easy to read and follow
- Properly paced and timed
- Complete with all necessary cues
- Consistent throughout
- Platform-appropriate and optimized
```

## Variables

## Best Practices

1. **Use industry-standard formatting** - Follow established conventions for readability
2. **Be visually specific** - Describe what the audience sees, not camera angles
3. **Keep dialogue natural** - Write how people actually speak
4. **Use white space effectively** - Don't crowd the page
5. **Number scenes consistently** - Help production track progress
6. **Include timing notes** - Especially for commercials and tight formats
7. **Mark revisions clearly** - Use color coding or version numbers
8. **Write for the ear** - Read dialogue aloud to test naturalness
9. **Be production-aware** - Consider feasibility of what you're scripting
10. **Stay format-consistent** - Don't switch formatting styles mid-script

## Tips for Success

- Use scriptwriting software like Final Draft, Celtx, or Fade In
- Study scripts from your video type to understand conventions
- Include page numbers for production reference
- Use scene numbers for tracking during shooting
- Keep action lines concise and visual
- Avoid camera directions unless absolutely necessary
- Include relevant production notes in separate section
- Time your script by reading aloud (1 page ≈ 1 minute)
- Get feedback from production team before finalizing
- Maintain a consistent voice and tone throughout
