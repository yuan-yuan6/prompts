# Brand Strategy Development Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to develop and implement a comprehensive brand strategy covering positioning, identity, messaging, brand experience, rollout planning, and measurement.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess brand strategy development readiness for [BRAND_NAME] targeting [TARGET_MARKET] with budget [BRAND_BUDGET] over [TIMELINE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategic clarity & positioning, (2) Audience insight & competitive context, (3) Identity/messaging system, (4) Experience & touchpoint design, (5) Implementation & governance, (6) Measurement & iteration. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategic Clarity & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: Purpose and positioning unclear; differentiation weak.
- 3 — Defined: Positioning, promise, and differentiators documented; architecture decisions explicit.
- 5 — Optimized: Positioning is defended with proof; strategy scales across portfolio and markets.

### 2) Audience Insight & Competitive Context
- 1 — Initial: Minimal research; competitive frame unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Personas and segments; category definition; competitor benchmarking.
- 5 — Optimized: Insight pipeline exists; segmentation and benchmarking refreshed regularly.

### 3) Identity/Messaging System
- 1 — Initial: Visual and verbal identity inconsistent; templates missing.
- 3 — Defined: Identity guidelines, voice/tone, message pillars, proof points.
- 5 — Optimized: Modular system supports many formats; governance maintains quality at speed.

### 4) Experience & Touchpoint Design
- 1 — Initial: Experience inconsistent; touchpoints not prioritized.
- 3 — Defined: Priority journeys and touchpoints mapped; standards applied.
- 5 — Optimized: Experience is measured and improved; coherence holds end-to-end.

### 5) Implementation & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Rollout plan unclear; ownership and approvals ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Phased rollout; decision rights; enablement and training.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model scales; governance enables speed; drift is monitored.

### 6) Measurement & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: Measurement sporadic; no feedback loop.
- 3 — Defined: Brand health KPIs and cadence; reporting; action tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement ties to business outcomes; iteration is continuous and controlled.

## Deliverables
- Brand strategy readiness scorecard with prioritized gaps
- Positioning, architecture, and messaging summary
- Identity system outline (visual + verbal) and templates
- Touchpoint plan and rollout roadmap
- Governance model and measurement framework

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Target market/segments
- [BRAND_BUDGET]: Budget
- [TIMELINE]: Timeline
- [CHANNEL_COUNT]: Channels to activate
- [MARKET_COUNT]: Markets/regions

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Healthcare provider network standardizing identity across regions
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Insight 2; System 2; Experience 2; Governance 3; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Weak templates; inconsistent touchpoint standards; limited measurement cadence
- 90-day priorities: Define messaging + templates; prioritize touchpoints; establish governance and brand health reporting
