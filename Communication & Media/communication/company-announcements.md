# Company Announcements & All-Hands Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to deliver **clear, credible, and aligned company-wide announcements** that inform, inspire, and drive action. Use this to diagnose gaps in message discipline, cascade execution, and feedback integration.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **company announcement readiness** for {ANNOUNCEMENT_CONTEXT}. The communication objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a company announcements & all-hands readiness assessment for {ANNOUNCEMENT_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (employee understanding, trust scores, rumor frequency, action follow-through).

**1) MESSAGE CLARITY & FRAMING**
- Headline and "why this matters" are upfront (SCQA: Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)
- Key messages are simple, memorable, and consistent across channels
- Assumptions, tradeoffs, and "what's not changing" are stated explicitly
- Jargon and ambiguity are minimized for all audience levels

**2) AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION & TAILORING**
- Messaging is segmented by impact (all-company vs. function-specific)
- Leaders, managers, and front-line employees get appropriate detail
- Remote, distributed, and shift workers receive equitable access
- Multilingual and accessibility needs are addressed

**3) CASCADE & AMPLIFICATION DISCIPLINE**
- Leaders are briefed 24–48 hours before the announcement to prepare
- Managers receive talking points, FAQs, and guidance for team conversations
- Cascade timeline is tight (24–48 hours) to prevent rumor spread
- Executive visibility and reinforcement happen consistently post-announcement

**4) CHANNEL STRATEGY & DELIVERY**
- Channel mix matches audience preference (live, video, email, intranet, Slack)
- Timing avoids major conflicts (holidays, end-of-quarter, competitive events)
- Format is appropriate for message sensitivity and interaction needs
- All-hands or town halls include Q&A and are recorded for asynchronous access

**5) TWO-WAY DIALOGUE & FEEDBACK**
- Q&A is structured with pre-submitted and live questions
- Anonymous feedback channels exist and are monitored
- Follow-up on unanswered questions happens within 48 hours
- Feedback themes inform message iteration and next communications

**6) FOLLOW-THROUGH & MEASUREMENT**
- Action items have owners, timelines, and are tracked
- Progress updates are scheduled and delivered on time
- Effectiveness is measured (reach, comprehension, sentiment, behavior change)
- Lessons learned inform future announcement improvements

---

## Required Output Format (6 Deliverables)

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity level, trust/alignment risks, and key improvement priorities

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table with score (1–5) + 1–2 findings per dimension

3) **ANNOUNCEMENT AUDIT**
- Recent announcements reviewed (3–5 examples): topic, reach, comprehension, sentiment
- Common failure modes (unclear asks, poor cascade, rumor spread)

4) **CASCADE PLAYBOOK**
- Timeline: leader brief → manager prep → all-company → team conversations
- Artifacts: talking points, FAQs, manager guide, follow-up plan

5) **CHANNEL & TIMING GUIDE**
- Recommended channels by announcement type and audience
- Optimal timing windows and conflict avoidance rules

6) **30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- Actions to improve message clarity, cascade discipline, and feedback integration
- Metrics (reach, comprehension, trust, action completion)

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (reactive, inconsistent, rumors widespread, low trust)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic structure, gaps in cascade and follow-through)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (repeatable process, solid execution, trust building)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (proactive, high trust, measured effectiveness, continuous improvement)
- 5.0: Optimized (anticipates needs, builds culture, high alignment, minimal friction)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {ANNOUNCEMENT_CONTEXT}: Org size, announcement types/frequency, current channels, past effectiveness
- {OBJECTIVES}: Trust, alignment, action completion, and comprehension goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Time, access, tools, sensitivities, geographic/cultural factors

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {ANNOUNCEMENT_CONTEXT}: 800-person SaaS company (3 offices + 40% remote). Monthly all-hands + ad hoc major announcements (6/year). Channels: Zoom, Slack, email. Last employee survey: 58% trust leadership communication; 45% "often hear rumors before official news".
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase trust in leadership communication to 75%, reduce "rumor first" to <20%, achieve 90% comprehension on major changes within 48 hours.
- {CONSTRAINTS}: CEO available 1x/month for all-hands; managers get 30 minutes prep time; no budget for new tools; 3 time zones.

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.6 (Developing)
- Trust risk: 45% hear rumors first; managers unprepared; follow-through inconsistent
- Top improvements: (1) brief managers 24 hours early with FAQs, (2) tighten cascade timeline, (3) track action commitments

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Message Clarity & Framing: 3/5 — headline clear but "why now" often missing
- Audience Segmentation: 2/5 — one-size messaging; remote teams feel afterthought
- Cascade & Amplification: 2/5 — managers learn with everyone; no talking points
- Channel Strategy: 3/5 — Zoom + Slack works; timing conflicts common
- Two-Way Dialogue: 3/5 — Q&A exists but follow-up spotty
- Follow-Through & Measurement: 2/5 — action items not tracked; no effectiveness metrics

**3) ANNOUNCEMENT AUDIT**
- Announcement 1 (reorg): reach 95%, comprehension 60%, sentiment negative (managers surprised, teams anxious)
- Announcement 2 (new product launch): reach 85%, comprehension 75%, sentiment positive (excitement high but details vague)
- Announcement 3 (policy change): reach 70%, comprehension 50%, sentiment confused (remote workers missed live session; FAQ incomplete)
- Common failure modes: managers unprepared (3/3), action follow-up missing (2/3), rumors spread before official news (2/3)

**4) CASCADE PLAYBOOK**
- T-48h: CEO briefs exec team + board (confidential context, decision rationale)
- T-24h: Execs brief managers with talking points, FAQs, and team conversation guide
- T-0: CEO delivers all-hands (Zoom live + recorded); Slack message + email summary sent
- T+4h: Managers hold team conversations using talking points; escalate questions
- T+48h: CEO or comms follows up on unanswered questions; publishes FAQ update
- Artifacts: 1-pager for managers (headline, why now, impact, FAQs, conversation starters), action tracker with owners

**5) CHANNEL & TIMING GUIDE**
- Major strategic announcements: live all-hands (Zoom) + recorded + email summary + Slack post
- Policy/process changes: email + Slack + intranet article + manager cascade
- Good news (wins, launches): Slack-first + optional all-hands segment
- Sensitive (layoffs, crisis): live all-hands + 1-on-1s for impacted + FAQ microsite
- Optimal timing: Tuesdays or Wednesdays 10am PT (8am–1pm ET window); avoid Fridays, month-end, holidays
- Conflict avoidance: check product launch calendar, board meeting dates, major customer events

**6) 30/60/90-DAY IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
- 30 days: implement 24h manager pre-brief with FAQs for all major announcements; track action commitments in shared doc
- 60 days: launch post-announcement pulse survey (3 questions: clarity, sentiment, action understanding); analyze themes
- 90 days: publish cascade playbook; train managers on team conversation facilitation; establish quarterly announcement calendar
- Metrics: trust in leadership comms (goal 75%), "rumor first" (goal <20%), comprehension within 48h (goal 90%), action completion (goal 80%)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Start with the headline and "why this matters"—never bury the lead.
2) Brief managers 24–48 hours early so they can prepare for team questions.
3) Keep the cascade tight (24–48 hours) to prevent rumors from filling the void.
4) Segment messaging: all-company context + function-specific implications.
5) Make Q&A inclusive: pre-submitted, live, and anonymous options.
6) Follow up on unanswered questions within 48 hours; publish updated FAQ.
7) Track action commitments with owners and timelines; report progress.
8) Measure effectiveness (reach, comprehension, sentiment) and iterate based on feedback.
