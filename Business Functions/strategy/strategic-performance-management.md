# Performance Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your organization can define, measure, and act on performance metrics consistently. This emphasizes strategy alignment, data quality, review rituals, and accountability.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess performance management readiness for [ORGANIZATION] in [INDUSTRY]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Strategy-to-metric alignment, (2) Metric definitions & data quality, (3) Target setting & thresholds, (4) Review cadence & accountability, (5) Tooling & reporting, (6) Incentives & culture. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, and a 60–90 day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Strategy-to-Metric Alignment
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are abundant but not tied to strategic outcomes; teams optimize locally.
- 3 — Defined: Clear linkage from objectives to a small metric set; owners are assigned.
- 5 — Optimized: Metrics drive consistent decisions and tradeoffs; metric set is continuously refined.

### 2) Metric Definitions & Data Quality
- 1 — Initial: KPI definitions vary; data sources are unclear; manual reporting is common.
- 3 — Defined: KPI glossary and owners; reconciled sources; basic data quality checks.
- 5 — Optimized: Trusted data products; automated quality monitoring; strong traceability from source to dashboard.

### 3) Target Setting & Thresholds
- 1 — Initial: Targets are arbitrary or negotiated; thresholds are inconsistent across teams.
- 3 — Defined: Targets based on baselines and benchmarks; clear thresholds and variance logic.
- 5 — Optimized: Targets reflect strategy and capacity; leading indicators guide early intervention.

### 4) Review Cadence & Accountability
- 1 — Initial: Reviews are irregular; discussions are anecdotal; actions are not tracked.
- 3 — Defined: Fixed cadence; action logs and owners; escalation for persistent misses.
- 5 — Optimized: Fast decision loops; learning captured; accountability is consistent and fair.

### 5) Tooling & Reporting
- 1 — Initial: Dashboards are fragmented; reporting is slow; stakeholders do not trust the numbers.
- 3 — Defined: Standard dashboards by level; role-based views; documentation for metrics.
- 5 — Optimized: Self-service where appropriate; reliable performance; clear storytelling and decision support.

### 6) Incentives & Culture
- 1 — Initial: Metrics are used for blame; teams hide issues; incentives conflict with metrics.
- 3 — Defined: Balanced scorecards; psychological safety improving; incentives reviewed for alignment.
- 5 — Optimized: Culture supports transparency and improvement; incentives reinforce desired behaviors.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- KPI glossary template (definition, owner, source, refresh cadence)
- Recommended metric set by organizational level
- Review cadence design (weekly/monthly/quarterly) with action tracking
- 60–90 day plan to improve trust and decision impact

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [INDUSTRY]: Industry context
- [STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES]: Top objectives the system must track
- [KPI_SET]: Candidate KPIs and owners
- [REVIEW_CADENCE]: Review cadence (weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- [TOOLS]: BI and data stack used for reporting

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Retailer aligning store ops and e-commerce performance
- Scores (1–5): Alignment 2; Data 2; Targets 3; Cadence 2; Tooling 3; Culture 2
- Top gaps: KPI definitions inconsistent, manual reporting, no action tracking
- 60–90 day priorities: Build KPI glossary; automate key extracts; establish weekly review + action log; align incentives to balanced outcomes
