# Performance Reviews Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to run performance reviews that are fair, efficient, and useful for development, compensation decisions, and organizational alignment.

## Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess performance review readiness for [ORGANIZATION] for cycle [REVIEW_CYCLE]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goals & expectations, (2) Evidence & feedback quality, (3) Review workflow execution, (4) Calibration & fairness, (5) Employee development actions, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a cycle improvement plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goals & Expectations
- 1 — Initial: Expectations unclear; reviews feel surprising.
- 3 — Defined: Goals and expectations are documented and reviewed during cycle.
- 5 — Optimized: Goals align to strategy; expectations are consistent and measurable.

### 2) Evidence & Feedback Quality
- 1 — Initial: Feedback is vague; evidence missing.
- 3 — Defined: Feedback uses examples; evidence gathered across cycle.
- 5 — Optimized: Feedback quality is high; bias reduced; clarity improves outcomes.

### 3) Review Workflow Execution
- 1 — Initial: Execution is inconsistent; deadlines slip.
- 3 — Defined: Clear workflow with deadlines; reminders and tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Execution is predictable; cycle completes smoothly at scale.

### 4) Calibration & Fairness
- 1 — Initial: Ratings vary widely by manager; fairness concerns.
- 3 — Defined: Calibration sessions and guidelines; documentation standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Calibration improves fairness; distributions are monitored and understood.

### 5) Employee Development Actions
- 1 — Initial: Reviews don’t translate into development actions.
- 3 — Defined: Development actions identified; follow-up plans and resources.
- 5 — Optimized: Development is executed and measured; mobility and skills improve.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No retrospectives; same issues repeat each cycle.
- 3 — Defined: Cycle KPIs tracked and reviewed; improvements prioritized.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement reduces friction and increases perceived value.

## Deliverables
- Performance review readiness scorecard and gap list
- Review cycle execution plan and timeline
- Feedback quality guidance and examples
- Calibration plan and fairness checks
- Post-review development action plan and tracking

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [REVIEW_CYCLE]: Review cycle name/date
- [RATING_SCALE]: Rating model
- [CALIBRATION]: Calibration approach
- [DEVELOPMENT_ACTIONS]: Actions per employee
- [CYCLE_KPIS]: Completion, cycle time, distribution

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Annual reviews with low trust and poor follow-through
- Scores (1–5): Expectations 2; Feedback 2; Execution 3; Fairness 2; Development 2; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Improve feedback training; strengthen calibration; add post-review development tracking and retrospectives
