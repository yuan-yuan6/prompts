# Debt Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to pay down debt across six dimensions: debt clarity, cashflow control, strategy selection, creditor optimization, behavior safeguards, and tracking/support.

## Template

Conduct a debt management readiness assessment for {DEBT_SNAPSHOT} with goals {PAYOFF_GOALS} and constraints {CONSTRAINTS}.

Score each dimension 1–5:

**1) DEBT INVENTORY & CLARITY**
- Complete list of debts (balance, APR, minimum, due date, status)
- Understanding of fees, penalties, and promotional rates
- Awareness of collections/legal risk if relevant

**2) CASHFLOW & BUDGET CONTROL**
- Stable plan for minimum payments (no missed payments)
- Budget identifies free cashflow for payoff
- Irregular expenses accounted for (prevents “oops” months)

**3) PAYOFF STRATEGY FIT**
- Strategy chosen intentionally (avalanche vs snowball vs hybrid)
- Consolidation/refinance considered with clear pros/cons
- Plan includes emergency buffer to prevent re-borrowing

**4) CREDITOR OPTIMIZATION**
- Ability to negotiate APR/fees or request hardship plans (where appropriate)
- Understanding of balance transfer terms and risks
- Autopay and due-date alignment set

**5) BEHAVIOR & SAFEGUARDS**
- Spending triggers recognized (stress, convenience, social)
- Rules to prevent new debt (freeze cards, caps, alternate payment methods)
- Contingency plan for setbacks (income drop, surprise expense)

**6) TRACKING & SUPPORT**
- Weekly tracking of balances and payments
- Accountability mechanism (partner, coach, friend, spreadsheet/app)
- Progress celebration without self-sabotage

## Required Output Format

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Maturity level (per scale below)
- Top 3 priorities for the next 2 weeks

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- Table: dimension | score (/5) | key evidence | primary fix

3) **DEBT PORTFOLIO READINESS**
- Table for each debt: status (OK / Risky), next action, payoff approach

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Top 5 gaps ranked by impact × urgency

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Days 1–7: stabilization actions
- Month 1–3: payoff targets, negotiation/consolidation steps, safeguard steps

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- Baseline vs 30/60/90-day targets: on-time payments, total balance, interest paid, utilization, emergency buffer

---

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (missed payments likely, unclear inventory)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some plan, fragile execution)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (stable payments and chosen strategy)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (consistent payoff, safeguards in place)
- 5.0: Optimized (debt-free path, strong financial resilience)

## Variables (max 3)

| Variable | What to provide | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| {DEBT_SNAPSHOT} | Balances/APRs/mins | “$6k @ 24%, $3k @ 18%, $12k student @ 5%” |
| {PAYOFF_GOALS} | Outcomes + timeline | “No card debt in 12 months; never miss payments” |
| {CONSTRAINTS} | Limits to respect | “$400/month extra; income variable; no new loans” |

---

## Example (filled)

**Input**
- {DEBT_SNAPSHOT}: Credit card A $6,200 @ 24% min $185; card B $2,900 @ 18% min $95; personal loan $5,000 @ 10% min $160
- {PAYOFF_GOALS}: Stop paying interest spirals; be card-debt-free in 12 months
- {CONSTRAINTS}: Can add $350/month; income stable; wants simple plan

**Output**

1) **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall readiness score: 3.2/5
- Maturity level: Defined
- Top 3 priorities (2 weeks): (1) stabilize payments via autopay, (2) choose avalanche payoff, (3) implement card safeguards

2) **DIMENSION SCORECARD**
| Dimension | Score | Key evidence | Primary fix |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Debt Inventory & Clarity | 4.0 | Balances/APRs/mins are known | Add due dates and promo terms |
| Cashflow & Budget Control | 3.0 | Extra $350 available | Account for irregulars |
| Payoff Strategy Fit | 3.5 | Open to avalanche | Define buffer target |
| Creditor Optimization | 2.5 | No calls made yet | Ask for APR reduction and due-date alignment |
| Behavior & Safeguards | 2.5 | Cards still used casually | Freeze cards and set caps |
| Tracking & Support | 3.5 | Will track weekly | Add a simple dashboard |

3) **DEBT PORTFOLIO READINESS**
- Card A (24%): Risky — next action: pay minimum + direct all extra here; request APR reduction
- Card B (18%): OK — next action: pay minimum; roll over after Card A done
- Loan (10%): OK — next action: autopay; don’t accelerate until high-APR handled

4) **GAP ANALYSIS**
- Gap 1: Irregular expenses break plan → no buffer → create a small monthly sinking fund
- Gap 2: High APR persists → no negotiation → call issuer and request APR reduction
- Gap 3: New charges sabotage payoff → weak safeguards → freeze card usage and remove from wallets
- Gap 4: Motivation drops → no milestones → set 30/60/90-day targets
- Gap 5: Tracking lags → unclear progress → weekly balance check-in

5) **90-DAY PLAN**
- Days 1–7: set autopay minimums; list due dates; call issuers; freeze cards; create $300 starter buffer
- Month 1: pay minimums + $350 extra to Card A; track weekly
- Month 2: continue avalanche; adjust discretionary caps
- Month 3: re-check APR outcomes; consider balance transfer only if terms are clearly favorable

6) **SUCCESS METRICS**
- On-time payments: 100% monthly
- Total balance: $14,100 → $12,700 by day 90
- Interest paid: reduce by ≥15%
- Credit utilization: decrease month-over-month
- Emergency buffer: $0 → $500

## Best Practices (exactly 8)

1) **Stabilize before optimizing** — never miss minimum payments.
2) **Pick one payoff strategy** — run avalanche/snowball for 90 days before changing.
3) **Build a small buffer** — prevents re-borrowing during surprises.
4) **Reduce APR when possible** — negotiation and refinancing can matter.
5) **Remove temptation** — freeze cards and reduce easy access to credit.
6) **Track weekly, not daily** — consistent visibility beats obsession.
7) **Plan for setbacks** — define what you do when income drops.
8) **Celebrate milestones safely** — reward progress without spending sprees.
