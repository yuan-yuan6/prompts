## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does a systematic review take?**
A: Typically 6-18 months for a complete systematic review, depending on scope, team size, and literature volume. Rapid reviews can be completed in 2-4 months with streamlined methods.

**Q: Do I need to use all five modules?**
A: Not necessarily. Use modules based on your specific needs. For example, if updating an existing review, you may only need Modules 1-2 (search and selection) and Module 5 (reporting).

**Q: What's the difference between a systematic review and a meta-analysis?**
A: A systematic review is a comprehensive synthesis of all available evidence using transparent methods. A meta-analysis is a statistical technique that may be used within a systematic review to pool quantitative results.

**Q: How many databases should I search?**
A: Minimum 2-3 major databases for most fields. More comprehensive reviews search 5+ databases plus grey literature. See Module 1 for database selection guidance.

**Q: Is protocol registration required?**
A: Not always required, but strongly recommended for transparency. PROSPERO is standard for health-related reviews. Required by many journals and funders.

**Q: How many reviewers do I need?**
A: Minimum 2 independent reviewers for screening and quality assessment. Some processes (data extraction) can be single-reviewer with verification.

**Q: Should I include grey literature?**
A: Yes, to minimize publication bias, but assess quality carefully. See Module 1 for grey literature sources and Module 2 for quality assessment.

**Q: When should I conduct subgroup analyses?**
A: Pre-specify in protocol based on theoretical or clinical rationale. Conduct only if sufficient studies (typically 10+). See Module 3 for detailed guidance.

**Q: How do I handle missing data?**
A: Contact study authors, use imputation methods if appropriate, conduct sensitivity analyses with/without studies with missing data. See Module 3.

**Q: What if studies are too heterogeneous to pool?**
A: Consider narrative synthesis, subgroup analyses, or meta-regression to explore heterogeneity. May choose not to pool if inappropriate. See Module 3.
