```

## Variables
- `[RECORDING_QUALITY]`: Quality level specifications
- `[MIX_SPECIFICATIONS]`: Mix requirements
- `[TECHNICAL_STANDARDS]`: Technical compliance requirements
- `[EQUIPMENT_NEEDS]`: Required equipment
- `[STUDIO_REQUIREMENTS]`: Studio specifications
- `[SAMPLE_RATE]`: Sample rate (e.g., 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz)
- `[BIT_DEPTH]`: Bit depth (e.g., 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit)
- `[CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION]`: Channel setup (stereo, 5.1, etc.)

## Best Practices
1. **Plan before recording** - Prepare technical setup in advance
2. **Use quality equipment** - Invest in good microphones and preamps
3. **Control the environment** - Ensure proper acoustic treatment
4. **Monitor carefully** - Use quality headphones/monitors for accurate assessment
5. **Document settings** - Keep detailed notes on all technical parameters
6. **Capture multiple takes** - Record options for later selection
7. **Stay organized** - Use clear file naming and project organization
8. **Think ahead** - Record with mixing and mastering in mind
