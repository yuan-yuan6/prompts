# Best Practices & Standards Documentation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether you’re ready to create and sustain a standards/best-practices program by scoring six dimensions: Scope & Outcomes, Standards Taxonomy, Evidence & Validation, Governance & Compliance, Authoring & Quality, and Rollout & Improvement. Use this as a **go / revise-first** gate before publishing a large standards library.

## 🚀 Quick Prompt

> Assess **standards & best practices documentation readiness** for **{STANDARDS_CONTEXT}** covering **{FUNCTION_AND_SCOPE}** under **{REGULATORY_AND_CONSTRAINTS}**. Score each dimension 1–5 with brief evidence: (1) scope & outcomes, (2) standards taxonomy, (3) evidence & validation, (4) governance & compliance, (5) authoring & quality, (6) rollout & continuous improvement. Provide an overall maturity level, a go/revise-first recommendation, top risks, and a prioritized 30–60 day implementation plan.

## Template

Conduct a best practices & standards documentation readiness assessment for {STANDARDS_CONTEXT} covering {FUNCTION_AND_SCOPE} under {REGULATORY_AND_CONSTRAINTS}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. SCOPE & OUTCOMES READINESS**
Evaluate whether the program has a clear mission, boundaries, and measurable outcomes. Confirm what problems the standards solve (quality, safety, compliance, efficiency), who must follow them, and what success metrics you’ll track.

**2. STANDARDS TAXONOMY READINESS**
Evaluate whether you can classify and prioritize standards: hierarchy (policy/standard/procedure/work instruction), mandatory vs recommended, and criticality. Confirm naming conventions and how standards map to processes.

**3. EVIDENCE & VALIDATION READINESS**
Evaluate whether standards are credible and fit-for-purpose: sources (internal performance, incidents, audits, benchmarking), validation steps (SME review, pilots), and criteria for adoption. Confirm you can defend why each standard exists.

**4. GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE READINESS**
Evaluate decision rights, approvals, exception handling, and auditability. Confirm review cycles, change control, access controls, and how regulatory requirements are reflected in the documentation.

**5. AUTHORING & QUALITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether standards will be consistent, readable, and maintainable: templates, required sections, writing style, examples, and accessibility where relevant. Confirm you have a “definition of done” and quality checks.

**6. ROLLOUT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT READINESS**
Evaluate whether standards will be adopted and improved: rollout plan, training/enablement, communication, monitoring, and feedback loops. Confirm you can measure compliance and evolve standards without churn.

## Required Output Format

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, go/revise-first, top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table: dimension, score (1–5), evidence, biggest gap, highest-impact fix

3. **STANDARDS PROGRAM BLUEPRINT (ONE PAGE)**
- Mission + scope (in/out)
- Taxonomy + mandatory/recommended split
- Governance: roles, approvals, review cadence
- Validation approach + evidence requirements
- Compliance monitoring approach

4. **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (30–60 DAYS)**
- Week 1–2: foundation (taxonomy, templates, governance)
- Week 3–4: draft 3–5 critical standards + validation
- Week 5–8: rollout + training + monitoring

5. **RISKS & MITIGATIONS (TOP 5)** - Over-scoping, low adoption, weak evidence, governance bottlenecks, audit gaps

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Initial:** Ad-hoc guidance; inconsistent enforcement; unclear ownership.
- **2 — Developing:** Some standards exist; gaps in taxonomy, validation, or monitoring.
- **3 — Defined:** Clear program blueprint; initial standards drafted; ready to pilot.
- **4 — Managed:** Standards are governed, adopted, and audited; measured outcomes improve.
- **5 — Optimized:** Continuous improvement loop; evidence-driven updates; high trust and compliance.

## Variables (Use Max 3)

| Variable | What to include | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{STANDARDS_CONTEXT}` | Org + maturity + environment | “Municipal agency with mixed legacy processes” |
| `{FUNCTION_AND_SCOPE}` | Function + processes covered | “Facilities maintenance: work orders, safety checks, vendor mgmt” |
| `{REGULATORY_AND_CONSTRAINTS}` | Regulations + constraints | “OSHA + local policy; limited training time; union rules” |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- `{STANDARDS_CONTEXT}`: “Community college operations team.”
- `{FUNCTION_AND_SCOPE}`: “IT service desk: ticket triage, password resets, incident escalation.”
- `{REGULATORY_AND_CONSTRAINTS}`: “FERPA + internal IT policy; 24/7 coverage; high turnover.”

**Output (abridged)**
- Executive summary: 2.8/5 (Developing), **revise-first**
- Biggest gaps: no taxonomy; approvals unclear; monitoring is informal
- Next actions (30 days): define hierarchy + naming; pick 5 critical standards (triage, escalation, access control, comms, documentation); create template with required sections; appoint owner + review cadence; pilot for 2 weeks; add simple audit checklist and KPI dashboard
