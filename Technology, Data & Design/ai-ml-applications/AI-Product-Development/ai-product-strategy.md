# AI Product Strategy Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to define and execute an AI product strategy, including value hypotheses, data/model constraints, governance, and go-to-market alignment.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess AI product strategy readiness for [PRODUCT] targeting [USE_CASES] and [CUSTOMERS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Problem/value clarity, (2) Data and feasibility, (3) Differentiation and positioning, (4) Governance and risk, (5) Delivery and operating model, (6) Measurement and iteration. Provide a scorecard and a 90-day strategy execution plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Problem & Value Clarity
- 1 — Initial: AI is added opportunistically; outcomes unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Target user problems and measurable success metrics defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Portfolio managed by value; outcomes measured and optimized.

### 2) Data & Feasibility
- 1 — Initial: Data availability/quality unknown; feasibility unproven.
- 3 — Defined: Data sources inventoried; feasibility validated with prototypes.
- 5 — Optimized: Feasibility is repeatable; constraints managed proactively.

### 3) Differentiation & Positioning
- 1 — Initial: No clear differentiation; messaging is generic.
- 3 — Defined: Positioning and value narrative defined; competitive analysis done.
- 5 — Optimized: Differentiation is sustained with evidence and product learning loops.

### 4) Governance & Risk
- 1 — Initial: Safety and compliance are afterthoughts.
- 3 — Defined: Risk controls and approvals defined; policies documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Governance scales with shipping velocity; audits and monitoring in place.

### 5) Delivery & Operating Model
- 1 — Initial: Teams and responsibilities unclear; delivery ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Roles, roadmap, and delivery process defined; ownership set.
- 5 — Optimized: Operating model supports fast iteration and reliable delivery.

### 6) Measurement & Iteration
- 1 — Initial: No measurement; success defined by anecdotes.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs and feedback loops defined; experimentation cadence exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous optimization improves outcomes, cost, and user experience.

## Deliverables
- AI product strategy readiness scorecard and gap list
- Use case portfolio with success metrics and prioritization rationale
- Feasibility and data constraints assessment
- Governance and risk controls checklist
- 90-day roadmap and measurement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [PRODUCT]: Product name
- [USE_CASES]: Target use cases
- [CUSTOMERS]: Target customers/segments
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: Success metrics
- [DATA_SOURCES]: Data sources
- [RISK_LEVEL]: Risk level

## Example (Condensed)
- Product: B2B SaaS adding an AI assistant for onboarding
- Scores (1–5): Value 3; Feasibility 2; Positioning 3; Governance 2; Delivery 3; Iteration 2
- 90-day priorities: Validate feasibility and data; define governance gates; instrument KPIs and ship a pilot
