# Fitness Planning Template

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive fitness plans including workout programs, exercise routines, and health tracking systems to achieve physical fitness goals and maintain long-term wellness.

## Quick Start

Launch your fitness journey in 3 steps:

1. **Assess Your Starting Point** - Honestly evaluate:
   - Current fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Available time for exercise (realistic weekly commitment)
   - Physical limitations or injuries
   - Access to equipment (gym, home equipment, bodyweight only)

2. **Set Core Variables** - Define these key elements:
   - `FITNESS_PLAN_TYPE`: Your focus (e.g., "Weight loss program", "Strength building")
   - `FITNESS_LEVEL`: Current experience level
   - `FITNESS_GOALS`: 1-2 specific, measurable goals (e.g., "Lose 15 pounds", "Run 5K")
   - `EXERCISE_APPROACH`: Your preferred method (e.g., "Gym workouts", "Home bodyweight")
   - `PLAN_DURATION`: Realistic timeframe (recommend 8-12 weeks for first phase)

3. **Start with Consistency Over Intensity** - Week 1 action plan:
   - Schedule 3 workout days at specific times
   - Start with 30-minute sessions
   - Focus on proper form over heavy weights or speed
   - Track completion (not perfection)

**Pro Tip**: The best workout program is one you'll actually do. Start with 3 days per week for 30 minutes. Build the habit first, then increase intensity and duration.
