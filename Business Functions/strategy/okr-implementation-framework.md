# OKR Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether an organization is ready to implement OKRs in a way that improves focus, alignment, and execution rather than creating reporting overhead.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess OKR readiness for [ORGANIZATION] across [TEAM_COUNT] teams on a [CYCLE_LENGTH] cycle. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Objective quality & focus, (2) Key result measurement & data, (3) Alignment & dependency management, (4) Cadence and rituals, (5) Tooling & transparency, (6) Leadership & culture. Provide a scorecard with evidence, top gaps, and a 60–90 day rollout plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objective Quality & Focus
- 1 — Initial: Objectives are too many, vague, or task lists; priorities change frequently.
- 3 — Defined: Objectives are few, outcome-oriented, and time-bound; focus is protected.
- 5 — Optimized: Objectives drive tradeoffs; teams can explain why each objective matters; scope creep is controlled.

### 2) Key Result Measurement & Data
- 1 — Initial: Key results are not measurable or rely on manual updates; baselines are missing.
- 3 — Defined: Most KRs have clear definitions and sources; baselines and targets are documented.
- 5 — Optimized: KRs are instrumented with reliable data; update burden is low; measurement improves learning.

### 3) Alignment & Dependency Management
- 1 — Initial: OKRs are cascaded mechanically; dependencies are discovered late.
- 3 — Defined: Alignment is negotiated; dependencies are explicit; cross-team coordination exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Shared objectives where appropriate; dependency risks are managed proactively; alignment reduces conflict.

### 4) Cadence and Rituals
- 1 — Initial: Check-ins are inconsistent; reviews are superficial; learning is not captured.
- 3 — Defined: Fixed weekly check-ins and quarterly reviews; retrospectives improve the process.
- 5 — Optimized: Rituals are lightweight and decision-oriented; course correction happens early.

### 5) Tooling & Transparency
- 1 — Initial: Tooling is inconsistent; OKRs are hard to find; status is not trusted.
- 3 — Defined: A single source for OKRs; standard status definitions; visibility by default.
- 5 — Optimized: Tooling supports analytics and reuse; dashboards show alignment and progress with minimal effort.

### 6) Leadership & Culture
- 1 — Initial: OKRs are used for compensation or blame; teams sandbag; psychological safety is low.
- 3 — Defined: Leaders reinforce learning and focus; stretch is understood; accountability is fair.
- 5 — Optimized: Culture supports ambition and transparency; leaders model good OKRs; teams improve KR quality over time.

## Deliverables
- OKR readiness scorecard (1–5) with evidence notes
- Recommended OKR structure (levels, number of objectives, KR standards)
- Cadence design (check-ins, reviews, retrospectives)
- Rollout plan (training, pilot scope, governance)
- Success metrics (alignment, completion quality, cycle-time of decisions)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)


## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization being assessed
- [TEAM_COUNT]: Number of teams in scope
- [CYCLE_LENGTH]: OKR cycle length (quarterly/annual)
- [OKR_LEVELS]: Levels used (company, department, team)
- [TOOLS]: OKR tooling (sheet, wiki, system)

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: 200-person product company moving from annual goals to quarterly OKRs
- Scores (1–5): Objectives 3; Measurement 2; Alignment 2; Cadence 2; Tooling 3; Culture 2
- Top gaps: Manual KR updates, unclear dependencies, fear of stretch goals
- 60–90 day priorities: Define KR measurement standards; pilot with 2–3 teams; implement weekly check-ins; train leaders on non-compensation usage
