## Usage Example
Use for developing sourcing strategies, building employer brand, launching recruitment campaigns, creating talent pipelines, or differentiating from competitors.

## Best Practices
- **Start with employee referrals, not job boards** - Referred candidates are 55% faster to hire and stay 70% longer
- **Test your employer brand with exit interviews** - Departing employees will tell you the truth about your reputation
- **Track source-of-hire by quality, not just volume** - A channel generating 100 applicants but zero hires wastes time
- **Build pipeline before you need it** - Start sourcing 6 months before anticipated openings for senior roles
- **Personalize outreach with specific details** - "I saw your talk on [topic]" gets 3x more responses than generic messages
