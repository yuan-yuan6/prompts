4. **Set images to 300 DPI minimum** - Ensure sharp reproduction
5. **Create master pages** - Maintain consistency across multi-page documents
6. **Build in color** - Use rich blacks and avoid registration issues
7. **Proof multiple times** - Check digital proof, hard proof, and press sheet
8. **Communicate with printer** - Verify specifications before finalizing
9. **Archive properly** - Save all fonts, links, and native files
10. **Test fold and binding** - Create physical mockups when possible

## Tips for Success

- Request printer specifications before starting design
- Build files with appropriate bleed and trim marks
- Use appropriate resolution for final output size
- Consider paper color and texture in design decisions
- Create color swatches for consistency
- Organize layers and name them clearly
- Package files with all fonts and links
