# HR Performance Management Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to manage employee performance with clear expectations, coaching, fair evaluations, and measurable development outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess performance management readiness for [ORGANIZATION] with [EMPLOYEE_COUNT] employees. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Goal setting & expectations, (2) Coaching & feedback, (3) Evaluation & calibration, (4) Development planning, (5) Systems & governance, (6) Measurement & continuous improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Goal Setting & Expectations
- 1 — Initial: Goals are unclear; expectations vary by manager.
- 3 — Defined: Goal-setting cadence and standards; role expectations documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Goals align to strategy; expectations are consistent and measurable.

### 2) Coaching & Feedback
- 1 — Initial: Feedback is sporadic; coaching inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Regular 1:1s and feedback practices; manager guidance exists.
- 5 — Optimized: Coaching is embedded; feedback quality is high and timely.

### 3) Evaluation & Calibration
- 1 — Initial: Evaluations are subjective; bias risk high.
- 3 — Defined: Evaluation criteria and calibration process; documentation standards.
- 5 — Optimized: Calibration is consistent; decisions are fair and defensible.

### 4) Development Planning
- 1 — Initial: Development plans are rare; growth is ad-hoc.
- 3 — Defined: Development planning process; learning resources and paths.
- 5 — Optimized: Development is personalized and measured; internal mobility improves.

### 5) Systems & Governance
- 1 — Initial: Tools and processes are fragmented; decisions are inconsistent.
- 3 — Defined: Performance management system and governance cadence.
- 5 — Optimized: Systems scale; governance enables consistent decisions and enablement.

### 6) Measurement & Continuous Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No measurement of performance process effectiveness.
- 3 — Defined: KPIs tracked (completion rates, fairness signals, engagement).
- 5 — Optimized: Continuous improvement improves performance outcomes and manager capability.

## Deliverables
- Performance management readiness scorecard and gap list
- Goal-setting standards and templates
- Feedback and coaching guidance for managers
- Calibration and evaluation workflow
- Development planning framework and measurement plan

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [EMPLOYEE_COUNT]: Employee count
- [GOAL_FRAMEWORK]: OKRs/SMART/etc.
- [REVIEW_CADENCE]: Quarterly/biannual
- [RATING_SCALE]: Rating model
- [MANAGER_TRAINING]: Training plan

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: 500-person company with inconsistent manager practices
- Scores (1–5): Goals 2; Coaching 2; Calibration 2; Development 2; Systems 3; Improvement 2
- 90-day priorities: Standardize goals; train managers; implement calibration and development planning cadence
