# Curriculum Development & Educational Design Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design, deliver, and continuously improve a curriculum across six dimensions. Use this to identify gaps, prioritize actions, and produce a realistic implementation roadmap.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess curriculum-development readiness for **{PROGRAM_CONTEXT}** serving **{LEARNER_PROFILE}** with **{DELIVERY_MODE}** delivery.
>
> Score readiness 1–5 across six dimensions. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, prioritized recommendations, and a practical 12-month roadmap with success metrics.

---

## Readiness Dimensions (Score 1–5)

### 1) Goals & Outcomes Readiness
- Clear program purpose and audience fit
- Measurable learning outcomes (knowledge/skills/behaviors)
- Alignment to standards, credentials, or role requirements (if applicable)

### 2) Learner & Context Readiness
- Learner profile clarity (baseline, needs, constraints)
- Stakeholder alignment (faculty/instructors, sponsors, accreditors)
- Equity and accessibility needs understood (accommodations, inclusion)

### 3) Design & Content Readiness
- Instructional design approach selected (e.g., project-based, mastery)
- Content scope and sequencing (prerequisites → core → capstone)
- Resource plan (SMEs, content production, tooling, budget)

### 4) Assessment & Evidence Readiness
- Assessment strategy covers outcomes (formative + summative)
- Rubrics/criteria defined (what “good” looks like)
- Feedback loop for learners and instructors (timely, actionable)

### 5) Delivery & Operations Readiness
- Delivery model prepared (synchronous/asynchronous/hybrid)
- Instructor enablement and support (training, guides, QA)
- Operational plan (cadence, LMS, scheduling, learner support)

### 6) Governance & Improvement Readiness
- Ownership and decision rights defined
- Quality assurance and review cycle (content freshness, effectiveness)
- Metrics and iteration plan (what changes, when, based on what)

## Required Output Format

1) **Executive Summary**
- Overall readiness score (average of 6)
- Current maturity level (1–5)
- Top 3 priorities and top 3 risks

2) **Dimension Scorecard**
- Table: Dimension | Score (1–5) | Evidence | Key gap

3) **Curriculum Snapshot**
- Target audience, scope, constraints, delivery mode
- High-level pathway structure (modules / phases)

4) **Gap Analysis (Top 5)**
- Rank gaps by impact × urgency
- Provide smallest-next-step fixes

5) **Roadmap (12 months)**
- Quarterly plan across design, assessment, delivery, governance

6) **Success Metrics**
- Baseline → 6-month → 12-month targets (completion, satisfaction, outcome mastery)

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Ad hoc:** Outcomes unclear; inconsistent delivery; weak measurement.
- **2 — Emerging:** Some structure; gaps in sequencing, assessment, or operations.
- **3 — Defined:** Clear outcomes, sequence, assessments, and delivery plan.
- **4 — Managed:** Measured and consistently executed; improvements are systematic.
- **5 — Optimized:** Continuously improved; strong learning transfer and repeatability.

## Variables

| Variable | What to provide | Example |
|---|---|---|
| {PROGRAM_CONTEXT} | Program type + goal | "12-week data analytics certificate" |
| {LEARNER_PROFILE} | Who learners are + baseline | "Working adults; beginner SQL; 6–8 hrs/week" |
| {DELIVERY_MODE} | Delivery modality | "Hybrid (live weekly + async labs)" |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {PROGRAM_CONTEXT}: "12-week data analytics certificate for internal upskilling"
- {LEARNER_PROFILE}: "Customer ops team; mixed Excel proficiency; minimal SQL; limited time (4 hrs/week)"
- {DELIVERY_MODE}: "Async-first + weekly live workshop"

**Output (abridged)**
- Overall readiness: 2.9/5 (Emerging)
- Top priorities: define measurable outcomes + rubrics; simplify scope; set learner support + cadence

Scorecard highlights
- Goals & Outcomes: 3 — Objective clear; outcomes need measurable artifacts
- Learner & Context: 3 — Constraints known; accessibility needs not yet addressed
- Design & Content: 2 — Sequencing unclear; too many tools at once
- Assessment & Evidence: 2 — Assessments not mapped to outcomes
- Delivery & Operations: 3 — Delivery mode feasible; instructor enablement missing
- Governance & Improvement: 3 — Owner identified; review cycle not defined

Roadmap (high level)
- Q1: outcomes + rubric + module outline
- Q2: build 4 core modules + labs; pilot cohort
- Q3: iterate based on data; add support playbook
- Q4: scale delivery; formalize governance and refresh cycle

## Best Practices (8)
1. Make outcomes measurable via learner artifacts (projects, demos, assessments).
2. Keep scope small; sequence prerequisites explicitly.
3. Use a consistent rubric for mastery and feedback.
4. Design assessments first, then create content to support them.
5. Plan delivery operations (cadence, support, instructor enablement) early.
6. Build accessibility and inclusion into materials and evaluation.
7. Pilot with a small cohort; iterate based on evidence.
8. Establish governance: owners, review cadence, and metrics.
