# Course Foundations & Learning Objectives Designer

## Purpose
Establish the pedagogical foundation and define clear, measurable learning objectives for your course that align with institutional goals and professional standards.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: Clear, measurable learning objectives as the foundation for course design

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and academic level
- Subject area and content focus
- Target student population
- Real-world applications of the content

**5-minute starter**:
1. Complete this sentence: "By the end of this course, students will be able to..."
2. Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy (analyze, create, evaluate) not vague terms (understand, learn)
3. Write 4-6 objectives spanning different cognitive levels (some foundational, some advanced)
4. For each objective, note HOW it will be measured
5. Check that objectives are realistic for your course timeframe

**Common first use**: "Help me establish foundations for 'Digital Marketing Analytics' - undergraduate, 3-credit course for business juniors. Focus on data-driven decision making, analytics tools, campaign optimization. Students need to: analyze marketing data, use analytics platforms, make evidence-based recommendations."

**Expected output**: Educational philosophy and pedagogical approach, course mission aligned with institutional goals, 4-6 SMART learning objectives across Bloom's taxonomy levels, measurable success criteria for each objective, recommended course structure and sequencing, and identification of key success factors.

**Best for**: Starting course design, clarifying course purpose, aligning with program objectives, writing syllabi, ensuring measurability, guiding all other course design decisions.

## Template

```
You are an expert instructional designer specializing in learning theory and outcome-based education. Help me establish the foundational framework and learning objectives for a new course.

### Course Context
- Course Title: [COURSE_NAME]
- Academic Level: [LEVEL] (undergraduate/graduate/professional)
- Duration: [DURATION] (semester/quarter/weeks)
- Delivery Mode: [MODE] (in-person/online/hybrid)
- Student Profile: [STUDENT_DESCRIPTION]

### Subject Area
- Academic Discipline: [DISCIPLINE]
- Content Focus: [FOCUS_AREAS]
- Prerequisite Knowledge: [PREREQUISITES]
- Real-World Applications: [APPLICATIONS]

### Learning Goals
- Primary Outcomes: [MAIN_GOALS]
- Key Skills to Develop: [SKILLS]
- Professional Standards: [STANDARDS] (if applicable)

Based on this information, create:

## 1. EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY & PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH

### Learning Theory Foundation
Define which learning theories will guide course design:
- Constructivist, social learning, experiential, problem-based, or inquiry-based approaches
- Rationale for pedagogical choices based on subject matter and student needs
- How theory translates into practice in this course

### Student-Centered Design Principles
Establish how the course will:
- Support learner autonomy and agency
- Accommodate diverse learning preferences
- Ensure accessibility and universal design
- Integrate student voice and choice
- Address cultural responsiveness

## 2. COURSE MISSION & VISION

### Educational Purpose
Articulate what students will achieve:
- Knowledge acquisition and understanding targets
- Skill development and competency building goals
- Critical thinking and problem-solving outcomes
- Professional preparation and career readiness
- Personal growth and lifelong learning foundation

### Alignment Strategy
Show connections to:
- Institutional mission and program objectives
- Professional standards and industry requirements
- Accreditation criteria (if applicable)
- Graduate attributes and employability skills

## 3. LEARNING OBJECTIVES (BLOOM'S TAXONOMY)

### Cognitive Domain Objectives
Create 4-6 SMART learning objectives across Bloom's levels:

**Remember/Understand Level:**
- [Students will be able to define/explain/describe...]

**Apply/Analyze Level:**
- [Students will be able to apply/analyze/compare...]

**Evaluate/Create Level:**
- [Students will be able to evaluate/design/develop...]

### Affective Domain Objectives (if relevant)
Specify attitude, value, or professional identity outcomes:
- [Students will demonstrate/value/appreciate...]

### Psychomotor Domain Objectives (if relevant)
Define physical or technical skills:
- [Students will perform/demonstrate proficiency in...]

## 4. MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA

For each learning objective, define:
- **Performance Indicator**: What observable behavior demonstrates achievement
- **Standard of Performance**: What level of quality is expected
- **Conditions**: Under what circumstances students will demonstrate competency
- **Assessment Method**: How achievement will be measured

## 5. COURSE STRUCTURE FRAMEWORK

### Modular Organization
Recommend:
- Number of modules/units based on content scope
- Logical sequencing and learning progression
- Prerequisites between modules
- Time allocation for each module

### Learning Pathways
Suggest:
- Core content all students must complete
- Optional specialization or interest-based paths
- Scaffolding support for struggling learners
- Acceleration opportunities for advanced students

## 6. SUCCESS FACTORS

Identify what will make this course effective:
- Critical pedagogical approaches that align with objectives
- Essential student support mechanisms
- Key engagement strategies
- Quality indicators to monitor

Ensure all learning objectives are:
- Specific and clearly defined
- Measurable with concrete assessment criteria
- Achievable within the course timeframe
- Relevant to student needs and career goals
- Time-bound with clear milestones
- Aligned with chosen pedagogical approach
- Written using clear action verbs
```
