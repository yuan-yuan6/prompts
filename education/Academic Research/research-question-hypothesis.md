## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with general interest area, progressively refine to specific question
2. **Consult the literature** - Ground questions in existing knowledge and identified gaps
3. **Use appropriate question words** - Match question type to research approach (what, how, why)
4. **Ensure testability** - Questions and hypotheses must be empirically answerable
5. **Consider feasibility** - Be realistic about resources, access, and timeline
6. **Seek feedback** - Share with mentors, colleagues, and stakeholders
7. **Iterate and refine** - Expect to revise questions multiple times
8. **Maintain focus** - Avoid trying to answer too many questions in one study
9. **Align all elements** - Ensure coherence between problem, questions, objectives, and hypotheses
10. **Think about implications** - Consider how answers will advance knowledge or practice

## Customization Options

1. **By Research Approach**: Adapt for quantitative (hypothesis-testing), qualitative (exploratory), or mixed methods (integrated questions)

2. **By Discipline**: Customize for specific fields (education, health sciences, social sciences, business)

3. **By Study Type**: Modify for basic vs. applied research, program evaluation, or policy analysis
