## Best Practices

### Research Methodology
1. **Multiple sources** - Don't rely on single data point
2. **Primary + secondary** - Customer interviews + desk research
3. **Regular updates** - Quarterly competitive reviews minimum
4. **Objective assessment** - Honest evaluation, not wishful thinking
5. **Validation** - Cross-check competitive intelligence

### Analysis
1. **Customer perspective** - Analyze from buyer's POV
2. **Segment-specific** - Competitive landscape varies by segment
3. **Forward-looking** - Where market is going, not just where it is
4. **Actionable insights** - Every finding should inform decisions
5. **Quantify when possible** - Numbers > generalizations

### Strategy Development
1. **Play to strengths** - Build on existing advantages
2. **Defensible position** - Sustainable differentiation
3. **Clear focus** - Can't win everywhere
4. **Realistic assessment** - Acknowledge gaps honestly
5. **Continuous evolution** - Strategy adapts as market changes

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Competitor obsession** - Building what competitors have vs what customers need
✅ Instead: Customer-led with competitive awareness

❌ **Static analysis** - One-time assessment that gets stale
✅ Instead: Regular updates and continuous monitoring

❌ **Feature parity trap** - Trying to match every competitor feature
✅ Instead: Differentiation through unique value

❌ **Underestimating newcomers** - Ignoring startups until too late
✅ Instead: Monitor emerging players and technologies

❌ **Overconfidence** - Dismissing competitor strengths
✅ Instead: Honest assessment of competitive advantages

❌ **Analysis paralysis** - Endless research without decisions
✅ Instead: Good enough analysis, then act and iterate
