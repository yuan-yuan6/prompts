# Quantum Computing Strategy & Implementation Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive framework for developing quantum computing strategies including technology assessment, use case identification, implementation roadmaps, talent development, and integration with classical computing systems.

## Quick Quantum Computing Prompt
Develop quantum strategy for [optimization/ML/simulation/cryptography]. Platform: [IBM Quantum/AWS Braket/Azure Quantum]. Timeline: [X months] pilot. Use cases: [specific problems with quantum advantage]. Team: [physicists/algorithm developers/software engineers]. Approach: cloud access → hybrid quantum-classical → vendor POCs. Investment: $[Y] with [Z%] ROI target. Skills: Qiskit/Cirq training, algorithm development.

## Quick Start

**Set Your Foundation:**
1. Define your organization name and quantum use case focus (optimization, ML, simulation)
2. Set target TVL and timeline (typically 18-36 months for pilot programs)
3. Identify your quantum platform preference (IBM Quantum, AWS Braket, Azure Quantum)

**Configure Key Parameters:**
4. Set investment budget and ROI targets aligned with business goals
5. Define device count needs and qubit requirements for target applications
6. Specify team composition (physicists, algorithm developers, software engineers)

**Implement & Deploy (Ongoing):**
7. Start with cloud access for experimentation phase (AWS Braket recommended for beginners)
8. Build hybrid quantum-classical workflows with existing infrastructure
9. Establish partnerships with hardware/software vendors for POC development
10. Track quantum advantage metrics and adjust strategy based on results

**Pro Tips:** Begin with quantum annealing for optimization problems, focus on NISQ-era algorithms, establish education programs early, and maintain realistic expectations about quantum advantage timelines.
