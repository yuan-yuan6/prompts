# Course Design Overview & Navigation Guide

## Purpose
This overview provides a quick introduction to comprehensive course design and guides you to specialized prompts for detailed work on each component.

## Course Design Process Overview

Effective course design is a systematic process that aligns learning objectives, content, teaching methods, and assessment. The process typically follows these steps:

### 1. **Establish Foundations** (Start Here)
Define your pedagogical approach, create measurable learning objectives, and establish the course mission.
→ **Use**: `course-foundations-objectives.md`

### 2. **Develop Content & Curriculum**
Organize course content, create curriculum maps, and design learning progressions.
→ **Use**: `course-content-curriculum.md`

### 3. **Design Assessment Strategy**
Create balanced assessment plans with formative and summative components, rubrics, and feedback systems.
→ **Use**: `course-assessment-strategy.md`

### 4. **Plan Technology Integration**
Select and implement educational technology, design online or hybrid delivery, and ensure digital accessibility.
→ **Use**: `course-technology-integration.md`

### 5. **Ensure Accessibility & Inclusion**
Apply Universal Design for Learning (UDL), create accommodations, and build culturally responsive practices.
→ **Use**: `course-accessibility-inclusion.md`

### 6. **Build Engagement Strategies**
Design activities that motivate students, promote active learning, and build learning communities.
→ **Use**: `course-student-engagement.md`

### 7. **Implement Quality Assurance**
Establish quality standards, collect feedback, and create continuous improvement processes.
→ **Use**: `course-quality-evaluation.md`

### 8. **Execute Implementation Plan**
Manage the course development project with timelines, resources, and stakeholder coordination.
→ **Use**: `course-implementation-plan.md`

## Quick Start Guide

### For New Course Development
Use this sequence:
1. **Foundations & Objectives** - Define what students will learn
2. **Implementation Plan** - Create project timeline
3. **Content & Curriculum** - Develop and organize content
4. **Assessment Strategy** - Design how you'll measure learning
5. **Technology Integration** - Set up digital tools
6. **Accessibility & Inclusion** - Ensure universal access
7. **Student Engagement** - Plan motivation strategies
8. **Quality Evaluation** - Establish feedback mechanisms

### For Course Redesign
Focus on problem areas:
- **Low student success?** → Assessment Strategy + Student Engagement
- **Accessibility issues?** → Accessibility & Inclusion + Technology Integration
- **Poor evaluations?** → Quality Evaluation + Student Engagement
- **Outdated content?** → Content & Curriculum + Foundations & Objectives
- **Moving online?** → Technology Integration + Accessibility & Inclusion

### For Course Refinement
Target specific improvements:
- **Better discussions?** → Student Engagement
- **Clearer objectives?** → Foundations & Objectives
- **Fairer grading?** → Assessment Strategy
- **More inclusive?** → Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Continuous improvement?** → Quality Evaluation

## Key Course Design Principles

### Backward Design
1. Start with learning objectives (what students should achieve)
2. Design assessments that measure those objectives
3. Create learning activities that prepare students for assessments
4. Select content that supports the learning activities

### Alignment
Ensure tight alignment between:
- **Objectives** ↔ **Content** ↔ **Activities** ↔ **Assessments**

Example:
- Objective: "Students will analyze case studies using ethical frameworks"
- Content: Ethical theories and frameworks
- Activity: Practice analyzing sample cases in groups
- Assessment: Individual case analysis with rubric

### Student-Centered Design
- Design for your actual students (not ideal students)
- Provide choice and flexibility where possible
- Support diverse learning needs
- Make relevance and purpose clear
- Build in opportunities for student voice

### Evidence-Based Practice
Ground design in:
- Learning science (how people learn)
- Pedagogical research (what teaching methods work)
- Assessment data (what helps students succeed)
- Student feedback (what supports or hinders learning)

## Common Course Design Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: "I have too much content to cover"
→ **Solution**: Prioritize essential concepts (course-content-curriculum.md), use flipped classroom to maximize in-class time (course-technology-integration.md)

**Challenge**: "Students aren't engaged or motivated"
→ **Solution**: Apply motivation frameworks, active learning strategies (course-student-engagement.md)

**Challenge**: "Grading is overwhelming and students complain it's unclear"
→ **Solution**: Design efficient assessment system with clear rubrics (course-assessment-strategy.md)

**Challenge**: "Some students can't access course materials"
→ **Solution**: Implement UDL and accessibility standards (course-accessibility-inclusion.md)

**Challenge**: "I don't know if students are actually learning what I'm teaching"
→ **Solution**: Align assessments with objectives, use formative assessment (course-assessment-strategy.md + course-quality-evaluation.md)

**Challenge**: "The course technology is confusing or unreliable"
→ **Solution**: Simplify tech stack, provide training, have backups (course-technology-integration.md)

## Essential Course Components Checklist

Before launching any course, ensure you have:

**Foundation**:
- [ ] Clear, measurable learning objectives
- [ ] Alignment between objectives, content, and assessment
- [ ] Pedagogical approach identified

**Content**:
- [ ] Complete curriculum map with weekly topics
- [ ] All required materials identified and accessible
- [ ] Learning activities designed for each module

**Assessment**:
- [ ] Balanced formative and summative assessments
- [ ] Clear rubrics for major assignments
- [ ] Feedback plan and timeline

**Delivery**:
- [ ] Technology set up and tested
- [ ] Accessible to all learners
- [ ] Student orientation materials ready

**Support**:
- [ ] Engagement strategies planned
- [ ] Communication plan established
- [ ] Quality evaluation mechanisms in place

## Using the Specialized Prompts

Each specialized prompt is designed to be:
- **Focused**: Covers ONE aspect of course design deeply
- **Actionable**: Provides specific strategies and templates
- **Efficient**: 150-250 lines, quick to use
- **Practical**: Includes examples and customization options

**How to Use**:
1. Identify which aspect of course design you need help with
2. Open the corresponding specialized prompt
3. Fill in the key variables for your course context
4. Use the AI-generated output as a foundation
5. Customize and refine based on your specific needs

**Tips**:
- You don't need to use all 8 prompts for every course
- Focus on your priority areas or problem areas
- Use multiple prompts iteratively (e.g., objectives → content → assessment)
- Combine outputs into your comprehensive course design

## Next Steps

**Starting a new course?**
→ Begin with `course-foundations-objectives.md` to establish your learning objectives and pedagogical approach.

**Redesigning an existing course?**
→ Start with `course-quality-evaluation.md` to analyze what needs improvement, then use relevant specialized prompts to address those areas.

**Need a complete course development plan?**
→ Use `course-implementation-plan.md` to create your project timeline and coordinate all components.

**Building an online or hybrid course?**
→ Start with `course-technology-integration.md` and `course-accessibility-inclusion.md` to ensure digital delivery is effective and accessible.
