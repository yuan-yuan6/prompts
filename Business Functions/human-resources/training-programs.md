# Training Programs Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to design and deliver training programs that build skills effectively with clear objectives, content systems, delivery operations, and measurable outcomes.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess training program readiness for [ORGANIZATION] targeting skills [SKILL_AREAS]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Needs analysis & objectives, (2) Curriculum design, (3) Content development & quality, (4) Delivery & facilitation, (5) Enablement & operations, (6) Measurement & improvement. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 90-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Needs Analysis & Objectives
- 1 — Initial: Training needs unclear; goals vague.
- 3 — Defined: Needs assessment and objectives defined; success criteria documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Needs are prioritized; objectives tie to performance outcomes.

### 2) Curriculum Design
- 1 — Initial: Curriculum ad-hoc; sequencing unclear.
- 3 — Defined: Curriculum mapped to objectives; prerequisites and paths defined.
- 5 — Optimized: Curriculum is modular and scalable; pathways support role progression.

### 3) Content Development & Quality
- 1 — Initial: Content inconsistent; quality varies widely.
- 3 — Defined: Content standards, templates, and review process.
- 5 — Optimized: Content is high-quality and reusable; updates are controlled and timely.

### 4) Delivery & Facilitation
- 1 — Initial: Delivery inconsistent; facilitation varies by trainer.
- 3 — Defined: Delivery modes and facilitation guides; trainer enablement.
- 5 — Optimized: Delivery is optimized by feedback; facilitation quality is consistently high.

### 5) Enablement & Operations
- 1 — Initial: Scheduling and logistics are manual; participation is low.
- 3 — Defined: Ops workflow; LMS usage; reminders and support.
- 5 — Optimized: Ops scale reliably; participation and completion improve.

### 6) Measurement & Improvement
- 1 — Initial: No measurement beyond attendance.
- 3 — Defined: Kirkpatrick-style measures; follow-up and impact tracking.
- 5 — Optimized: Measurement ties to performance; continuous improvement compounds results.

## Deliverables
- Training readiness scorecard and gap list
- Training objectives and curriculum map
- Content standards and asset library plan
- Delivery plan (modes, facilitation, scheduling)
- Measurement framework and improvement cadence

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [ORGANIZATION]: Organization name
- [SKILL_AREAS]: Skill areas
- [LEARNER_COUNT]: Learner count
- [DELIVERY_MODE]: Live/async/blended
- [LMS]: Learning management system
- [IMPACT_METRICS]: Impact metrics

## Example (Condensed)
- Organization: Building onboarding + manager training
- Scores (1–5): Objectives 3; Curriculum 2; Content 2; Delivery 3; Ops 2; Measurement 2
- 90-day priorities: Define curriculum paths; standardize content templates; implement measurement beyond completion
