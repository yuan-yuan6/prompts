## Best Practices

1. **Start with a clear problem statement** - Articulate the research problem before selecting theories
2. **Select theories that fit the problem** - Choose theoretical frameworks that genuinely illuminate your question
3. **Be explicit about paradigmatic assumptions** - Clearly state your epistemological and ontological positions
4. **Justify design choices** - Explain why your chosen design is most appropriate for your questions
5. **Ensure coherence** - Maintain alignment between paradigm, theory, questions, and design
6. **Consider practical constraints** - Balance methodological ideals with real-world feasibility
7. **Review literature thoroughly** - Ground your framework in comprehensive knowledge of the field
8. **Be innovative yet rigorous** - Balance methodological advancement with scientific soundness
9. **Document your reasoning** - Provide clear rationale for all major methodological decisions
10. **Seek expert feedback** - Have methodologists and content experts review your foundation

## Tips for Success

- Begin with extensive reading in your theoretical area before committing to frameworks
- Map out relationships between variables before finalizing your conceptual model
- Consider multiple paradigmatic approaches before selecting the most appropriate one
- Draft multiple versions of research questions to refine specificity and clarity
- Create visual diagrams of your theoretical framework to check for coherence
- Test the feasibility of your design through pilot work or expert consultation
- Ensure your theoretical framework has sufficient depth and novelty
- Balance comprehensiveness with focus - avoid trying to incorporate too many theories
- Consider cultural and contextual factors in theory selection and adaptation
- Document all major decisions and the reasoning behind them for future reference

## Customization Options

1. **Discipline-Specific Adaptation**: Tailor theoretical frameworks and design approaches to education, healthcare, psychology, sociology, or other fields with relevant theories and conventions

2. **Paradigmatic Emphasis**: Adjust depth of philosophical discussion based on discipline expectations - some fields require extensive paradigmatic justification while others focus more on practical design

3. **Theory Complexity Level**: Scale from single-theory frameworks for focused studies to complex multi-theory integration for interdisciplinary research

4. **Design Innovation Level**: Range from traditional well-established designs to cutting-edge methodological innovations depending on research goals and risk tolerance

5. **Cultural Contextualization**: Adapt theoretical frameworks and paradigmatic approaches for cross-cultural research, indigenous methodologies, or decolonizing research practices
