# FinTech Innovation Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess how ready your organization is to develop and operate fintech products (payments, lending, wealth, regtech, open banking) with the controls, compliance, and platform discipline needed to scale.

## Quick Assessment Prompt
Assess fintech innovation readiness for [SOLUTION_NAME] targeting [TARGET_MARKET] with [USER_BASE] users and [TRANSACTION_VOLUME] volume. Evaluate product and use-case definition, platform and integration design, security and fraud controls, regulatory and compliance readiness, operational execution (support, disputes, risk), and measurement and iteration cadence. Score each 1–5 and list the top gaps and next actions.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5 each)
Rate each dimension from 1 (ad hoc) to 5 (disciplined and repeatable). Total score is the sum across 6 dimensions (max 30).

1) Product Definition & Use-Case Fit
- 1: Use case is broad; target user and value proposition are unclear.
- 3: Use case is defined; MVP scope is set; assumptions are partially tested.
- 5: Clear value proposition, risk assumptions, and measurable success criteria.

2) Platform Architecture & Integration
- 1: Architecture is improvised; integrations are brittle.
- 3: Core components are defined; key integrations are planned.
- 5: Scalable architecture with clear boundaries, observability, and reliability targets.

3) Data, Risk Analytics & Decisioning
- 1: Risk signals are limited; monitoring is manual.
- 3: Basic analytics exist; monitoring is periodic.
- 5: Decisioning and monitoring are governed, tested, and continuously improved.

4) Security, Privacy & Fraud Controls
- 1: Controls are inconsistent; threat model is unclear.
- 3: Baseline controls exist; some testing and monitoring.
- 5: Strong auth, secure SDLC, and fraud controls with measurable performance.

5) Regulatory, Licensing & Compliance Readiness
- 1: Requirements are unknown; compliance is reactive.
- 3: Obligations mapped; vendor/compliance workflows exist.
- 5: Evidence-ready compliance program with owners, cadence, and change management.

6) Operations, Support & Partner Management
- 1: Disputes and incidents are handled ad hoc.
- 3: Basic runbooks exist; partner SLAs are defined.
- 5: Mature operations (support, disputes, reconciliation) with clear SLAs and metrics.

## Deliverables
- Product brief (target users, value proposition, KPIs, constraints)
- Architecture summary (components, integrations, data flows, reliability targets)
- Risk and fraud control set (signals, thresholds, monitoring, escalation)
- Compliance obligation map (licenses, policies, evidence, owners)
- Operating model (support, disputes, reconciliation, partners, SLAs)

## Maturity Scale
- Level 1: Reactive — unclear scope and inconsistent controls.
- Level 2: Documented — requirements captured; execution varies.
- Level 3: Repeatable — standard delivery and compliance workflows for core areas.
- Level 4: Managed — measurable reliability, security, and evidence discipline.
- Level 5: Optimizing — continuous improvement from incidents, outcomes, and learning.

## Variables
- [SOLUTION_NAME]
- [TARGET_MARKET]
- [USER_BASE]
- [TRANSACTION_VOLUME]
- [REVENUE_MODEL]
- [REGULATORY_REQUIREMENTS]
- [SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS]
- [PARTNER_INTEGRATIONS]

## Example (Condensed)
Digital wallet launching in two states.
- Product: defined MVP (P2P + card funding) with success KPIs.
- Compliance: mapped obligations (KYC/AML, disputes) with evidence cadence.
- Ops: reconciliation and support runbooks tied to SLAs and monitoring.
