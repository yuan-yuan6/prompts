### 2. Align with Learning Outcomes
**Backward Design Approach**:
1. Identify desired results (learning outcomes)
2. Determine acceptable evidence (assessment)
3. Plan learning experiences (instruction)

**Alignment Checklist**:
- [ ] Each outcome has corresponding assessment
- [ ] Assessment matches cognitive level of outcome
- [ ] Assessment allows students to demonstrate mastery
- [ ] Assessment is authentic and meaningful
- [ ] Time and resources are adequate

### 3. Select Assessment Methods
**Match Method to Purpose**:
