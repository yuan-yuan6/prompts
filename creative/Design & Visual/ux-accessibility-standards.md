## Best Practices

1. **Design with accessibility from the start** - Don't retrofit, build it in
2. **Follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum** - Industry standard for compliance
3. **Test with real assistive technology** - Don't rely on automated tools alone
4. **Include disabled users in testing** - Direct feedback is invaluable
5. **Provide multiple ways to interact** - Keyboard, mouse, touch, voice
6. **Use semantic HTML** - Proper markup is foundation of accessibility
7. **Ensure sufficient color contrast** - 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components
8. **Make all functionality keyboard accessible** - No mouse-only interactions
9. **Provide clear focus indicators** - Users need to know where they are
10. **Write clear, descriptive labels** - Help all users understand your interface

## Tips for Success

- Use accessibility linters and tools in your development workflow
- Create accessible component defaults in your design system
- Build accessibility review into your QA process
- Partner with disability advocacy organizations for testing
- Document accessibility decisions and patterns
