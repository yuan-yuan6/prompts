# Press Release & Media Relations Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to **generate earned media coverage, manage journalist relationships, and control narrative** through effective press releases, media outreach, and spokesperson performance. Use this to diagnose gaps in news judgment, media targeting, and message discipline.

## 🚀 Quick Assessment Prompt

> Assess **press release & media relations readiness** for {MEDIA_CONTEXT}. The media objectives are {OBJECTIVES}. Account for {CONSTRAINTS}. Score 1–5 across the six dimensions below and produce the required output (six deliverables).

---

## Template

Conduct a press release & media relations readiness assessment for {MEDIA_CONTEXT}.

Score each dimension **1–5** (1 = ad hoc, 5 = optimized). Ground findings in observable signals (media coverage volume/tone, journalist relationships, message consistency, spokesperson performance).

**1) NEWS JUDGMENT & STORY DEVELOPMENT**
- Newsworthy stories are identified proactively (not just announcements)
- Angles are tailored to journalist beats and audience interests
- Timing is strategic (industry events, news cycles, exclusives)
- Non-newsworthy items are handled through owned channels (not press releases)

**2) PRESS RELEASE QUALITY & AP STYLE**
- Headlines are compelling and concise (8–10 words, active voice)
- Lead paragraphs answer who/what/when/where/why in 1–2 sentences
- Quotes add color and humanity (not bland corporate speak)
- Boilerplate is current, concise, and relevant

**3) MEDIA TARGETING & JOURNALIST RELATIONSHIPS**
- Media lists are segmented by beat, outlet type, and audience
- Journalists are researched (recent articles, interests, preferences)
- Relationships are cultivated consistently (not just during pitches)
- Pitches are personalized and concise (why this matters to their audience)

**4) SPOKESPERSON READINESS & MESSAGE DISCIPLINE**
- Spokespeople are trained and media-ready (message delivery, bridging, tough questions)
- Key messages are clear, consistent, and memorable
- Answers stay on-message while feeling authentic (not robotic)
- Crisis scenarios are practiced and prepared

**5) DISTRIBUTION & FOLLOW-UP EXECUTION**
- Distribution timing and channels are optimized (embargo strategy, wire services)
- Pitches are sent strategically (exclusives to tier-1, then broader)
- Follow-up is persistent but respectful (no spam, add value)
- Multimedia assets are professional and accessible (photos, videos, data)

**6) MEASUREMENT & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**
- Media coverage is tracked (volume, tone, key messages, reach, share-of-voice)
- Journalist response rates and conversion are measured
- Post-mortems identify what worked and what to improve
- Media strategy evolves based on performance data

## Maturity Scale (Use for Overall + Per-Dimension Scoring)
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (poor news judgment, weak relationships, inconsistent messages)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (basic releases, some coverage, ad hoc relationships)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid quality, growing relationships, consistent coverage)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (high coverage, strong relationships, message discipline)
- 5.0: Optimized (media darling, trusted source, industry voice)

---

## Variables (≤3)
- {MEDIA_CONTEXT}: Org type, industry, current media visibility, reputation status
- {OBJECTIVES}: Coverage volume/tone, journalist relationships, message penetration goals
- {CONSTRAINTS}: PR team size, spokesperson availability, controversial topics, competitive noise

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- {MEDIA_CONTEXT}: Series B SaaS startup (150 employees, cybersecurity industry). Current media presence: 8 mentions/year (mostly funding announcements, product launches). No dedicated PR (marketing manager handles). Competitors get 30–50 mentions/year. Spokesperson: CEO (no media training, inconsistent messages). Media list: 20 cybersecurity journalists (no recent contact, cold pitches only).
- {OBJECTIVES}: Increase coverage to 25 mentions/year, build relationships with 10 tier-1 journalists, establish CEO as thought leader, improve message consistency (top 3 messages in 70% of coverage).
- {CONSTRAINTS}: No PR budget (goal <$50K/year for tools/training); CEO has limited availability (4 hrs/month for media); competitive industry (50+ vendors); technical product (hard to explain simply).

**1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
- Overall maturity: 2.4 (Developing)
- Key risks: 8 mentions/year = invisible; no journalist relationships = hard to break through; inconsistent messages confuse market
- Top improvements: (1) train CEO on media skills and key messages, (2) build relationships with 10 tier-1 journalists, (3) develop newsjacking and thought leadership strategy

**2) DIMENSION SCORECARD**
- News Judgment & Story Development: 2/5 — only announce products/funding; no angles, newsjacking, or thought leadership
- Press Release Quality & AP Style: 3/5 — decent structure but jargon-heavy; quotes bland; headlines weak
- Media Targeting & Relationships: 2/5 — cold pitches only; no personalization; journalists don't respond
- Spokesperson Readiness & Message Discipline: 2/5 — CEO not trained; messages inconsistent; talks product features not benefits
- Distribution & Follow-Up: 2/5 — uses free wire service (low reach); no follow-up; no multimedia assets
- Measurement & Improvement: 2/5 — tracks mentions but not tone/messages; no post-mortems

**3) MEDIA COVERAGE ANALYSIS**
- Volume: 8 mentions/year (goal 25, competitor avg 40)
  - Breakdown: 4 funding/M&A, 3 product launches, 1 industry roundup
  - Zero thought leadership, commentary, or earned features
- Tone: 75% neutral (factual announcements), 25% positive (product reviews), 0% negative
- Key message penetration: top 3 messages appear in 40% of coverage (goal 70%)
  - Desired messages: "zero-trust security," "AI-powered threat detection," "enterprise-ready"
  - Actual coverage: focuses on features/pricing, not strategic positioning
- Share-of-voice: 3% of cybersecurity coverage (competitors: 10–15% leaders, 5–8% mid-tier)
- Top outlets: TechCrunch (2 mentions), VentureBeat (2), Dark Reading (1), SC Magazine (1), ZDNet (1), CSO Online (1)
- Top journalists: 6 different reporters (no repeat coverage = no relationships)
- Coverage themes: product announcements (60%), funding (40%), zero strategic positioning

**4) PRESS RELEASE & PITCH AUDIT**
- Recent releases (past 12 months, 6 total):
  - Series B announcement: well-written, good angle (market validation), strong coverage (3 outlets)
  - Product launch (3 releases): jargon-heavy, no differentiation vs. competitors, minimal coverage (1 outlet each)
  - Customer win (1 release): non-newsworthy (small customer, no exclusivity), zero coverage
  - Partnership announcement (1 release): buried lead (partner more interesting than our angle), 1 outlet
- Quality assessment:
  - Headlines: 5/10 avg (too long, passive voice, jargon: "Company X Announces Enhanced Cybersecurity Platform")
  - Lead paragraphs: 6/10 avg (answer W5 but boring, feature-focused not benefit-focused)
  - Quotes: 4/10 avg (CEO quotes sound like marketing copy: "We're excited to announce...")
  - Boilerplate: 7/10 (accurate but dry, needs personality)
- Pitch audit (20 pitches sent, 3 responses = 15% response rate; goal 30%):
  - Generic subject lines: "Press Release: [Company] Launches [Product]"
  - No personalization (mass BCC to entire media list)
  - No context for why journalist should care (no reference to their beat/recent articles)
  - Follow-up: zero (send and pray)
- Multimedia assets: product screenshots only (low resolution, no video, no infographics)

**5) SPOKESPERSON & MESSAGE ASSESSMENT**
- Spokesperson: CEO (only trained spokesperson)
  - Training: none (no media training, no interview practice)
  - Performance (from interview recordings): 5/10 avg
    - Strengths: authentic, passionate, technical credibility
    - Weaknesses: rambles (answers too long), uses jargon, doesn't bridge to key messages, defensive on tough questions
  - Availability: 4 hrs/month (limits media opportunities)
- Backup spokespeople: none (CTO technical but not trained; VP Marketing not positioned)
- Message consistency:
  - Key messages (intended): "zero-trust security," "AI-powered threat detection," "enterprise-ready"
  - Actual messages (from coverage): inconsistent—sometimes talks tech stack, sometimes market fit, sometimes customer stories
  - Message penetration: 40% of coverage includes at least 1 key message (goal 70%)
- Training gaps: message discipline, bridging techniques, handling tough questions (competitive, security breaches), concise answers

**6) 30/60/90-DAY MEDIA RELATIONS PLAN**
- 30 days: media train CEO (half-day session: key messages, bridging, tough Q&A); refine top 3 messages and supporting proof points; audit all media materials (releases, boilerplate, pitches) for clarity and consistency; research 10 tier-1 journalists (read 10 recent articles each, identify interests/beats)
- 60 days: launch relationship-building campaign (send personalized intros to 10 journalists with no ask, just value: relevant research, customer data, expert commentary offers); develop newsjacking strategy (identify 5 industry events/trends to comment on); create multimedia asset library (CEO headshot, product demo video, infographics on threat landscape)
- 90 days: pitch 3 thought leadership stories (exclusive interviews, contributed articles, expert commentary); measure response rates (goal 25%), coverage (goal 15 mentions), message penetration (goal 55%); train VP Marketing as backup spokesperson; conduct post-mortems on all pitches (what worked, what flopped)
- Metrics: coverage mentions (goal 15 by 90 days, ~6/quarter pace to 25/year), response rate (goal 25%), message penetration (goal 55%), journalist relationships (goal 5 responsive contacts)

## Best Practices (Exactly 8)
1) Be newsworthy or don't pitch: save "meh" announcements for owned channels—journalists hate spam.
2) Lead with the angle, not the announcement: "Cybersecurity breaches up 40%—here's why" beats "Company X Launches Product Y."
3) Personalize every pitch: reference journalist's recent work and explain why your story fits their beat.
4) Train spokespeople relentlessly: media skills aren't innate—practice message discipline, bridging, and tough Q&A.
5) Build relationships before you pitch: offer value (data, expert commentary, introductions) with no ask first.
6) Follow up strategically: one reminder 24–48 hours after pitch, then move on—persistence ≠ pestering.
7) Track message penetration, not just mentions: coverage without key messages is wasted opportunity.
8) Do post-mortems on every pitch: learn from successes and failures to improve news judgment and targeting.
