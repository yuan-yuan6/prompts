# Academic Publication Writing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Comprehensively assess readiness to draft, submit, and revise an academic publication across six dimensions: Contribution & Positioning, Evidence & Method Reporting, Argument Structure & Clarity, Compliance & Research Integrity, Presentation & Supporting Materials, and Submission & Revision Workflow. This framework helps you identify blockers, reduce desk-reject risk, and produce a realistic writing and submission plan.

## Template

Conduct a comprehensive academic publication writing readiness assessment for {MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT} targeting {TARGET_VENUE} as a {PUBLICATION_TYPE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. CONTRIBUTION & POSITIONING READINESS**
Evaluate whether the manuscript’s core contribution is explicit by assessing whether the research question and motivation are crisp, the gap in prior work is convincingly established, and the paper’s novelty is stated as specific, defensible claims that match the venue’s aims and readership. Examine whether related work is selective but sufficient, whether the framing differentiates your contribution from adjacent approaches, and whether limitations and scope boundaries are stated in a way that strengthens credibility rather than weakening impact.

**2. EVIDENCE & METHOD REPORTING READINESS**
Evaluate whether the manuscript can survive methodological scrutiny by assessing whether design choices are justified, measures and instruments are described precisely, sampling and recruitment are transparent, and analysis steps can be reproduced or reasonably audited. Examine whether assumptions, robustness checks, error sources, and sensitivity analyses are addressed at the depth expected in the target venue, and whether results are reported with appropriate uncertainty, effect sizes, and interpretive restraint.

**3. ARGUMENT STRUCTURE & CLARITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the paper tells a coherent story by assessing whether the structure fits the publication type, each section does one job well, and claims are consistently linked to evidence without overreach. Examine whether the abstract and introduction set up the paper’s promise and deliver on it, whether tables and figures are referenced with clear takeaways, and whether the discussion distinguishes findings, interpretation, implications, and speculation in a way that readers and reviewers can follow.

**4. COMPLIANCE & RESEARCH INTEGRITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether the manuscript meets ethical and integrity expectations by assessing whether approvals (IRB/ethics), consent language, data privacy considerations, conflicts of interest, funding statements, authorship roles, and citation practices are complete and consistent. Examine whether plagiarism risk is mitigated, whether reuse of text/figures is appropriately attributed, whether reporting standards relevant to your design are followed, and whether data/code availability statements match what you can actually provide.

**5. PRESENTATION & SUPPORTING MATERIALS READINESS**
Evaluate whether presentation quality supports acceptance by assessing whether figures and tables are readable, labeled, and truthful to the analysis, and whether the manuscript’s formatting aligns with venue requirements. Examine whether supplementary materials exist where expected (protocols, appendices, extra analyses, codebooks), whether references are clean and consistent in the required style, and whether the paper includes the right reporting checklist or structured elements (for example, PRISMA-style sections for reviews or CONSORT-like elements where applicable).

**6. SUBMISSION & REVISION WORKFLOW READINESS**
Evaluate whether the project can be executed efficiently by assessing whether coauthor responsibilities are defined, decision rights are clear for disputed edits, and deadlines and checkpoints are realistic for the team’s availability. Examine whether there is an explicit plan for pre-submission review, internal quality checks, submission logistics, and a response-to-review workflow that can produce high-quality revisions quickly, including a strategy for handling major methodological requests, additional experiments, or reframing.

## Required Output Format

Structure your assessment as:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, submission recommendation (submit / revise-first), top 3 risks, estimated time-to-submit (weeks)

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table with score (X.X/5) and the single most important fix per dimension

3. **DESK-REJECT RISK CHECK** - 5–7 common rejection drivers for the target venue and whether each is “covered / partial / missing”

4. **PRIORITIZED FIX LIST** - Top 8 actions ranked by impact and effort, including “definition of done” for each

5. **WRITING & REVISION PLAN** - A time-boxed plan (e.g., 2–8 weeks) with section-level milestones and review checkpoints

6. **SUBMISSION CHECKLIST** - Venue requirements, compliance items, and final QA steps before clicking submit

Use this maturity scale:
- **1.0–1.9: Unprepared** (fragmented draft, unclear claims, major compliance or methods gaps)
- **2.0–2.9: Developing** (draft exists, but reviewers will find substantive gaps)
- **3.0–3.9: Ready with revisions** (solid paper; targeted improvements needed before submission)
- **4.0–4.9: Submission-ready** (polished, compliant, and well-positioned)
- **5.0: Exemplary** (field-leading clarity, rigor, and presentation; strong fit and impact)

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT}` | What you’re writing and what study/material it’s based on | "Mixed-methods study on remote onboarding for nurses in community hospitals" |
| `{TARGET_VENUE}` | The specific journal, conference, or publisher (or a precise category if undecided) | "Journal of Medical Internet Research" or "CHI Late-Breaking Work" |
| `{PUBLICATION_TYPE}` | The deliverable format | "journal article (IMRAD)" or "conference paper" or "registered report" |

## Usage Example

**Input:**
"{MANUSCRIPT_CONTEXT}: Quantitative evaluation of a new tutoring intervention in first-year calculus (n=312)"
"{TARGET_VENUE}: An education research journal with methods-focused reviewers"
"{PUBLICATION_TYPE}: Journal article (IMRAD)"

**Output (abridged):**
- Overall Readiness: **2.8/5.0 (Developing)**
- Recommendation: **REVISE-FIRST** (submit in ~5–7 weeks)
- Top Risks: unclear contribution vs prior interventions, incomplete reporting of attrition/handling missing data, figures not aligned to claims

Dimension Scorecard:
- Contribution & Positioning: 2.7/5 (tighten novelty statement; add 6–8 anchor citations that define the baseline)
- Evidence & Method Reporting: 2.5/5 (add CONSORT-style flow details, missing-data strategy, and robustness checks)
- Argument Structure & Clarity: 3.0/5 (abstract and discussion need better claim discipline)
- Compliance & Integrity: 3.5/5 (add data availability and COI/funding statements; verify citation consistency)
- Presentation & Materials: 2.6/5 (revise Figure 2–3 for readability; add appendix for instruments)
- Submission & Workflow: 3.2/5 (define coauthor review schedule; set a final QA checklist)

Prioritized Fix List (top 4):
1) Rewrite contribution paragraph + abstract “claim map” so every claim has evidence. 2) Add missing-data plan, attrition reporting, and robustness checks. 3) Redesign key figures for one-take readability and correct labeling. 4) Add limitations that bound generalizability without undermining the main result.

Writing & Revision Plan:
- Week 1: Contribution rewrite + related work anchors; methods completeness pass.
- Week 2: Robustness checks + updated results; regenerate figures.
- Week 3: Discussion rewrite + limitations; compliance items.
- Week 4–5: Internal review cycle + final formatting + submission.
