# Course Assessment Strategy Designer

## Purpose
Design a comprehensive, balanced assessment strategy that measures learning objectives through diverse methods, provides meaningful feedback, and promotes student growth.

## Quick Start

**For educators who need**: A complete assessment strategy aligned with learning objectives

**Essential inputs**:
- Course title and duration
- 3-5 key learning objectives
- Student level
- Any required assessments (departmental exam, etc.)

**5-minute starter**:
1. For each learning objective, identify HOW you'll know if students achieved it
2. List types of assessments you're considering (quizzes, papers, projects, exams)
3. Decide rough grade distribution (e.g., 30% formative, 40% projects, 30% exams)
4. Note when major assessments will occur (spread throughout or end-loaded?)
5. Identify where students will get feedback to improve before high-stakes assessment

**Common first use**: "Design assessment strategy for 'Introduction to Biology' - 200 students, 15 weeks. Objectives: understand cellular processes, apply scientific method, analyze data, evaluate research. Need automated quizzes for efficiency, but want some authentic assessment. Required: comprehensive final exam (30%). LMS with auto-grading available."

**Expected output**: Complete assessment plan with formative and summative strategies, grading breakdown with justification, assessment calendar, detailed rubrics for major assignments, feedback systems, validity and reliability considerations, and options for revision and growth.

**Best for**: New course design, assessment redesign, improving alignment between objectives and evaluation, creating rubrics, balancing formative and summative assessment, planning feedback systems.

## 2. ASSESSMENT PLAN & GRADING BREAKDOWN

Create a complete assessment schedule:

### Assessment Calendar

| Week | Assessment | Type | Points/Weight | Learning Objectives Assessed |
|------|------------|------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1    | [Assessment name] | Diagnostic | N/A or XX% | [Objectives] |
| 2-3  | [Assessment name] | Formative  | XX% | [Objectives] |
| ...  | ...        | ...   | ... | ... |

### Grading Distribution
Recommend point/percentage allocation:
- Formative Assessments (ongoing): XX%
  - Weekly quizzes/checks: X%
  - Discussion participation: X%
  - Practice assignments: X%
- Major Assignments/Projects: XX%
  - Assignment 1: X%
  - Assignment 2: X%
  - Final Project: X%
- Exams/Tests: XX%
  - Midterm: X%
  - Final: X%
- Self-Assessment/Reflection: XX%
- Participation/Engagement: XX%

**Total: 100%**

Justify the distribution based on:
- Alignment with learning objectives
- Balance between formative and summative
- Opportunities for revision and growth
- Cognitive load and student workload

## 3. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT DESIGN

### Ongoing Progress Monitoring
Design low-stakes, frequent assessments:

**Weekly Check-ins**:
- Quick quizzes (5-10 questions) on key concepts
- One-minute papers or exit tickets
- Discussion board reflections
- Self-assessment checklists
- Concept mapping exercises

**Interactive Assessments**:
- Think-pair-share activities
- Peer teaching exercises
- Case study analysis discussions
- Problem-solving in groups
- Live polling during class

**Practice Assignments**:
- Problem sets with immediate feedback
- Draft submissions with revision opportunity
- Peer review exercises
- Reflective journal entries
- Practice presentations or demonstrations

### Feedback Mechanisms
For each formative assessment, specify:
- **Turnaround Time**: How quickly students receive feedback
- **Feedback Type**: Automated, peer, instructor comments, rubric-based
- **Actionable Guidance**: How feedback helps students improve
- **Revision Opportunities**: Can students apply feedback and resubmit?

## 4. SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT DESIGN

### Major Assessment Instruments
Design 2-4 significant assessments:

**Assessment 1: [Type and Title]**
- **Learning Objectives Measured**: [Specific objectives]
- **Format**: [Paper, project, exam, presentation, portfolio, etc.]
- **Description**: [What students must do]
- **Authenticity**: [How it connects to real-world application]
- **Time Allocation**: [In-class time and/or out-of-class hours]
- **Submission Format**: [How students submit]
- **Weight**: [Percentage of final grade]

**Assessment 2: [Type and Title]**
[Repeat structure above]

**Final/Capstone Assessment**:
- **Comprehensive or Modular**: Cover entire course or final unit?
- **Format**: [Exam, project, presentation, portfolio]
- **Integration Requirement**: How students synthesize learning
- **Alignment Check**: Covers all major learning objectives

### Authentic Assessment Integration
Where possible, include real-world tasks:
- Industry-relevant projects
- Problem-solving for actual clients or community partners
- Portfolio development for professional use
- Presentations to authentic audiences
- Research with practical applications
- Creative products with real purposes

## 5. RUBRIC DEVELOPMENT

### Performance Criteria
For each major assessment, create a rubric:

**[Assessment Name] Rubric**

| Criteria | Exemplary (A) | Proficient (B) | Developing (C) | Beginning (D/F) | Weight |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| [Criterion 1] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | XX% |
| [Criterion 2] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | [Detailed descriptor] | XX% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Rubric Design Principles**:
- Use clear, specific behavioral descriptors (not vague terms)
- Align each criterion directly with learning objectives
- Make quality differences between levels obvious
- Include both content mastery and skill demonstration
- Weight criteria based on importance
- Provide rubric to students before assignment

### Self-Assessment Integration
Include student self-evaluation:
- Students use rubric to assess their own work before submission
- Reflective component where students justify their self-assessment
- Comparison between self-assessment and instructor assessment
- Growth tracking across multiple assessments

## 6. ASSESSMENT VALIDITY & RELIABILITY

### Alignment Verification
Ensure each assessment:
- **Content Validity**: Directly measures stated learning objectives
- **Appropriate Cognitive Level**: Matches Bloom's taxonomy level of objective
- **Adequate Coverage**: Important content weighted appropriately
- **Clear Instructions**: Students understand what's expected
- **Appropriate Difficulty**: Challenging but achievable for target students

### Reliability Considerations
Build in quality controls:
- **Clear Rubrics**: Reduce subjectivity in grading
- **Sample Answers**: Develop answer keys or exemplars for reference
- **Consistent Application**: Apply same standards to all students
- **Bias Check**: Review for cultural bias or accessibility barriers
- **Pilot Testing**: Test new assessments with small group first (if possible)

## 7. GRADING & FEEDBACK SYSTEMS

### Grading Philosophy Statement
Articulate your approach:
- How grades reflect learning (mastery vs. effort vs. improvement)
- Late work policy and rationale
- Revision and resubmission policy
- Extra credit policy (if any)
- Participation grading criteria
- Academic integrity expectations

### Feedback Quality Standards
Commit to providing:
- **Timely Feedback**: Within [X] days of submission
- **Specific Comments**: Not just "good job" but what specifically was good
- **Actionable Guidance**: Concrete suggestions for improvement
- **Balanced Approach**: Recognize strengths and identify growth areas
- **Forward-Looking**: Connect to future assignments and learning

### Growth-Oriented Practices
Consider including:
- Opportunity to revise major assignments after feedback
- Lowest formative assessment score dropped
- Mastery-based reassessment for key competencies
- Portfolio approach where students select best work
- Reflection on growth throughout course

## 8. ASSESSMENT QUALITY CHECKLIST

Verify that your assessment strategy:
- Measures all stated learning objectives
- Includes multiple assessment methods (not just exams)
- Balances formative and summative assessment
- Provides frequent, actionable feedback
- Offers authentic, real-world applications
- Accommodates diverse learners and learning styles
