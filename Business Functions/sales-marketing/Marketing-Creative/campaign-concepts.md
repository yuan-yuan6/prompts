# Campaign Concepts Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess readiness to create campaign concepts that are strategically aligned, insight-driven, executable across channels, and measurable.

## Quick Prompt

> Assess campaign concept readiness for [BRAND_NAME] running a [CAMPAIGN_TYPE] for [TARGET_MARKET] over [CAMPAIGN_DURATION]. Score readiness (1–5) across: (1) Objective & strategy fit, (2) Audience insight & tension, (3) Big idea & message architecture, (4) Channel activation & content plan, (5) Creative production & partnering, (6) Measurement & optimization. Provide a scorecard, top gaps, and a 60-day plan.

## Readiness Scorecard (1–5)

### 1) Objective & Strategy Fit
- 1 — Initial: Objectives are vague; concept is disconnected from business outcomes.
- 3 — Defined: Clear objectives, audience, and offer; concept ties to positioning and outcomes.
- 5 — Optimized: Strategy, budget, and creative are aligned; tradeoffs are explicit; decisions are fast.

### 2) Audience Insight & Tension
- 1 — Initial: Audience is broad; no clear tension/need; ideas are based on internal taste.
- 3 — Defined: Motivations, objections, and cultural context documented; insights inform the idea.
- 5 — Optimized: Insight pipeline exists; segments are operationalized; ideas are tested early.

### 3) Big Idea & Message Architecture
- 1 — Initial: Theme is generic; messaging changes by channel; no repeatable structure.
- 3 — Defined: Big idea is clear; message pillars, proof points, and CTAs are consistent.
- 5 — Optimized: Message architecture scales across formats; personalization rules are clear; brand coherence holds.

### 4) Channel Activation & Content Plan
- 1 — Initial: Channel selection is arbitrary; content plan is missing or unrealistic.
- 3 — Defined: Channel mix maps to audience behavior; content plan and cadence are feasible.
- 5 — Optimized: Activation is orchestrated across funnel; dependencies are managed; reuse reduces effort.

### 5) Creative Production & Partnering
- 1 — Initial: Unclear roles; briefs vary; rework is high; timelines slip.
- 3 — Defined: Standard brief; clear owners; review/approval workflow; asset specs are known.
- 5 — Optimized: Predictable throughput; modular asset system; partners and internal teams collaborate smoothly.

### 6) Measurement & Optimization
- 1 — Initial: KPIs unclear; tracking is inconsistent; optimization is reactive.
- 3 — Defined: KPI framework; measurement plan; testing cadence; learnings documented.
- 5 — Optimized: Experimentation program; creative analytics; attribution assumptions explicit; insights drive iteration.

## Deliverables
- Readiness scorecard with top gaps and recommendations
- Campaign concept brief (objective, audience, offer, big idea, message pillars)
- Channel activation plan (funnel mapping, cadence, asset list)
- Creative production plan (owners, timeline, approvals)
- Measurement and testing plan (KPIs, hypotheses, cadence)

## Maturity Scale
- 1.0–1.9: Initial (ad-hoc, minimal capabilities)
- 2.0–2.9: Developing (some capabilities, significant gaps)
- 3.0–3.9: Defined (solid foundation, scaling challenges)
- 4.0–4.9: Managed (mature capabilities, optimization focus)
- 5.0: Optimized (industry-leading, continuous improvement)

## Variables
- [BRAND_NAME]: Brand name
- [CAMPAIGN_TYPE]: Product launch, awareness, seasonal, rebrand, event
- [TARGET_MARKET]: Primary audience/segment
- [CAMPAIGN_DURATION]: Duration and milestones
- [CHANNELS]: Channel list and key placements
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: KPIs (reach, engagement, leads, revenue, ROAS)

## Example (Condensed)
- Brand: Consumer fintech app
- Campaign: Awareness + acquisition in 8 weeks across paid social + search
- Scores (1–5): Strategy 3; Insight 2; Big Idea 3; Activation 2; Production 3; Measurement 2
- Top gaps: Weak audience tension definition; unclear channel sequencing; limited experimentation discipline
- 60-day priorities: Clarify tension/objections; define sequencing and asset inventory; implement weekly optimization cadence
