Generate comprehensive scene writing guidance that includes:

## 1. CINEMATIC LANGUAGE AND SHOT TYPES

### 1.1 Basic Shot Composition
#### Shot Sizes and Framing
##### Wide and Establishing Shots
- Extreme Wide Shot (EWS): Context and scale, entire environment visible
- Wide Shot (WS): Full subject in environment, establishing location
- Medium Wide Shot: Subject prominent but environment still important
- Use for: Scene establishment, location transition, spatial relationships

##### Medium Shots
- Medium Shot (MS): Waist up, conversational distance
- Medium Close-Up (MCU): Chest up, intimate but not extreme
- Use for: Dialogue, subject focus with some environment
- Balance of subject and context

##### Close-Ups
- Close-Up (CU): Head and shoulders, emotional detail visible
- Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Eyes, hands, objects, intense detail
- Insert Shot: Specific object or detail, informational
- Use for: Emotion, detail, emphasis, transition

##### Specialized Shots
- Over-the-Shoulder (OTS): Conversation and interaction
- Point-of-View (POV): Subjective camera, audience as character
- Dutch Angle: Tilted horizon, disorientation or tension
- Aerial/Drone Shot: Top-down or elevated perspective

### 1.2 Camera Movement Techniques
#### Static Camera Movements
- Tripod/Static: Stability, formal, controlled composition
- Fixed Frame: Subjects move within static frame
- Locked-Off Shot: Precision for VFX or time-lapse
- Use for: Formal presentations, interviews, product shots

#### Dynamic Camera Movements
##### Pan and Tilt
- Pan: Horizontal rotation, follow action or reveal
- Tilt: Vertical rotation, reveal height or depth
- Whip Pan: Fast pan for transition or energy
- Speed and smoothness variations for mood

##### Dolly and Track
- Dolly In: Move toward subject, intensify or reveal
- Dolly Out: Move away from subject, reveal context or isolate
- Tracking Shot: Follow subject in motion, dynamic energy
- Arc/Curved Dolly: Circular movement around subject

##### Crane and Jib
- Crane Up: Vertical rise, opening up or conclusion
- Crane Down: Vertical descent, closing in or intimacy
- Combination Moves: Crane + pan/tilt for complex reveals

##### Handheld and Steadicam
- Handheld: Raw, intimate, documentary feel, controlled shake
- Steadicam: Smooth following, fluid through spaces
- Gimbal/Stabilizer: Floating camera, dreamlike quality
- Walk-and-Talk: Follow conversation in motion

### 1.3 Advanced Composition Principles
#### Rule of Thirds and Balance
- Subject placement on intersection points
- Horizon line on upper or lower third
- Leading room (space in direction of gaze/motion)
- Headroom (space above subject's head)
- Asymmetrical balance for visual interest

#### Depth and Layering
- Foreground, Middle Ground, Background separation
- Depth of field control (shallow vs deep focus)
- Leading lines to guide eye through frame
- Frame within frame for depth and focus
- Overlapping elements for dimensionality

## 2. VISUAL METAPHOR AND SYMBOLISM

### 2.1 Color Psychology in Scenes
#### Emotional Color Associations
- Red: Passion, danger, urgency, love, anger
- Blue: Trust, calm, professionalism, sadness, cold
- Green: Nature, growth, wealth, envy, health
- Yellow: Happiness, energy, caution, optimism
- Purple: Luxury, creativity, mystery, spirituality
- Orange: Energy, enthusiasm, warmth, adventure
- Black/Dark: Sophistication, power, mystery, fear
- White/Light: Purity, simplicity, cleanliness, emptiness

#### Color in Scene Design
- Color grading and mood setting
- Color contrast for emphasis
- Color temperature (warm vs cool scenes)
- Color consistency within sequences
- Color transitions for narrative shifts
- Cultural color meanings consideration

### 2.2 Symbolic Visual Elements
#### Objects and Props
- Metaphorical object selection
- Repeated visual motifs
- Symbolic positioning in frame
- Object transformation through narrative
- Cultural and universal symbols
- Personal vs archetypal symbols

#### Lighting as Symbol
- Light = truth, revelation, hope, clarity
- Shadow = mystery, danger, unknown, hidden
- Contrast = conflict, duality, drama
- Soft light = gentleness, romance, peace
- Hard light = tension, drama, clarity
- Changing light = passage of time, transformation

## 3. SCENE WRITING FORMAT

### 3.1 Professional Script Format
#### Scene Heading (Slug Line)
```
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
```
- INT (interior) or EXT (exterior)
- Location name in CAPS
- Time of day (DAY, NIGHT, MORNING, DUSK, etc.)

#### Action Lines
```
SARAH (28, confident marketing executive) strides into the bustling coffee shop.
She scans the room, her eyes landing on JAMES, who sits alone at a corner table,
nervously checking his phone.

The BARISTA calls out orders over the hiss of the espresso machine.
```
- Present tense, active voice
- Character names in CAPS on first mention
- Important sounds in CAPS
- Concise, visual, active descriptions
- What the camera sees, not internal thoughts

#### Camera Direction (use sparingly)
```
CLOSE ON Sarah's phone screen - a text from James: "We need to talk."

PULL BACK TO REVEAL her worried expression.
```
- Only when essential to story
- Smooth reading flow maintained
- Director may ignore, but suggests vision

### 3.2 Visual Description Techniques
#### Show, Don't Tell
**Weak**: "John is nervous."
**Strong**: "John's fingers drum the table. He checks his watch for the third time in a minute."

**Weak**: "The room is messy."
**Strong**: "Clothes spill from an overturned laundry basket. Pizza boxes stack three-high on the coffee table. Sunlight struggles through dust-coated blinds."

#### Sensory Detail Integration
- Visual: What we see (80% of description)
- Audio: What we hear (ambient sound, dialogue, music)
- Movement: Action and motion within frame
- Texture: Visual texture that implies touch
- Limited taste/smell (via visual metaphor)

## 4. VISUAL STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES

### 4.1 Montage and Sequence Design
#### Types of Montages
- Training montage: Time compression, skill development
- Relationship montage: Development over time
- Investigation montage: Information gathering and revelation
- Travel montage: Geographic movement and passage
- Transformation montage: Change and evolution
- Music video style: Rhythm and beat-driven editing

#### Montage Construction
- Clear beginning, middle, end within montage
- Progression and escalation visible
- Music/sound integration essential
- Transition techniques (cuts, dissolves, wipes)
- Emotional arc maintained
- Time passage indicated visually

### 4.2 Parallel Action and Cross-Cutting
- Multiple simultaneous storylines
- Building tension through intercutting
- Converging narratives
- Contrasting situations
- Time synchronization or asynchronization
- Thematic connections between scenes
- Rhythm and pacing through cutting

## 5. DIALOGUE AND ACTION INTEGRATION

### 5.1 Action During Dialogue
- Characters doing tasks while talking (naturalism)
- Physical business reveals character
- Action punctuates emotional beats
- Blocking and movement supports subtext
- Silence and pauses with action
- Listening shots and reactions

### 5.2 Visual Subtext
- What's not said shown visually
- Body language and micro-expressions
- Environmental details that comment on dialogue
- Props that reveal truth vs spoken words
- Spatial relationships between characters
- Eye line and gaze direction
- Physical distance reflecting emotional distance

## 6. LIGHTING AND MOOD

### 6.1 Lighting Patterns
#### Three-Point Lighting
- Key Light: Primary, establishes mood, 45° from camera
- Fill Light: Softens shadows, opposite key, lower intensity
- Back/Rim Light: Separation from background, dimensionality

#### Specialty Lighting
- High Key: Bright, low contrast, cheerful/comedic
- Low Key: Dark, high contrast, dramatic/mysterious
- Natural/Practical: Motivated by visible sources
- Silhouette: Backlit subject, anonymity or drama
- Chiaroscuro: Stark light/dark contrast, fine art feel

### 6.2 Time of Day and Quality
- Golden Hour: Warm, soft, romantic, flattering
- Blue Hour: Cool, ethereal, transitional
- Midday: Harsh, flat, documentary feel
- Overcast: Soft, even, neutral mood
- Night: Artificial light, moody, intimate or dangerous

## DELIVERABLES

### Scene Descriptions

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Emotional Dialogue Scene
"Write intimate conversation scene between two characters in coffee shop. Use close-ups and over-shoulder shots to capture emotional nuance. Soft, natural window light. Focus on subtext and unspoken tension."

### Example 2: Action Sequence
"Create dynamic chase scene through city streets. Mix of handheld urgency and stabilized tracking shots. High energy with quick cuts. Golden hour lighting for visual warmth contrasting with dramatic stakes."

### Example 3: Product Demonstration
"Design clean, professional product reveal scene. Slow dolly in to product on white cyc. High-key lighting with subtle shadows. Emphasize detail with macro shots. Sleek and modern aesthetic."

## Best Practices

1. **Write for the camera** - Describe only what can be filmed
2. **Use active voice** - Keep energy and momentum in prose
3. **Be specific but concise** - Vivid without verbosity
4. **Suggest, don't dictate** - Collaborate with director/DP
5. **Vary shot types** - Mix wide, medium, close for visual interest
6. **Motivate camera movement** - Every move has purpose
7. **Consider editing** - Write shots that will cut together
8. **Light for mood** - Lighting is as important as composition
9. **Show character through action** - Visual before dialogue
10. **Scout locations in mind** - Practical and achievable

## Tips for Success

- Watch films in your genre and analyze shot choices
- Create reference images/mood boards before writing
- Consider time of day for lighting continuity
- Write transitions between scenes in action lines
- Balance spectacle with storytelling (style serves story)
- Account for actors' blocking and movement
- Plan coverage for editing flexibility
- Use parentheticals sparingly in dialogue
- Describe sound and music in action lines
- Leave room for directorial interpretation and collaboration
