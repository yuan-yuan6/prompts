# Goal Setting Template

## Purpose
Create comprehensive goal-setting frameworks including objectives, action plans, and progress tracking systems to achieve personal and professional aspirations effectively.

## Quick Start

**Need to set goals quickly?** Use this minimal example:

### Minimal Example
```
Create a 6-month goal plan to transition into a data science career. Current status: 2 years as software engineer. Goals include: complete 3 online courses, build 2 portfolio projects, network with 10 data scientists, and apply to 20 positions. Track progress monthly with specific metrics.
```

### When to Use This
- Setting personal or professional development goals
- Planning career transitions or skill development
- Creating New Year's resolutions with accountability
- Establishing habits and tracking progress

### Basic 3-Step Workflow
1. **Define SMART goals** - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
2. **Create action plan** - Break down into concrete steps and milestones
3. **Track progress** - Set up regular check-ins and adjust as needed

**Time to complete**: 30-60 minutes for initial planning, 15 minutes per review
