# Popular Science Writing Readiness Assessment

## Purpose
Assess whether your science writing is ready for a popular audience by scoring six dimensions: Audience & Goal Fit, Accuracy & Sourcing, Story & Structure, Jargon Translation & Clarity, Ethics & Framing, and Publishing & Distribution. Use this to decide **ready / revise-first** and to produce an actionable improvement plan.

## Template

Conduct a popular science writing readiness assessment for {CONTENT_CONTEXT} explaining {KEY_MESSAGE} to {TARGET_AUDIENCE}.

Assess readiness across six dimensions, scoring each 1–5:

**1. AUDIENCE & GOAL FIT READINESS**
Evaluate whether the content matches reader needs: what they already know, what they care about, and what you want them to do/feel/understand. Confirm reading level is appropriate and the piece has a single primary takeaway.

**2. ACCURACY & SOURCING READINESS**
Evaluate whether claims are correct and verifiable: source quality, multiple-source confirmation, and precise wording around uncertainty. Confirm you can cite or link to the core evidence, and that you are not overstating causality, certainty, or generalizability.

**3. STORY & STRUCTURE READINESS**
Evaluate narrative flow: hook → context → question → evidence → implication → close. Confirm each section advances the reader’s understanding and that transitions are smooth. Ensure the ending reinforces the takeaway and leaves readers with the right level of confidence and nuance.

**4. JARGON TRANSLATION & CLARITY READINESS**
Evaluate whether a nonexpert can follow: jargon is defined naturally, analogies are accurate enough, and key concepts are explained with concrete examples. Confirm you’ve removed unnecessary acronyms and that terms are consistent across the piece.

**5. ETHICS & FRAMING READINESS**
Evaluate responsible communication: avoid fearmongering, sensationalism, and false balance. Confirm you handle conflicts of interest, limitations, and uncertainty transparently and respect sensitive topics and affected communities.

**6. PUBLISHING & DISTRIBUTION READINESS**
Evaluate whether the piece is ready to ship: headline/deck, visuals, captions/alt text, links, and a simple distribution plan. Confirm edits for style, tone, and fact-checking are complete and that you can respond to corrections if needed.

## Required Output Format

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** - Overall readiness score (X.X/5.0), maturity level, ready/revise-first, top 3 risks

2. **DIMENSION SCORECARD** - Table: dimension, score (1–5), evidence, biggest gap, highest-impact fix

3. **PUBLISH-READY OUTLINE**
- Working headline + 1-sentence dek
- 5–7 section outline with key sentences
- 3 analogies/examples to use
- What readers should remember (1 sentence)

4. **FACT-CHECK PLAN**
- Top 10 factual claims to verify
- Sources to verify each claim
- “Uncertainty language” decisions (must/likely/may)

5. **REVISION CHECKLIST (TOP 12)** - The exact edits to make next

---

## Maturity Scale (1–5)
- **1 — Initial:** Unclear audience/takeaway; sourcing weak; high risk of misunderstanding.
- **2 — Developing:** Engaging draft exists; major gaps in clarity, accuracy, or ethical framing.
- **3 — Defined:** Clear story with solid sourcing; needs tightening and distribution readiness.
- **4 — Managed:** Accurate, accessible, and responsibly framed; publication-ready.
- **5 — Optimized:** Highly engaging and reliable; reusable workflow; strong follow-up and correction hygiene.

## Variables (Use Max 3)

| Variable | What to include | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{CONTENT_CONTEXT}` | Format + platform + length | “1200-word magazine explainer with 2 visuals” |
| `{KEY_MESSAGE}` | One sentence takeaway | “New evidence suggests X reduces Y under Z conditions” |
| `{TARGET_AUDIENCE}` | Reader profile + knowledge level | “Educated nonexperts; curious, skeptical, time-limited” |

---

## Example (Filled)

**Input**
- `{CONTENT_CONTEXT}`: “Blog post for a public health newsletter (900–1200 words).”
- `{KEY_MESSAGE}`: “Mask fit matters more than mask type in many real-world settings.”
- `{TARGET_AUDIENCE}`: “General public; mixed trust; wants practical guidance.”

**Output (abridged)**
- Executive summary: 3.5/5 (Defined), **revise-first**
- Biggest gaps: overstated certainty; missing limitations; hook doesn’t connect to action
- Next edits: adjust claims with uncertainty language; add 3 limitations and when advice changes; add one concrete scenario; add one figure with caption and alt text

---

## Best Practices (8)

1. Write for a specific reader, not “the public.”
2. Keep one primary takeaway and repeat it in different forms.
3. Link claims to evidence; avoid “studies show” without specifics.
4. Use uncertainty language deliberately.
5. Translate jargon with examples, not just definitions.
6. Avoid sensational framing; don’t trade accuracy for clicks.
7. Add visuals that clarify, not decorate.
8. Maintain a correction path: update notes, timestamps, and sources.
